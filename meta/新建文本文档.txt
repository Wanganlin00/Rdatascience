Background: The role of PCI and TRT in ES-SCLC is controversial. We performed a systematic review of all comparative studies to investigate the benefits and harms of PCI and TRT in ES-SCLC. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, CENTRAL from date of inception and various conference proceedings from 2009 to November 2014 for eligible studies. The primary outcome is overall survival (OS). Secondary outcomes include progression-free survival (PFS), freedom from brain metastasis and toxicity. The Cochrane risk of bias instrument was used to assess the risk of methodological bias and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess the quality of evidence. Hazard ratios (HR), confidence intervals (CI), p values (p) was estimated with random effects models using Revman 5.3. Results: We found 2 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 3 non-RCTs, including 2192 patients comparing PCI versus no PCI; 4 RCTs and 1 non-RCT including 782 patients comparing TRT versus no TRT. The risk of methodological bias was low for 2 RCTs evaluating PCI and 2 RCTs evaluating TRT. Meta-analysis of these low risk bias RCTs showed that PCI decreased the risk of brain metastasis development (HR 0.43, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.60, p < 0.001, high quality evidence) but did not improve OS (HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.91, p = 0.89) or PFS (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.32, p = 0.62) (moderate quality of evidence). There was high quality evidence that TRT improved OS (HR 0.82, 95%CI 0.69 to 0.97, p = 0.02) and PFS (HR 0.76, 95%CI 0.64 to 0.89, p < 0.001). The incidence of grade 3-4 toxicities of PCI and TRT ranged from 1 to 20%. Conclusions: There was high quality evidence that PCI reduced the risk of brain metastasis development and TRT improved survival in ES- SCLC. Toxicity rates were variable and are probably related to dose and treated volume effects.
