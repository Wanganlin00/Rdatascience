TI  - Vaccination therapy for non-small-cell lung cancer
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of reviewRecent advances in our understanding of cancer immunology resulted in the development of promising therapeutic agents for either nonantigen-specific immunotherapy, for example, monoclonal antibodies targeting immune checkpoints on the T-cell lymphocyte, and antigen-specific immunotherapy or vaccination. Here, we review the recently reported results from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with the latter approach.Recent findingsSeveral trials indicated feasibility, safety, and potential for better patient outcomes. In resected early stage non-small-cell lung cancer, a phase II RCT with the MAGE-A3 vaccine showed a trend for improved disease-free interval (hazard ratio 0.75), now further evaluated in the large MAGRIT (MAGE-A3 as Adjuvant NSCLC Immunotherapy Trial) study. In stage III after chemoradiotherapy, the phase III START (Stimulating Targeted Antigenic Responses to NSCLC) trial with L-BLP25 vaccine resulted in a remarkable 10-month improvement in median survival in the concurrent chemoradiotherapy subgroup. In the advanced setting, the phase III study with the allogeneic tumor cell vaccine belagenpumatucel-L did not improve survival in the whole study, but interesting effects were seen in subgroups.SummaryRecent non-small-cell lung cancer vaccination trials did not meet their primary endpoint, but showed clear patient benefits in subgroup analyses. Confirmatory trials and identifying patients who will benefit using predictive factors, will hopefully bring these approaches in the clinic in the near future.

TI  - Small Cell Lung Cancer: Where Do We Go From Here?
T2  - CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive disease that accounts for approximately 14% of all lung cancers. In the United States, approximately 31,000 patients are diagnosed annually with SCLC. Despite numerous clinical trials, including at least 40 phase 3 trials since the 1970s, systemic treatment for patients with SCLC has not changed significantly in the past several decades. Consequently, the 5-year survival rate remains low at <7% overall, and most patients survive for only 1 year or less after diagnosis. Unlike nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), in which major advances have been made using targeted therapies, there are still no approved targeted drugs for SCLC. Significant barriers to progress in SCLC include 1) a lack of early detection modalities, 2) limited tumor tissue for translational research (eg, molecular profiling of DNA, RNA, and/or protein alterations) because of small diagnostic biopsies and the rare use of surgical resection in standard treatment, and 3) rapid disease progression with poor understanding of the mechanisms contributing to therapeutic resistance. In this report, the authors review the current state of SCLC treatment, recent advances in current understanding of the underlying disease biology, and opportunities to advance translational research and therapeutic approaches for patients with SCLC. Cancer 2015;121:664-672. (c) 2014 American Cancer Society.The treatment of small cell lung cancer has not changed significantly in 3 decades. In this review, the authors discuss the current challenges and opportunities to accelerate progress in this highly lethal disease.

TI  - Current Surgical Indications for Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The management strategy for the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has been transformed by our improved understanding of the cancer biology and concomitant development of novel systemic therapies. Complete surgical resection of NSCLC continues to offer the best chance for cure or local and regional disease control, and with improvements in minimally invasive techniques and enhanced recovery, the morbidity associated with surgical resection has been reduced. Patient-centered multi-disciplinary discussions that consider surgical therapy are associated with improved outcomes. Provided with promising novel therapeutic modalities including immune checkpoint inhibitors with or without chemotherapy, stereotactic radiotherapy, and targeted systemic therapies, indications for surgery continue to evolve and have expanded to include selected patients with advanced and metastatic disease.With recent strides made within the field of thoracic oncology, the management of NSCLC is evolving rapidly. Careful patient selection and timing of multi-modality therapy to permit the optimization of therapeutic benefit must be pursued. While chemotherapy and radiotherapy continue to have a role in the management of lung cancer, surgical therapy remains an essential component of lung cancer treatment in early, locally and regionally advanced, as well as in selected, cases of metastatic disease. Recent and most impactful advances in the treatment of lung cancer relate to the advent of immunotherapy and targeted therapy, molecular profiling, and predictive biomarker discovery. Many of these systemic therapies are a part of the standard of care in metastatic NSCLC, and their indications are expanding towards surgically operable lung cancer to improve survival outcomes. Numerous completed and ongoing clinical trials in the surgically operable NSCLC speak to the interest and importance of the multi-modality therapy even in earlier stages of NSCLC. In this review, we focus on the current standard of care indications for surgical therapy in stage I-IV NSCLC as well as on the anticipated future direction of multi-disciplinary lung cancer therapy.

TI  - A Neuro-oncologist's Perspective on Management of Brain Metastases in Patients with EGFR Mutant Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
T2  - CURRENT TREATMENT OPTIONS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Management of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with brain metastasis (BrM) has been revolutionized by identification of molecular subsets that have targetable oncogenes. Historically, survival for NSCLC with symptomatic BrM was weeks to months. Now, many patients are surviving years with limited data to guide treatment decisions. Tumors with activating mutations in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFRact+) have a higher incidence of BrM, but a longer overall survival. The high response rate of both systemic and BrM EGFRact+ NSCLC to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has led to the rapid incorporation of new therapies but is outpacing evidence-based decisions for BrM in NSCLC. While whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) was the foundation of management of BrM, extended survival raises concerns for the subacute and late effects radiotherapy. We favor the use of TKIs and delaying the use of WBRT when able. At inevitable disease progression, we consider alternative dosing schedules to increase CNS penetration (such as pulse dosing of erlotinib) or advance to next generation TKI if available. We utilize local control options of surgery or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for symptomatic accessible lesions based on size and edema. At progression despite available TKIs, we use pemetrexed-based platinum doublet chemotherapy or immunotherapy if the tumor has high expression of PDL-1. We reserve the use of WBRT for patients with more than 10 BrM and progression despite TKI and conventional chemotherapy, if performance status is appropriate.

TI  - Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Treatment with Molecularly Targeted Therapy and Concurrent Radiotherapy-A Review
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - Lung cancer is the leading cause of death worldwide for both men and women. Surgery can be offered as a radical treatment at stages I and II and selected cases of stage III (III A). Whereas at more advanced stages, combined modalities of treatment are applied: radiochemotherapy (IIIB) and molecularly targeted treatment (small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors, VEGF receptor inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, and immunological treatment with monoclonal antibodies). Combination treatment, composed of radiotherapy and molecular therapy, is increasingly employed in locally advanced and metastatic lung cancer management. Recent studies have indicated a synergistic effect of such treatment and modification of immune response. The combination of immunotherapy and radiotherapy may result in the enhancement of the abscopal effect. Anti-angiogenic therapy, in combination with RT, is associated with high toxicity and should be not recommended. In this paper, the authors discuss the role of molecular treatment and the possibility of its concurrent use with radiotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

TI  - Systemic and Radiation Therapy Approaches for Locally Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The treatment for locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer has changed dramatically over the past several years, with consolidative immunotherapy after concurrent chemoradiation becoming the new standard of care. Five-year survival outcomes have substantially improved with this approach. Despite these advances, further improvements are needed as the majority of patients ultimately develop progression of disease. The next-generation immunotherapy trials are currently being conducted that include approaches such as concurrent immunotherapy and addition of other therapeutic agents in the concurrent and consolidative settings. Specific unmet needs continue to exist for patients who develop disease progression after concurrent chemoradiation and immunotherapy, as well as defining the best treatment for patients with driver mutations. Future directions also include refinement of radiation techniques to reduce toxicities as much as possible, as well as the use of circulating tumor DNA in the surveillance setting. The current scientific landscape shows promising approaches that may further improve outcomes for patients with locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.

TI  - Correlation of Radiation Pneumonitis History Before Nivolumab with Onset of Interstitial Lung Disease and Progression-free Survival of Patients with Pre-treated Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
T2  - ANTICANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background/Aim: Nivolumab has a promising efficacy for patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) as second-line or later treatment, and after radiotherapy as abscopal effect. However, the effects of radiation pneumonitis history before nivolumab have not been clarified. Therefore, we retrospectively analyzed the correlation of a history of radiation pneumonitis before nivolumab with onset of interstitial lung disease (ILD) and progression-free survival (PFS) after nivolumab treatment in patients with previously treated NSCLC. Patients and Methods: A total of 201 patients treated with nivolumab were retrospectively reviewed. We collected clinical data of patients at the time of starting nivolumab and we evaluated ILD incidence and PFS in relation to patient characteristics, including radiation pneumonitis history. Results: The median age was 68 years; 135 patients were men, 157 had a smoking history, and 153 had performance status of 0 or 1. Thirty-four patients experienced radiation pneumonitis before nivolumab, and 50 patients received radiotherapy to the chest (31 patients received curative radiotherapy). The overall median PFS was 2.8 months and the overall ILD rate was 12.4%. Higher ILD incidence was observed in the group with a history of radiation pneumonitis (26.5%) compared to the group without radiation pneumonitis (9.6%). The median PFS was 3.6 and 2.3 months, respectively. On multivariate analysis, a history of radiation pneumonitis was also significantly correlated with good PFS (p= 0.023). Conclusion: Although increasing the risk of ILD, a history of radiation pneumonitis before nivolumab also contributes to the prolongation of PFS after nivolumab.

TI  - Combination of the EP and Anti-PD-1 Pathway or Anti-CTLA-4 for the Phase III Trial of Small-Cell Lung Cancer: A Meta-Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The morbidity and mortality of lung cancer remain one of the highest among multiple cancers, respectively. Small-Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) accounts for around 10%-15% of all lung cancers. Approximately two-thirds of the diagnosed SCLCs are in extensive stage (ES). Decades later, we still rely on the same traditional regimen with etoposide and platinum (EP) as the mainstay of treatment with poor prognosis. This meta-analysis aims to assess the effect of adding Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (CPIs) such as (ipilimumab, atezolizumab, pembrolizumab, and durvalumab) to the traditional EP regimen for small-cell lung cancer extensive stage (ES-SCLC). We searched through PubMed looking for studies that compare between EP and CPIs, with EP alone, and only Phase III randomized controlled trials were considered eligible for this study. A total of 3645 papers were the results of the initial search, and only 4 studies met our criteria. Each investigator extracted the data independently using the PRISMA MODEL (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guideline. Each author used a prespecified sheet. The primary endpoint was to calculate OS (overall survival) and PFS (progression-free survival) hazard ratios for both arms. We found that adding EP plus CPIs increased both OS (HR, 95% CI 0.80 [0.70, 0.93], P = 0.0001, I-2 = 49%) and PFS (HR95% CI 0.81 [0.74, 0.88], P < 0.00001, I-2 = 0%). On the other hand, ORR (overall response rate) was not affected by the addition of CPIs to EP compared to EP alone, and the same was true for adverse events. To conclude, CTLA-4 alone is not encouraging, but PD-1/PD-L1 adds survival benefits. A combined treatment regimen shows to be more effective, improving overall survival rate Durvalumab and atezolizumab showed improvement for OS, but pembrolizumab and ipilimumab did not show a significant increase of OS over EP; however, pembrolizumab showed significant prolongation of the disease-free period.

TI  - Management of Oncogene Driven Locally Advanced Unresectable Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
T2  - EXPERT REVIEW OF ANTICANCER THERAPY
M3  - Review
AB  - IntroductionThe current standard of care of locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC) is concurrent chemoradiation, followed by consolidation durvalumab. However, there is evidence that the efficacy of chemoradiation and also immunotherapy in many oncogene-positive LA-NSCLC are attenuated, and dependent on the subgroup.Areas coveredWe will firstly review the outcomes of standard-of-care therapy in oncogene-driven LA-NSCLC. We looked at various oncogene driven subgroups and the tumor microenvironment that may explain differential response. Finally, we review the role of targeted therapy in the treatment of LA-NSCLC.Expert opinionEach oncogene-positive subgroup should be treated as its own entity, and continued efforts should be undertaken to incorporate targeted therapy, which is likely to yield superior survival outcomes if trial design can be optimized and toxicities can be managed.

TI  - First-line immunotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer diagnosed with brain metastases
T2  - REVUE DES MALADIES RESPIRATOIRES
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction. - Up to 30% patients newly diagnosed with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) present with brain metastases. In the absence of oncogenic addiction, first-line immunotherapy, alone or in combination with chemotherapy, is the current standard of care. This review aims to synthesize the available data regarding the efficacy of immunotherapy in these patients, and to discuss the possibility of its being coordinated with local treatments such as radiotherapy. State of the art. - NSCLC patients with brain metastases appear to have survival benefits with immunotherapy similar to those of NSCLC patients without brain metastases. However, this finding is based on mainly prospective studies having included highly selected patients with pre-treated and stable brain metastases. Several retrospective studies and two prospective single-arm studies have confirmed the intracranial efficacy of immunotherapy, either alone or in combination with chemotherapy. Perspectives. - The indications and optimal timing for cerebral radiotherapy remain subjects of debate. To date, there exists no randomized study assessing the addition of brain radiotherapy to first-line immunotherapy. That said, a recent meta-analysis showed increased intracerebral response when radiotherapy complemented immunotherapy. Conclusions. - For NSCLC patients with brain metastases, the available data suggest a clear benefit of first-line immunotherapy, whether alone or combined with chemotherapy. However, most of these data are drawn from retrospective, non-randomized studies with small sample sizes. (c) 2024 SPLF. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

TI  - Treatment strategies for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer in elderly patients: Translating scientific evidence into clinical practice
T2  - CRITICAL REVIEWS IN ONCOLOGY HEMATOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Treatment of locally advanced NSCLC (LA-NSCLC) is focused on multimodal strategy, including chemotherapy and radiotherapy (in combination or as alternative treatments), followed by surgery in selected cases. Recently, durvalumab consolidation after definitive chemo-radiation has shown a meaningful overall survival benefit. However, it is important to note that elderly patients represent a high proportion of NSCLC population and frailty and comorbidities can significantly limit treatment options. Indeed, elderly patients are under-represented in clinical trials and data to drive treatment selection in this category of patients are scanty. Available data, main issues and controversies on multimodal treatment in elderly LA-NSCLC patients will be reviewed in this paper.

AB  - Locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC) is composed of heterogeneous subgroups that require a multidisciplinary team approach in order to ensure optimal therapy for each patient. Since 2010, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network has recommended chemoradiation therapy (CRT) for bulky mediastinal disease and surgical combination for those patients with single-station N2 involvement who respond to neoadjuvant therapy. According to lung cancer tumor boards, thoracic surgeons make a decision on the resectability of the tumor, if it is determined to be unresectable, concurrent CRT (CCRT) is considered the next choice. However, the survival benefit of CCRT over sequential CRT or radiotherapy alone carries the risk of additional toxicity. Considering severe adverse events that may lead to death, fit patients who are able to tolerate CCRT must be identified by multidisciplinary tumor board. Decelerated approaches, such as sequential CRT or high-dose radiation alone may be a valuable alternative for patients who are not eligible for CCRT. As a new treatment strategy, investigators are interested in the application of the innovative radiation techniques, trimodality therapy combining surgery after high-dose definitive CCRT, and the combination of radiation with targeted or immunotherapy agents. The updated results and on-going studies are thoroughly reviewed in this article.

TI  - Programmed death ligand 1 immunohistochemistry in non-small cell lung carcinoma
T2  - JOURNAL OF THORACIC DISEASE
M3  - Review
AB  - Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide with low response rates to conventional chemotherapy. New promising therapies have emerged based on programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) immunity checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), including anti-PD-1, such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab, or programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors, such as atezolizumab, durvalumab, and avelumab. The prescription of pembrolizumab has been approved by FDA and EMA for advanced stages non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), restricted for first-line setting to patients whose tumor presents >= 50% of PD-L1 positive tumor cells (TC), and >= 1% for second-line and beyond, leading to consider PD-L1 assay as a companion diagnostic tool for pembrolizumab. Very recently, the EMA has approved durvalumab for the treatment of patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC not progressing after chemoradiotherapy and whose tumors express PD-L1 on >= 1% of TC. Four standardized PD-L1 immunohistochemistry assays have been used in clinical trials; 22C3 and 28-8 PharmDx assays on Dako/Agilent platforms, and SP142 and SP263 assays on Ventana platforms, each test having been developed initially for a specific ICI. They differ in terms of primary monoclonal antibody, platform, detection system and scoring methods with different thresholds of positivity validated in clinical trials. Several studies have shown a close analytical performance of the 22C3, 28-8 and SP263 assays regarding TC staining in NSCLC, with poor concordance with SP142 assay and for immune cells. However, as dedicated platforms are not available in all pathology laboratories and because of the high cost of these assays, laboratory developed tests are widely used in many countries. Their validation must guarantee the same sensitivities and specificities as compared to standardized assays. Overall, PD-L1 test is of great help to select patients who could benefit for ICI and most pathologists have included this test in their daily practice for advanced stages NSCLC, besides ALK and ROS1 IHC.

TI  - Navigate Towards the Immunotherapy Era: Value of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients With Brain Metastases
T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Brain metastases (BMs) in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients are associated with significant morbidity and poor prognosis. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have resulted in a paradigm shift in the management of advanced NSCLC. However, the value of ICIs in NSCLC patients with BMs remains unclear because patients with BMs are routinely excluded in numerous prospective trials on ICIs. Here, starting from the mechanisms of ICIs for BMs, we will reveal the value of ICIs by reviewing the efficacy and adverse effects of ICIs monotherapy as well as promising combination strategies, such as combinations with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and anti-angiogenic drugs, etc. In addition, the methods of patient selection and response assessment will be summarized to assist clinical practice and further studies.

AB  - Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for approximately 10-15% of all lung cancers. No significant improvement has been made for patients with SCLC in the past several decades. The main progresses were the thoracic radiation and prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) that improved the patient survival rate. For patients with limited disease and good performance status (PS), concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) followed by PCI should be considered. For extensive disease, the combination of etoposide and platinum-based chemotherapy remains the standard treatment and consolidative thoracic radiotherapy is beneficial for patients who have a significant respond to initial chemotherapy. However, the prognosis still remains poor. Recently, efforts have been focused on molecular targets and immunotherapy. But numerous molecular targets methods have failed to show a significant clinical benefit in patients with SCLC. It is anticipated that further development of research will depend on the on-going trials for molecular targeted therapy and immunotherapy which are promising and may improve the outcomes for SCLC in the next decade.

TI  - Outcomes of first-line anti-PD-L1 blockades combined with brain radiotherapy for extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer with brain metastasis
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEURO-ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Anti-programmed cell death-ligand 1 (Anti-PD-L1) blockades have become the first-line treatment of extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) from CASPIAN and IMpower133 trials. SCLC has a high incidence of brain metastasis (BM) and brain radiotherapy (BRT) is the main local treatment method, but there is limited data on the BRT-immunotherapy scheme. The aim of the retrospective study is to investigate the clinical efficacy and safety of the first-line anti-PD-L1 blockades combined with BRT in ES-SCLC with BM. Methods Patients with newly diagnosed ES-SCLC with baseline BMs at Shandong Cancer Hospital and Research Institute between 2017 and 2021 were selected. Patients were divided into the anti-PD-L1+BRT group and BRT group. We also assessed the leukoencephalopathy in both groups. Results A total of 46 patients were selected. Fifteen were divided into anti-PD-L1+BRT group and 31 to BRT group. The median overall survival (OS) was not reached (NR) vs 15.9 m (P = 0.172). Progression-free survival (PFS) was numerically prolonged with anti-PD-L1 blockades, but the significance was not reached (median: 9.4 m vs 7.4 m, P = 0.362). The median intracranial PFS was not improved, neither (median: 8.2 m vs 8.9 m, P = 0.620). Objective response rate (ORR) in the two groups was 73.33% vs 77.42% (P = 0.949) and disease control rate (DCR) was both 100%. Intracranial ORR and DCR were 53.33% vs 70.97% (P = 0.239) and 73.33% vs 80.65% (P = 0.855), respectively. There was no significant difference in leukoencephalopathy incidence between the two groups. Conclusion The combination of first-line anti-PD-L1 blockades with BRT did not confer a significant survival benefit in ES-SCLC with BM, without enhancing cranial neurotoxicity.

TI  - A new hope: the immunotherapy in small cell lung cancer
T2  - NEOPLASMA
M3  - Review
AB  - Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is of a high-grade malignancy with a high metastatic potential and poor clinical prognosis. Unfortunately, SCLC initially exhibits a good response to chemotherapy and radiation therapy, but inevitably, relapses decrease patients' chance of survival. Despite tremendous advances on the development of new chemotherapeutic agents, the prognosis of this disease remains poor. Immunotherapy plays a role in eliciting an anticancer response by modulating the patient's immune response of the tumor. Several studies have demonstrated that abnormal autoimmune regulation has a close relationship with SCLC. Thus, several immunotherapy trials are focused on SCLC treatment, including such approaches as immune checkpoints blockers, tumor vaccine, antigenic targets and adoptive cellular immunotherapy to benefit patients with SCLC. To date, the results from immunotherapy in SCLC have not been promising. For example, tumor vaccines have not been demonstrated to have a significant survival benefit. However, there have been many promising advances with immune checkpoints blockers. This review will provide a general overview of immunotherapy in SCLC. The landmark clinical trials in previous successful immunotherapy studies are summarized here. Finally, the challenges of immunotherapy in SCLC are discussed to facilitate the prediction of possible and valuable strategies for future therapy.

TI  - IFCT-1502 CLINIVO: real-world evidence of long-term survival with nivolumab in a nationwide cohort of patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer
T2  - ESMO OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Immunotherapy using inhibitors targeting immune checkpoint programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) is currently the standard of care in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Materials and methods: We carried out a nationwide cohort retrospective study of consecutive patients with advanced, refractory NSCLC who received nivolumab as second to later lines of treatment as part of the expanded access program. Key objectives were to assess the efficacy and safety of nivolumab and the efficacy of first postnivolumab treatment.Results: Nine hundred and two patients were enrolled: 317 (35%) with squamous cell carcinoma and 585 (65%) with nonsquamous cell carcinoma. Median age was 64 years; there were 630 (70%) men, 795 (88%) smokers, 723 (81%) patients with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0/1, 197 (22%) patients with brain metastases, and 212 (27%) with liver metastases. Best response was partial response for 16.2% and stable disease (SD) for 30.5%. Progression-free survival and overall survival (OS) rates at 2, 3, and 5 years were 8% and 25%, 6% and 16%, and 4% and 10%, respectively. At multivariate analysis, ECOG PS >= 2 [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.13, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.78-2.55, P < 0.001], squamous histology (HR = 1.17, 95% CI 1.01-1.36, P = 0.04), and presence of central nervous system metastases (HR = 1.29, 95% CI 1.08-1.54, P = 0.005) were significantly associated with lower OS. Four hundred and ninety-two patients received at least one treatment after discontinuation of nivolumab, consisting of systemic therapies in 450 (91%). Radiation therapy was delivered to 118 (24%) patients.Conclusion: The CLINIVO cohort represents the largest real-world evidence cohort with the use of immune checkpoint inhibitor in advanced, metastatic NSCLC after failure of first-line chemotherapy, with long-term follow-up and analysis of subsequent therapies. Our data confirm the efficacy of nivolumab in a cohort larger than that reported in landmark clinical trials and identify prognostic factors, which reinforces the need for accurate selection of patients for treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Our data indicate that oligoprogression is frequent after nivolumab exposure and provide a unique insight into the long-term survival.

TI  - Total Metabolic Tumor Volume on 18F-FDG PET/CT Is a Useful Prognostic Biomarker for Patients with Extensive Small-Cell Lung Cancer Undergoing First-Line Chemo-Immunotherapy
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Chemotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors is the new standard of care for first-line systemic therapy in extensive small-cell lung cancer. The identification of biomarkers for patients that are likely or not likely to respond to such therapy is critical. We aimed at determining whether imaging could help to predict outcomes among these patients. We showed that the total metabolic tumor burden, extracted from pre-treatment 18-FDG PET/CT imaging, may be a useful biomarker associated with survival. Finally, we think that this result should be taken into account in clinical trials, and that it might need further validation through large, independent, and prospective cohorts. Background: We aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of imaging biomarkers on 18F-FDG PET/CT in extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) patients undergoing first-line chemo-immunotherapy. Methods: In this multicenter and retrospective study, we considered two cohorts, depending on the type of first-line therapy: chemo-immunotherapy (CIT) versus chemotherapy alone (CT). All patients underwent baseline 18-FDG PET/CT before therapy between June 2016 and September 2021. We evaluated clinical, biological, and PET parameters, and used cutoffs from previously published studies or predictiveness curves to assess the association with progression-free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS) with Cox prediction models. Results: Sixty-eight patients were included (CIT: CT) (36: 32 patients). The median PFS was 5.9:6.5 months, while the median OS was 12.1:9.8 months. dNLR (the derived neutrophils/(leucocytes-neutrophils) ratio) was an independent predictor of short PFS and OS in the two cohorts (p < 0.05). High total metabolic tumor volume (TMTVhigh if > 241 cm(3)) correlated with outcomes, but only in the CIT cohort (PFS for TMTVhigh in multivariable analysis: HR 2.5; 95%CI 1.1-5.9). Conclusion: Baseline 18F-FDG PET/CT using TMTV could help to predict worse outcomes for ES-SCLC patients undergoing first-line CIT. This suggests that baseline TMTV may be used to identify patients that are unlikely to benefit from CIT.

AB  - In 2017, major advances in the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) continued to emanate from the fields of molecularly targeted therapy and immunotherapy. In the former, new drugs with improved efficacy and reduced toxicity entered the clinic; in the latter, immune-checkpoint inhibition proved efficacious after chemoradiotherapy for stage III disease, but had disparate results in the frontline treatment of stage IV disease.

T2  - Lung Cancer (Auckland, N.Z.)
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - The era of immunotherapy has changed the face of how we approach treatment for many oncologic and hematologic malignancies. Lung cancer has been in the forefront of checkpoint inhibition for the past 2 years and has paved the path for other subspecialties. While PD-1 inhibitors nivolumab and pembrolizumab have been approved for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), this review focuses on atezolizumab, its landmark studies, and ongoing trials. Atezolizumab is the first programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor to receive US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for metastatic NSCLC patients who have progressed on frontline chemotherapy. This approval was based on two open-label Phase II multicenter trials, POPLAR (NCT01903993) and BIRCH (NCT02031458). Both studies revealed a benefit in overall survival (OS), progression-free survival, and response rate in the atezolizumab arm when compared to single-agent docetaxol. There were also fewest Grade 3-5 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) in the atezolizumab cohort. The open-label randomized Phase III OAK trial (NCT02008227) further established the role of atezolizumab in previously treated NSCLC. This study compared atezolizumab with docetaxel in patients with advanced NSCLC (squamous or nonsquamous histologies) who had progressed on one to two prior chemotherapy regimens. OS in the PD-L1-enriched population was superior in the atezolizumab arm (n=241) at 15.7 months compared with docetaxel (n=222) at 10.3 months (hazard ratio [HR] 0.74, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.58-0.93; p=0.0102). Patients lacking PD-L1 also had survival benefit with atezolizumab with a median OS (mOS) of 12.6 months versus 8.9 months with chemotherapy (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.59-0.96). Benefit was noted in both squamous and nonsquamous NSCLC subsets and regardless of PD-L1 expressivity. As seen in the POPLAR and BIRCH studies, the toxicity profile was significantly better with immunotherapy. The future is unfolding rapidly as new checkpoint inhibitors are gaining FDA approval. It is still not known if these agents will be used in combination with chemotherapy, with other immune-modulating agents, radiation therapy, or all of the above. The results of these studies investigating their use in combination with chemotherapy agents, with other immunotherapy agents such as CTLA-4 inhibitors, and with radiation therapy, are eagerly awaited.

T2  - TRANSLATIONAL LUNG CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for more than 85% of all lung cancers. Platinum-based doublet chemotherapy is the standard first-line treatment for metastatic NSCLC when genomic testing reveals no targetable alteration such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) or ROS1 translocation/re-arrangements. But, chemotherapy produces response rates ranging only between 15-30%. For patients whose disease progresses on first-line chemotherapy, second-line therapy historically consists of taxane-based salvage chemotherapy with a response rate of less than 25%. Recently, immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitor agents have demonstrated responses in advanced NSCLC, with some patients exhibiting durable responses after discontinuing therapy. In 2015, two immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting programmed cell death-1 (PD-1), nivolumab and pembrolizumab were approved for secondline therapy of NSCLC. In 2016, another checkpoint inhibitor targeting program death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), atezolizumab was approved for the same indication. Moreover, pembrolizumab also received approval in 2016 for first-line NSCLC treatment in patients with high PD-L1 expressing tumors. Immunotherapy for NSCLC has therefore, recently evolved into a true treatment modality with the acceptance of PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors as the new standard of care for second-line treatment. However, it is still at the discretion of the treating physician whether to use PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor as data to compare these two pathways is lacking. Focus is now also on exploring their role in the adjuvant and consolidation settings for NSCLC as well as on exploring novel combinations combining these agents with chemotherapy or radiation. Research is also needed in the development of predictive and prognostic biomarkers for these agents. While vaccine therapy trials in NSCLC have so far failed to show significant clinical benefit, the demonstration of enhanced immune response in these trials suggest the vaccine therapy needs additional evaluation in combination with other therapeutic modalities especially checkpoint inhibition.

TI  - Current status and progress of concurrent chemoradiotherapy in patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer prior to the approval of durvalumab
T2  - THORACIC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The standard treatment for patients with unresectable locally advanced (LA) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Consolidation therapy with durvalumab after CRT demonstrated survival benefits and was approved in Japan in July 2018. The use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) is entering routine oncological practice, and here we investigate the feasibility of concurrent CRT for LA-NSCLC patients based on the PACIFIC criteria.Methods We performed a retrospective study to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of concurrent CRT prior to the approval of durvalumab. We assessed consecutive patients with LA-NSCLC treated with CRT between January 2012 and June 2018.Results We analyzed a total of 108 consecutive patients who received radical thoracic radiotherapy and concurrent platinum-based chemotherapy. Of those patients, 105 (97%) completed the planned radiotherapy. Radiation pneumonitis was observed in 93 patients (85%), with a median of 130 days (range: 41-317 days) from the initiation of radiation to the onset of the complication. Among the patients, 74 (69%) were considered eligible for consolidation therapy with durvalumab. The overall response rate was 64%, and the two-year survival rate was 63%. Patients who received an ICI after relapse were associated with significantly better survival than those who did not receive an ICI (two-year survival rate: 87% vs. 41%, respectively; P = 0.001).Conclusions Prior to the approval of durvalumab, the clinical application of ICIs improved the outcome of patients with relapsed NSCLC after CRT for LA-NSCLC. The management of radiation pneumonitis remains a challenge following the approval of durvalumab.

TI  - New therapies in small cell lung cancer: A narrative review
T2  - PNEUMON
M3  - Article
AB  - Lung cancer overall is the second most common malignancy in both men and women in the United States and remains the leading cause of cancer death. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for approximately 10-15% of all cases. Chemotherapy with a platinum agent and etoposide remains the standard of care for limited -stage patients. In the past few years, several clinical trials have evaluated the efficacy of immunotherapy, when added to conventional chemotherapy, in extensive -stage patients, and two anti -PD -L1 monoclonal antibodies, atezolizumab and durvalumab, have already been approved by the USA Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in this setting. Moreover, numerous other new agents are currently being investigated while new molecular features of SCLC subtypes come to light. Further analysis of predictive biomarkers needs to be done as well as evaluation of immune checkpoint inhibitors in early -stage disease.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of durvalumab plus chemotherapy vs. atezolizumab plus chemotherapy in the treatment of small-cell lung cancer: a retrospective comparative cohort study
T2  - JOURNAL OF THORACIC DISEASE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Durvalumab and atezolizumab have recently been approved in extensive small cell lung cancer (SCLC) with moderate median overall survival (OS) improvements. However, only limited data exist regarding the impact of immunotherapy in real-world SCLC patients. This study sought to assess the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab plus chemotherapy and durvalumab plus chemotherapy in the treatment of SCLC in a real-world setting.Methods: A retrospective cohort study of all patients treated for SCLC with chemotherapy with PD-L1 inhibitor, at 3 centers in China between February 1, 2020 and April 30, 2022. Patient characteristics, adverse-events and survival analyses were conducted.Results: A total of 143 patients were enrolled in this study, 100 were treated with durvalumab and the remainder with atezolizumab. The baseline characteristics of the two groups were fundamentally balanced before using PD-L1 inhibitors (P>0.05). The median OS (mOS) of the patients who received durvalumab or atezolizumab as the first-line treatment were 22.0 and 10.0 months, respectively (P=0.03). Survival analysis of patients with brain metastasis (BM) revealed that the median progression-free survival (mPFS) of patients without BM treated with durvalumab plus chemotherapy (5.5 months) was longer than that of those with BM (4.0 months) (P=0.03). In contrast, in the atezolizumab plus chemotherapy regimen, BM did not affect survival. In addition, the addition of radiotherapy to treatment with PD-L1 inhibitors in combination with chemotherapy has a tendency to improve long-term survival. As for safety analysis, there was no significant difference in the incidence of immune-related adverse events (IRAEs) during PD-L1 inhibitor therapy between the 2 groups (P>0.05). And during treatment with immunochemotherapy, radiotherapy was not associated with the development of IRAE (P=0.42) but increased the risk of immune-related pneumonitis (P=0.026).Conclusions: The implication of this study for clinical practice is a preference for durvalumab in first-line immunotherapy for SCLC. In addition, appropriate radiotherapy during treatment with PD-L1 inhibitors in combination with chemotherapy may prolong long-term survival, but the occurrence of immune-related pneumonitis should be vigilant. Data from this study are limited and the baseline characteristics of the two populations still need to be more finely classified.

TI  - Molecular targeted therapy for early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer: Will it increase the cure rate?
T2  - LUNG CANCER
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents approximately 85% of all lung cancer cases, with a worldwide annual incidence of around 1.3 million. Surgery remains the corner stone of treatment in early-stage NSCLC when feasible, and the addition of adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy has improved these results in resected NSCLC patients. For those patients with non-metastatic NSCLC not suitable for complete surgical resection, chemotherapy plus radiotherapy remains the best treatment option. For patients with metastatic NSCLC, molecular targeted agents have become part of the therapeutic arsenal in recent years. However, to date no targeted agent has been approved for patients with early or locally-advanced stages of NSCLC. Here, we review the rationale, literature and studies addressing the role of targeted agents used in the adjuvant setting or as part of chemoradiotherapy regimens. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

TI  - Therapeutic options for oligoprogressive non-small cell lung cancer
T2  - REVUE DES MALADIES RESPIRATOIRES
M3  - Review
AB  - Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality and more than half of the cases are diagnosed at a metastatic stage. Major progress in terms of systemic treatments has been achieved in recent decades. Access to new anti-PD-(L) 1 immunotherapies and targeted therapies for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with oncogenic addiction such as EGFR mutation or ALK rearrangement have led to improved outcomes. Patients with limited progression of their disease during systemic treatment may be a particular subgroup. This oligoprogressive state is characterized by a limited number of sites in progression, implying that the other sites remain controlled and therefore sensitive to systemic treatments. The advent of non-invasive techniques such as stereotactic radiotherapy, radiofrequency, and mini-invasive surgery has led to a precise re-evaluation of local ablative treatments in this situation. Local treatment of the oligoprogressive lesion(s) may allow modification of the natural history of the disease, maintenance of effective systemic targeted treatment and, ultimately, to improved survival. Data validating an aggressive local therapeutic approach in oligoprogressive NSCLC patients are currently limited and essentially retrospective. Several international trials are underway that could confirm the clinical benefit of radical local treatment in oligoprogressive advanced NSCLC patients. (C) 2019 SPLF.

TI  - Comparative beneficiary effects of immunotherapy against chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC: Meta-analysis and systematic review
T2  - ONCOLOGY LETTERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Lung cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among men and it is the third ranked in women. There are two major types of lung cancer, namely, small cell lung cancer (SCLC), which accounts for similar to 20% of the cases, and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which is the most common. Chemotherapy and chemoradiotherapy have been used as the first-line therapies but suffer from lack of efficacy and also of several toxic adverse effects. Immunotherapeutic approaches including tumor antigen vaccination, monoclonal antibodies targeting checkpoint pathways and also activated immune cells are being developed and have been shown to be effective in treating NSCLC. Despite their promise, efficacy of several immunotherapies has not been consistent. We undertook this meta-analysis study to analyze results from clinical trials that compared efficacy and safety of immunotherapies with placebo or chemotherapy/radiotherapy in improving overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) of NSCLC patients. Various databases were searched to identify randomized clinical studies examining the efficacy and safety of antibody-and vaccine-based immunotherapies in NSCLC patients in comparison to chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy or placebo. Effects on OS and PFS and also adverse events have been compared. In accordance with the selection criteria, a total of 13 studies with 3,513 patients in immunotherapy and 3,072 patients in chemotherapy/placebo, were selected. PFS (odds ratio 1.81, 95% CI 1.36, 2.42; P<0.0001) and OS (P<0.0001) are found to be greatly improved by immunotherapies. Immunotherapy of NSCLC patients was also found to prevent several adverse effects and to improve daily living ability of the patients. The present meta-analysis strongly suggests that immunotherapy improves OS and PFS of patients with NSCLC.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION ONCOLOGY BIOLOGY PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Chemoradiotherapy (CRT) followed by consolidation immune checkpoint inhibitors significantly improves survival in unresectable locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer. However, the optimal sequence for CRT and immune checkpoint inhibitors has not yet been established. We investigated the dynamics of peripheral blood immune cells during CRT to determine the best sequence for treatment.Methods and Materials: Peripheral blood samples were prospectively collected pretreatment, weekly during CRT for 6 weeks, and 1 month posttreatment in 24 patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer who received definitive CRT. Immune cell analysis was performed by flow cytometry. Ex vivo PD-1 blockade assays were performed by IFN-gamma intracellular cytokine staining.Results: Lymphopenia was prominently observed during CRT and mostly recovered 1 month post-CRT. Robust proliferation of CD8(+) T cells was induced, peaking in the last week during CRT and decreasing post-CRT. The robust proliferation of CD8(+) T cells led to an increase in the frequency of CD28-CD57(+) replicative senescent and terminally differentiated cells post-CRT. Tumor-reactive CD8(+) T cells increased during CRT and peaked in the last week. One month post-CRT, the frequency of tumor-reactive CD8(+) T cells decreased and TOXhiTCF1lo terminally exhausted CD8(+) T cells significantly increased. Anti-PD-1-induced functional restoration of PD-1+CD8(+) T cells was maximized in the last week of CRT and significantly decreased post-CRT.Conclusions: The findings suggest that earlier administration of PD-1 blockade may be associated with superior efficacy compared with delayed administration after completion of CRT. These findings provide an immunologic rationale for optimal timing of combining immune checkpoint inhibitors with CRT in clinical trials.(C) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

M3  - Review
AB  - Brain metastases are common among patients with lung cancer and have been associated with significant morbidity and limited survival. However, the treatment of brain metastases has evolved as the field has advanced in terms of central nervous system imaging, surgical technique, and radiotherapy technology. This has allowed patients to receive improved treatment with less toxicity and more durable benefit. In addition, there have been significant advances in systemic therapy for lung cancer in recent years, and several treatments including chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy exhibit activity in the central nervous system. Utilizing systemic therapy for treating brain metastases can avoid or delay local therapy and often allows patients to receive effective treatment for both intracranial and extracranial disease. Determining the appropriate treatment for patients with lung cancer brain metastases therefore requires a clear understanding of intracranial disease burden, tumor histology, molecular characteristics, and overall cancer prognosis. This review provides updates on the current state of surgery and radiotherapy for the treatment of brain metastases, as well as an overview of systemic therapy options that may be effective in select patients with intracranial metastases from lung cancer.

TI  - The utilization of immunotherapy with radiation therapy in lung cancer: a narrative review
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Despite decreasing smoking rates, lung cancer remains the leading cause of death from cancer in the United States. Radiation therapy has been established as an effective locoregional therapy for both early stage and locally advanced disease and is known to stimulate local immune response. Past treatment paradigms have established the role of combining cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens and radiation therapy to help address the local and systemic nature of lung cancer. However, these regimens have limitations in their tolerability due to toxicity. Additionally, cytotoxic chemotherapy has limited efficacy in preventing systemic spread of lung cancer. Newer systemic agents such as immune checkpoint inhibitors have shown improved survival in metastatic and locally advanced lung cancer and have the advantage of more limited toxicity profiles compared to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Furthermore, improved overall response rates and systemic tumor responses have been observed with the combination of radiation therapy and immunotherapy, leading to numerous active clinical trials evaluating the combination of immune checkpoint inhibition with radiotherapy. This comprehensive review discusses the current clinical data and ongoing studies evaluating the combination of radiation therapy and immunotherapy in both non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC).

TI  - Fraction Dose Escalation of Hypofractionated Radiotherapy with Concurrent Chemotherapy and Subsequent Consolidation Immunotherapy in Locally Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Phase I Study
T2  - CLINICAL CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: This phase I trial aimed to determine the maximum tolerated fraction dose (MTFD) of hypofractionated radiotherapy (hypo-RT) combined with concurrent chemotherapy and subsequent consolidation immune checkpoint inhibitors (cICI) for patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer.Patients and Methods: Split-course hypo-RT and hypoboost combined with concurrent chemotherapy was administered at three dose levels (DL), using a stepwise dose-escalation protocol. The sophisticated esophagus-sparing technique was implemented to restrict the dose to the esophagus. Patients who did not experience disease progression or unresolved >= grade 2 (G2+) toxicities after RT received cICI. Each DL aimed to treat six patients. The MTFD was defined as the highest DL at which <= 2 patients of the six who were treated experienced treatment-related G3+ toxicity and <= 1 patient experienced G4+ toxicity within 12 months post-RT.Results: Eighteen patients were enrolled, with six patients in each DL. All patients completed hypo-RT and concurrent chemotherapy, and 16 (88.9%) received at least one infusion of cICI, with a median of 10 infusions. Within the 12-month assessment period, one patient in DL1 experienced G3 pneumonitis, and one patient in DL3 developed G3 tracheobronchitis. The MTFD was not reached. The objective response rate was 100%. With a median follow-up of 20.9 months, the 1-year overall survival and progression-free survival rates were 94.4% and 83.3%, respectively.Conclusions: Utilizing the split-course hypo-RT and hypoboost approach, a fraction dose of 5 Gy to a total dose of 60 Gy, combined with concurrent chemotherapy and subsequent cICI, was well tolerated and yielded a promising objective response rate and survival outcomes.

TI  - Promising Combinatorial Therapeutic Strategies against Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Simple Summary Lung cancer treatment options vary depending on the type and stage of the cancer. For non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), treatments may include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, or a combination of these methods. Targeted therapies have demonstrated efficacy as adjuvant treatment in early-stage NSCLC when used alongside primary interventions such as surgery. In advanced stages of NSCLC, targeted therapies serve as a means of palliative care, enhancing quality of life and extending survival time. Our review article focuses on recent evidence of various treatment approaches and their impact on overall and progression-free survival in NSCLC patients, particularly targeting specific molecular and genetic alterations associated with NSCLC.Abstract Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) presents a complex and diverse disease, exhibiting variations at individuals' cellular and histological levels. This complexity gives rise to different subtypes and genetic mutations, posing challenges for accurate diagnosis and effective treatment. Nevertheless, continuous progress in medical research and therapies is continually shaping the landscape of NSCLC diagnosis and management. The treatment of NSCLC has undergone significant advancements in recent years, especially with the emergence of targeted therapies that have shown remarkable efficacy in patients with actionable mutations. This has ushered in the era of personalized medicine in NSCLC treatment, with improvements in molecular and immunohistochemical techniques contributing to enhanced progression-free survival. This review focuses on the latest progress, challenges, and future directions in developing targeted therapies for NSCLC, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), DNA-damaging agents, immunotherapy regimens, natural drug therapy, and nanobodies. Furthermore, recent randomized studies have demonstrated enhanced overall survival in patients receiving different targeted and natural drug therapies.

TI  - A phase II study of daily carboplatin plus irradiation followed by durvalumab for stage III non-small cell lung cancer patients with PS 2 up to 74years old and patients with PS 0 or 1 from 75years: NEJ039A (trial in progress)
T2  - BMC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Durvalumab is a standard drug used during maintenance therapy after chemoradiotherapy in patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC). However, little is known about the clinical benefits of durvalumab after chemoradiotherapy in patients with LA-NSCLC with a performance status (PS) of 2 and/or aged >75years. As daily carboplatin plus concurrent thoracic radiotherapy is recommended for elderly patients according to guideline, the current phase II study aims to investigate the effect of daily carboplatin plus radiotherapy followed by durvalumab for patients with stage III NSCLC who have a PS of 2 and/or are older.Methods: Daily carboplatin plus radiotherapy followed by durvalumab is performed for the patients with stage III NSCLC who have a PS of 2 and/or are older. This is a trial in progress manuscript.Study treatment: Daily, intravenous, low-dose carboplatin (30mg/m(2) in a 30-min infusion) is administered to patients 1h before radiotherapy for the first 20 fractions. Radiotherapy for all patients consisted of 60Gy administered as 30 fractions over 6weeks. Durvalumab at a dose of 10mg/kg/body is intravenously administered every 2weeks for up to 12months after chemoradiotherapy.Exploratory assessment: In the future, an exploratory investigation will be performed to determine whether the combined assessment of T-cell markers, PD-L1 expression, and tumor mutation burden could predict the outcomes of the regimen.Discussion: The results of our study will exhibit the efficacy and tolerability of durvalumab as maintenance therapy after daily carboplatin plus radiotherapy.Trial registration: During the first registration (before induction chemoradiotherapy), 70 patients will be included; then, we include 58 patients during the second registration (before durvalumab treatment after chemoradiotherapy). https://jcrb.niph.go.jp/.Primary endpoint: The primary endpoint of the current study is the 12-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate after the initiation of durvalumab.Secondary endpoints: The secondary endpoints are the feasibility, objective response, PFS, overall survival, and adverse events.

TI  - The Impact of Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation and Consolidative Thoracic Radiation Therapy for Extensive Stage Small-Cell Lung Cancer in the Transition to the Chemo-Immunotherapy Era: A Single Institution Series
T2  - CLINICAL LUNG CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - The role of consolidative thoracic radiation therapy (TRT) and prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in extensivestage small-cell lung cancer is a topic of controversy even in the current era. We report outcomes of PCI and TRT in 163 ES-SCLC patients from a single institution large database who completed chemotherapy with or without immunotherapy based on the appropriate standard of care at the time of the treatment. PCI was associated with improved overall survival and progression-free survival while thoracic radiation was not. In addition, older age and liver involvement were adverse prognostic factors. Introduction: Extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) continues to have poor survival due to its aggressive behavior, despite improvements with incorporation of immunotherapy with standard chemotherapy. Controversy exists regarding the role of consolidative thoracic radiation therapy (TRT) and prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in ES-SCLC due to high recurrence rates. We report our institutional result of the benefit of PCI and TRT in ES-SCLC. Methods: Patients with ES-SCLC without intracranial metastasis at diagnosis (N = 163) were included. All patients completed systemic therapy with or without immunotherapy based on time of standard of care. Cohorts were divided by systemic therapy use and further subdivided by treatment with PCI and TRT. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method with log-rank test for comparison. The effects of TRT and PCI were estimated by multivariable (MVA) Cox regression. Results: Seventy-four patients (45.4%) received TRT, and 33.1% (n = 54) received PCI. The median follow-up was 11 months (3-85 months). PCI improved median OS to 15 months from 10 months, P = .02) and median PFS to 8.5 months from 5 months ( P = .02) which remained significant on MVA, P = .02 and P = .02, respectively. TRT improved OS on UVA ( P = 0.002) but was not significant on MVA. TRT did not improve PFS. Conclusion: This study including chemotherapy and chemo-immunotherapy suggests improved outcomes with addition of PCI in patients with ES-SCLC while TRT did not show benefit to either OS or PFS. A future trial is needed to evaluate the role of TRT and PCI in the era of chemo-immunotherapy.

AB  - Locally advanced NSCLC is a complex, heterogeneous disease process that requires a thoughtful, multidisciplinary approach. In highly select patients with an excellent performance status and the absence of N2 disease, surgical resection of locally advanced and limited oligometastatic NSCLC offers a survival benefit when combined with a multimodal treatment strategy. With advancements in and the increasing application of immunotherapy, the multidisciplinary perspective of locally advanced NSCLC will continue to evolve.

TI  - Assessment of a Contralateral Esophagus-Sparing Technique in Locally Advanced Lung Cancer Treated With High-Dose Chemoradiation A Phase 1 Nonrandomized Clinical Trial
T2  - JAMA ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - IMPORTANCE Severe acute esophagitis occurs in up to 20% of patients with locally advanced lung cancer treated with chemoradiation therapy to at least 60 Gy once daily and represents a dose-limiting toxic event associated with poor outcomes.OBJECTIVE To assess whether formalized sparing of the contralateral esophagus (CE) is associated with reduced risk of severe acute esophagitis.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This single-center phase 1 nonrandomized clinical trial assessing an empirical CE-sparing technique enrolled patients from July 2015 to January 2019. In total, 27 patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma (with or without solitary brain metastasis) or limited-stage small cell lung carcinoma with gross tumor within 1 cmof the esophagus were eligible.INTERVENTIONS Intensity-modulated radiation therapy to 70 Gy at 2 Gy/fraction concurrent with standard chemotherapy with or without adjuvant durvalumab. The esophageal wall contralateral to gross tumor was contoured as an avoidance structure to guide a steep dose falloff gradient. Target coverage was prioritized over CE sparing, and 99% of internal and planning target volumes had to be covered by 70 Gy and at least 63 Gy, respectively.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary end point was the rate of at least grade 3 acute esophagitis as assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.RESULTS Of 27 patients enrolled, 25 completed chemoradiation therapy. Nineteen patients had non-small cell lung carcinoma, and 6 had small cell lung carcinoma. The median age at diagnosis was 67 years (range, 51-81 years), and 15 patients (60%) were men. Thirteen patients (52%) had stage IIIA cancer, 10 (40%) had stage IIIB cancer, and 2 (8%) had stage IV cancer. The median CE maximum dose was 66 Gy (range, 44-71 Gy); the median volume of CE receiving at least 55 Gy was 1.4 cm(3) (range, 0-5.3 cm(3)), and the median volume of CE receiving at least 45 Gy was 2.7 cm(3) (range, 0-9.2 cm(3)). The median combined percentage of lung receiving at least 20 Gy was 25%(range, 11%-37%). The median follow-up was 33.3 months (range, 11.1-52.2 months). Among the 20 patients who had treatment breaks of 0 to 3 days and were thus evaluable for the primary end point, the rate of at least grade 3 esophagitis was 0%. Other toxic events observed among all 25 patients included 7 (28%) with grade 2 esophagitis, 3 (12%) with at least grade 2 pneumonitis (including 1 with grade 5), and 2 (8%) with at least grade 3 cardiac toxic event (including 1 with grade 5). There was no isolated local tumor failure. The 2-year progression-free survival rate was 57%(95% CI, 33%-75%), and the 2-year overall survival rate was 67%(95% CI, 45%-82%).CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This phase 1 nonrandomized clinical trial found that the CE-sparing technique was associated with reduced risk of esophagitis among patients treated uniformly with chemoradiation therapy (to 70 Gy), with no grade 3 or higher esophagitis despite tumor within 1 cmof the esophagus. This technique may be translated into clinical practice.

CL  - HOUSTON, TX
AB  - Combined modality therapy for lung cancer was first demonstrated to be successful in limited-stage small cell lung cancer, Concurrent administration of chemotherapy with chest and elective brain irradiation appears to produce the best results, with cisplatin/etoposide as the core chemotherapy, Using such programs, 2-year survival in the 40% range and 5-year survivals in excess of 20% may be expected, based on the results of multiple studies, Attempts to improve on these results through the use of altered schemes of chest irradiation or the delivery of high-dose consolidation chemotherapy are ongoing but to date have not been shown to affect survival significantly, We remain at a plateau in the effectiveness of combined modality therapy for small cell lung cancer, with little evidence that it impacts survival at all in extensive-stage disease, The incorporation of new agents in combination chemotherapy regimens, more "specific" immunotherapy directed at tumor-associated antigens, and the potential adjunctive use of broad-spectrum neuropeptide antagonists offer promise for the future.In non-small cell lung cancer, the sequential use of platinum-based chemotherapy and chest irradiation appears superior in survival to standard, daily fractionated radiation therapy used alone, with long-term survival increased from 5-10% to 15-20%. Concurrent administration of chemotherapy with cisplatin/etoposide and chest irradiation produces 2-year survival in the range of 30%, about twice that would be expected for radiation therapy alone, but has not been compared to it in the setting of a randomized trial.Low-dose cisplatin on a daily basis has been combined as a "sensitizer" with chest irradiation, producing initial results that appeared encouraging, However, these have not been reproduced in subsequent, randomized trials.Another approach to combined modalities has been to give chemotherapy or chemotherapy/radiation therapy as induction, followed by surgical resection, with or without subsequent additional treatment, Most patients (80-85%) can be resected, with encouraging survival at 2 and 3 years in the Southwest Oncology Group experience (37 and 26%, respectively), However, toxicity is greater, and such an approach is associated with an overall mortality risk in the range of 10%, A current intergroup study attempts to define the role of surgery in this setting.The major recent development that is likely to influence the future of combined modality therapy for this disease is the advent of multiple new chemotherapeutic agents, such as the taxanes, gemcitabine, vinorelbine, and the topoisomerase-I inhibitors, which have activity in stage IV disease, The immediate challenge is how to combine these agents with platinum analogues, radiation, and surgery, Aiding this process may be the use of molecular biological "markers" that may predict the chance of success or failure with a given systemic agent. The next decade is likely to see substantial improvements in the outcome of treatment for patients with stages I-III non-small cell lung cancer, based on the systemic exploration of combined modalities.

TI  - Forthcoming Phase II Study of Durvalumab (MEDI4736) Plus Chemotherapy for Small Cell Lung Cancer with Brain Metastases
T2  - CANCER MANAGEMENT AND RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The standard of care for extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) is an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) combined with platinum-etoposide (PE) chemotherapy. At initial diagnosis, about 25% of ES-SCLC patients have brain metastases, which are associated with a poor prognosis. The decision as to whether to treat brain metastases with local therapies such as surgery or radiotherapy before initiation of systemic chemoimmunotherapy is based on symptoms due to the brain lesions and the general condition of the patient. Subset analysis of the CASPIAN study showed that combination therapy with PE plus durvalumab (MEDI4736) is promising for ES-SCLC with brain metastases. However, data required in daily clinical practice, such as intracranial response rate and duration of intracranial response, are insufficient for such patients. Patients and Methods: We have designed a single-arm phase II trial of durvalumab plus PE for patients aged >= 20 years with chemotherapy-naive ES-SCLC and at least one brain metastasis >= 5 mm in size that has not been previously treated. Patients receive durvalumab intravenously combined with four cycles of PE. Enrollment of 50 patients over 2 years at 25 oncology facilities in Japan is planned. The primary endpoint is intracranial response rate. Conclusion: This is the first prospective study to evaluate the effects of an ICI with PE specifically in ES-SCLC patients with brain metastases. If it demonstrates intracranial efficacy, this regimen will be a potential treatment option for such individuals, and radiation therapy or surgery for brain metastases can be avoided or postponed.

Prognosis, however, remains poor, and attempts to improve outcomes using consolidation or maintenance chemotherapy have not improved overall survival. Given the limited success of traditional cytotoxic chemotherapies as maintenance therapy for LA-NSCLC, recent studies have investigated the role of novel agents such as maintenance or consolidation, including antiangiogenic agents and molecular targeted therapy. With multiple newly reported trials demonstrating improved outcomes with immunotherapy over cytotoxic chemotherapy for stage IV NSCLC, integrating immunotherapy with definitive chemoradiation regimens or as consolidative therapy for LA-NSCLC is an attractive option. The recently published START trial is the first to test immunotherapy in LA-NSCLC in a randomized, phase III setting. In that trial, the administration of maintenance tecemotide (L-BLP25), which induces a T-cell response to the mucin 1 (MUC1) glycoprotein, was found to be well tolerated and improve overall survival compared with placebo among patients receiving concurrent, but not sequential, chemoradiation. Despite the promising findings of this trial, numerous questions regarding immunotherapy for LA-NSCLC remain, and several additional immunotherapy trials are underway or planned in this patient population.

M3  - Review
AB  - Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related death globally. In addition, its incidence increases with age, with approximately half of all cases diagnosed in patients aged >= 70. Molecular targeted therapies and immunotherapies for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer have markedly improved outcomes over the past two decades. Despite the high incidence of lung cancer in older people, most trials excluded such patients from enrollment. Therefore, the optimal treatment strategies for older patients remain unclear. The present review summarizes the published literature and provides guidance on the treatment of older patients with lung cancer within three broad stages: (i) early-stage lung cancer, (ii) locally advanced lung cancer and (iii) metastatic lung cancer. We also discuss the use of the latest evidence for older patients.The present review summarizes the published literature and provides guidance on the treatment of older patients with lung cancer based on the latest evidence.

M3  - Review
AB  - Lung cancer remains a leading cause of cancer related mortality worldwide. Despite numerous advances in treatments over the past decade, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains an incurable disease for most patients. The optimal treatment for all patients with locally advanced, but surgically resectable, NSCLC contains at least chemoradiation. Trimodality treatment with surgical resection has been a subject of debate for decades. For patients with unresectable or inoperable locally advanced disease, the incorporation of immunotherapy consolidation after chemoradiation has defined a new standard of care. For decades, the standard of care treatment for advanced stage NSCLC included only cytotoxic chemotherapy. However, with the introduction of targeted therapies and immunotherapy, the landscape of treatment has rapidly evolved. This review discusses the integration of these innovative therapies in the management of patients with newly diagnosed NSCLC.

T2  - DRUGS
M3  - Review
AB  - Small-cell lung cancer has defied our scientific community for decades. Chemotherapy has been the mainstay treatment for small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) and unlike its counterpart, non-small cell lung cancer, no significant therapeutic breakthroughs have been made since the 1970s. Among the reasons for this slow-paced therapeutic development, one that stands out is the distinctive and almost universal loss of function of the tumour suppressor genes TP53 and RB1 in this disease, for which pharmacological activation has yet to be achieved, despite having been highly sought after. Although no molecularly targeted approach has been approved for clinical practice thus far, several strategies are currently exploring the potential to drug the tumour's "Achilles heel" that stems from essential pathways regulating DNA-damage response. Most recently, we have witnessed newfound reasons to hope, as the combination of immunotherapy and systemic chemotherapy has improved survival outcomes, representing the first landmark achievement in decades and a new standard of care for patients with extensive disease SCLC. However, continuous efforts are still needed towards a better understanding of the molecular pathways that singularise this tumour to eventually identify the predictive biomarkers that might result in the development of a more rational therapeutic approach, including the use of immunotherapy combinations. In this review we aim to uncover critical aspects of the immune microenvironment and biology of SCLC and provide an overview of the current and future landscape of promising therapeutic opportunities. The challenge still stands, but regardless, we are living in exciting times to finally check SCLC off the "bucket list" of our scientific community.

AB  - At the meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO 2020), held this year virtually on May 29-31, investigators presented important practice changing findings in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In the early-stage resectable NSCLC, the key presentation was ADAURA study. This phase III clinical trial showed that the use of adjuvant osimertinib in stage IB-IIIA NSCLC patients harboring EGFR mutations had a clinically meaningful benefit. In locally advanced NSCLC, the recent studies investigated the role of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) administred early with or before concurrent chemoradiotherapy. In advanced-stage NSCLC with driver mutations, new targets and drugs were explored. The major step forward was the approval of personalized treatment in very uncommon genomic alterations, as RET fusions or MET mutations. In advanced NSCLC without targetable mutations, some new immunotherapy combination strategies have been presented. One of such combination was tiragolumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor binding to TIGIT, evaluated with atezolizumab. There were also data from the Checkmate 227 and Checkmate 9LA trials that led to recent approvals.

TI  - "Present and future of immunotherapy in Neuroendocrine Tumors"
T2  - REVIEWS IN ENDOCRINE & METABOLIC DISORDERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Immunotherapy, so promising in many neoplasms, still does not have a precise role in the treatment of neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs). In this article, we provide an overview on the current knowledge about immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) applied to NENs, evaluating future perspectives in this setting of tumors. Evidence so far available for ICIs in gastroenteropancreatic (GEP)-NENs is definitively not as robust as for other tumors such as Small Cell Lung Cancer or Merkel Cell Carcinoma. In fact, with regard to the well-differentiated forms of NENs (NETs), the results obtained nowadays have been disappointing. However, the near future, might reserve interesting results for ICIs in GEP-NEN from a total of nine different ICI drugs, used throughout 19 randomised controlled trials. Such numbers highlight the growing attention gathering around NENs and ICIs, in response to the need of stronger evidences supporting such therapy. For the future, the most important aspect will be to study strategies that can make NETs more susceptible to response to ICI and, thus, enhance the effectiveness of these treatments. Therefore, the combination of conventional therapy, target therapy and immunotherapy deserve attention and warrant to be explored. A sequential chemotherapy, possibly inducing an increase in tumor mutational burden and tested before immunotherapy, could be a hypothesis deserving more consideration. A radiation treatment that increases tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, could be another approach to explore before ICIs in NENs. Equally essential will be the identification of biomarkers useful for selecting patients potentially responsive to this type of treatment.

TI  - A Multicenter Study Assessing the Real-World Use and Effectiveness of First-Line Chemotherapy Plus Immunotherapy in Advanced Small-Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) Patients
T2  - CLINICAL LUNG CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: First-line chemotherapy plus immunotherapy (CT-IO) has recently demonstrated survival benefits over CT alone in extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC), based on randomized phase III studies. This retrospective multicenter study assessed the real-world use and effectiveness of CT-IO in ES-SCLC patients. Patients and Methods: All newly diagnosed ES-SCLC patients from 4 French hospitals treated with CT alone or CT-IO between May 2020 and December 2021 were included. Overall survival (OS) and real-world progression-free survival (rwPFS) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazard models were performed to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) in univariate and multivariate models. The aim was not to compare efficacy between groups. Results: Among 104 patients, 75 (72.1%) received CT-IO. Brain metastases were diagnosed in 28.3% of patients, and 29.8% were performance status (PS) >= 2. At a median follow-up of 16.8 months (95%CI, 14.9-23.4), the median OS was 11.4 months (95%CI, 7.7-14.7) in the CT-IO group, and the 12-month OS rate was 43.6% (95%CI, 33.3-57.2). In the CT group, the median OS was 7.8 months (95%CI, 5.4-11.8) and the 12-month OS rate was 15.3% (95%CI, 5.7-41.0). In multivariate analyses, baseline brain and liver metastases were associated with a shorter OS for patients treated in the CT-IO group (HR, 3.80 [95%CI, 1.90-7.60] and 3.12 [95%CI, 1.60-6.08] respectively; P < 0.001 for both). Conclusion: We showed that clinicians have chosen to use IO beyond the specific cr iter ia defined in guidelines. Survival data appeared promising with a median OS comparable to the one previously demonstrated in clinical trials.

TI  - Tumor microenvironment shows an immunological abscopal effect in patients with NSCLC treated with pembrolizumab-radiotherapy combination
T2  - JOURNAL FOR IMMUNOTHERAPY OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Immunotherapy is currently part of the standard of care for patients with advanced-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, many patients do not respond to this treatment, therefore combination strategies are being explored to increase clinical benefit. The PEMBRO-RT trial combined the therapeutic programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) antibody pembrolizumab with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) to increase the overall response rate and study the effects on the tumor microenvironment (TME). Methods Here, immune infiltrates in the TME of patients included in the PEMBRO-RT trial were investigated. Tumor biopsies of patients treated with pembrolizumab alone or combined with SBRT (a biopsy of the non-irradiated site) at baseline and during treatment were stained with multiplex immunofluorescence for CD3, CD8, CD20, CD103 and FoxP3 for lymphocytes, pan-cytokeratin for tumors, and HLA-ABC expression was determined. Results The total number of lymphocytes increased significantly after 6 weeks of treatment in the anti-PD-1 group (fold change: 1.87, 95% CI: 1.06 to 3.29) and the anti-PD-1+SBRT group (fold change: 2.29, 95% CI: 1.46 to 3.60). The combination of SBRT and anti-PD-1 induced a 4.87-fold increase (95% CI: 2.45 to 9.68) in CD103(+) cytotoxic T-cells 6 weeks on treatment and a 2.56-fold increase (95% CI: 1.03 to 6.36) after anti-PD-1 therapy alone. Responders had a significantly higher number of lymphocytes at baseline than non-responders (fold difference 1.85, 95% CI: 1.04 to 3.29 for anti-PD-1 and fold change 1.93, 95% CI: 1.08 to 3.44 for anti-PD-1+SBRT). Conclusion This explorative study shows that that lymphocyte infiltration in general, instead of the infiltration of a specific lymphocyte subset, is associated with response to therapy in patients with NSCLC. Furthermore, anti-PD-1+SBRT combination therapy induces an immunological abscopal effect in the TME represented by a superior infiltration of cytotoxic T cells as compared with anti-PD-1 monotherapy.

TI  - The effects of radiotherapy on the survival of patients with unresectable non-small cell lung cancer
T2  - EXPERT REVIEW OF ANTICANCER THERAPY
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction: Lung cancer represents the leading cause of cancer mortality across the worlds. At present, less than 30% of the patients can undergo curative surgery, while the majority of them (65%) are diagnosed with metastatic disease and directed to systemic treatments. In this context there is a subset of patients (25%) with locally advanced stage disease whose outcome might be improved by using combined strategies of treatment including chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery.Areas covered: Here we reviewed possible combination strategies aimed to improve the outcome of lung cancer patients, focusing on the role of radiotherapy both in the adjuvant and oligo-metastatic setting and in synergy with immunotherapy, and finally, we afforded the new challenges concerning the advanced RT and precision oncology. We carried out a focused analysis concerning the key clinical management weaknesses as well as the potential that current research holds.Expert commentary: We believe that the most promising clinical trials in this specific patient subset will build their rationale on the results of well-designed translational models aimed to test the combination of cytotoxic drugs, radiobiology, and immune-pharmacology. In this context, remarkable investigational fields are focused on the attempt to combine radiotherapy with chemo-immunological strategies and precision medicine protocols.

TI  - Targeted therapy of brain metastases: latest evidence and clinical implications
T2  - THERAPEUTIC ADVANCES IN MEDICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Brain metastases (BM) occur in 20-40% of patients with cancer and 60-75% of patients with BM become symptomatic. Due to an aging population and advances in the treatment of primary cancers, patients are living longer and are more likely to experience complications from BM. The diagnosis of BM drastically worsens long-term survival rates, with multiple metastases being a poor prognostic factor. Until recently, the mainstay of treatment consisted of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), surgical resection, whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT), or a combination of these modalities. Systemic chemotherapy has been felt largely ineffective in the treatment of BM due to the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which includes efflux pumps on brain capillaries. Over the past decade however, researchers have identified therapeutic agents that are able to cross the BBB. These findings could make a multimodality treatment approach possible, consisting of surgery, radiation, immunotherapy, and targeted therapy, which could lead to better disease control in this patient population and prolong survival. In this review, we discuss present evidence on available targeted therapies and their role in the treatment of BM from primary tumors with the highest prevalence of central nervous system (CNS) involvement, specifically non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), breast cancer melanoma, and renal cell carcinoma.

TI  - Sintilimab, stereotactic body radiotherapy and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor as second-line therapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer: safety run-in results of a multicenter, single-arm, phase II trial
T2  - RADIATION ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives The SWORD trial is the first multicenter, single arm, phase II study assessing the safety and efficacy of a PD-1 inhibitor (Sintilimab), stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) without sensitizing driver mutations. A safety run-in phase was conducted to determine the tolerability of the experimental treatment. Materials and methods Twenty metastatic NSCLC patients who failed first-line chemotherapy were enrolled, and they received SBRT (8 Gy x 3) to one lesion, followed by Sintilimab (200 mg d1, every 3 weeks, until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 35 cycles) and GM-CSF (125 mu g/m(2) d1-d14, cycle 1) within 2 weeks after SBRT. In addition, blood and tissue samples were serially collected for translational research. Results Median age of the patients was 61 and all of them had more than 5 lesions at baseline. The sites of SBRT included lung (n = 11), mediastinal lymph node (n = 5), liver (n = 1), abdominal lymph node (n = 1), pleural nodule (n = 1) and vertebra (n = 1). No patients had dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and 18 patients experienced treatment-related adverse event (TRAE). The most common TRAEs were fatigue (50%), fever (30%), and ostealgia (20%), and they all were grade 1. Only 2 grade 3 TRAEs were observed, including elevation of liver enzymes in one and transient acute heart failure in another. No grade 4 or 5 AE was observed. Conclusion Sintilimab, SBRT and GM-CSF for advanced NSCLC is safe with manageable TRAEs and the trial continues to recruit participants. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04106180.

TI  - Locally advanced NSCLC: a plea for sparing the ipsilateral normal lung-prospective, clinical trial with DART-bid (dose-differentiated accelerated radiation therapy, 1.8 Gy twice daily) by VMAT
T2  - RADIATION ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: In radiation treatment of locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC), 'margins' from internal target volumes to planning target volumes in the range of 12 to 23 mm are reported, and avoiding exposure of the contralateral lung is common practice. We investigated prospectively an approach with tight margins (7 mm) and maximal sparing of the ipsilateral normal lung. Mature results for the first endpoint (pneumonitis) and further toxicities are reported.Methods: Primary tumors were treated by VMAT with 73.8-90.0 Gy in positive correlation to tumor volumes, nodes with 61.2 Gy, a restricted volume of nodes electively with 45 Gy. Fractional doses of 1.8 Gy bid, interval 8 h. Before radiotherapy, two cycles platin-based chemotherapy were given. 12 patients finished maintenance therapy with Durvalumab. Median follow up time for all patients is 19.4 months, for patients alive 27.0 months (3.4-66.5 months).Results: 100 consecutive, unselected patients with LA-NSCLC in stages II through IVA were enrolled (UICC/AJCC, 8th edition). No acute grade 4/5 toxicity occurred. Pneumonitis grade 2 and 3 was observed in 12% and 2% of patients, respectively; lowering the risk of pneumonitis grade >= 2 in comparison to the largest study in the literature investigating pneumonitis in LA-NSCLC, is significant (p < 0.0006). Acute esophageal toxicity grade 1, 2 and 3 occurred in 12%, 57% and 3% of patients, respectively. Two patients showed late bronchial stricture/atelectasis grade 2. In two patients with lethal pulmonary haemorrhages a treatment correlation cannot be excluded. Median overall survival for all stage III patients, and for those with 'RTOG 0617 inclusion criteria' is 46.6 and 50.0 months, respectively.Conclusions: Overall toxicity is low. In comparison to results in the literature, maximal sparing the ipsilateral normal lung lowers the risk for pneumonitis significantly.

TI  - Radiotherapy is an independent prognostic marker of favorable prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer patients after treatment with the immune checkpoint inhibitor, nivolumab
T2  - THORACIC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundIt remains unclear why radiation clinically provides a synergistic effect when combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors such as nivolumab. The purpose of our study was to retrospectively evaluate whether the therapeutic efficacy of nivolumab is improved as a result of a history of radiotherapy (RT) in patients with previously treated advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).MethodsFrom February 2016 to December 2017, 124 consecutive patients were administered nivolumab for pretreated advanced NSCLC. The patients were divided into RT and non-RT groups.ResultsSixty-six (53%) of the 124 patients had been administered RT before the initiation of nivolumab, 52 (42%) received extracranial RT, and 40 (32%) were treated with thoracic RT. The median number of nivolumab cycles was 4 (range: 1-43). The overall response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) of nivolumab in all patients were 28.0% and 58.4%, respectively. The ORR (36.4%) was significantly higher in patients who had received previous RT than in patients who had not received any RT (19%). The therapeutic efficacy of nivolumab was particularly noteworthy in patients with non-adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma histology administered extracranial RT, with ORRs of 48.3% and 52.6%, and DCRs of 87.1% and 84.2%, respectively.ConclusionPrevious RT was an independent prognostic marker of favorable prognosis after nivolumab administration and improved the response rate to nivolumab treatment. Previous RT was clinically identified to have a synergistic effect with nivolumab treatment, increasing the response rate and improving the outcome of patients with advanced NSCLC.

TI  - ImmunoChemoradiation for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Meta-Analysis of Factors Influencing fl uencing Survival Benefit fi t in Combination Trials
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION ONCOLOGY BIOLOGY PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Adding immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) to concurrent chemoradiotherapy (cCRT) has improved overall survival (OS) for inoperable locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Trials of cCRT-ICB are heterogeneous for factors such as tumor stage and histology, programmed cell death ligand-1 (PDL-1) status, and cCRT-ICB schedules. We therefore aimed to determine the ICB contribution to survival across studies and identify factors associated with survival gain. Methods and Materials: Data were collated from cCRT-ICB clinical studies published 2018 to 2022 that treated 2196 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (99% stage 3). Associations between 2-year OS and ICB, CRT, patient and tumor factors were investigated using metaregression. A published model of survival after radiation therapy (RT) or CRT was extended to include ICB effects. The model was fi tted simultaneously to the cCRT-ICB data and data previously compiled for RT/CRT treatments alone. The net ICB contribution (OS gain) and its associations with factors were described by fi tted values of ICB terms added to the model. Statistical significance fi cance was determined by likelihood-ratio testing. Results: The gain in 2-year OS from ICB was 9.9% overall (95% CI, 7.6%, 12.2%; P = .018). Both OS gain and 2-year OS itself rose with increasing planned ICB duration (P = .008, .002, respectively) and with tumor PDL-1 >= 1% (P = .034, .023). Fitted OS gains were also greater for patients with stage 3B/C disease (P = .021). OS gain was not associated with tumor histology, patient performance status, radiation therapy dose, ICB drug type (anti-PDL-1 vs anti-programmed cell death-1), or whether ICB began concurrently with or after cCRT. Conclusions: Fitted gains in 2-year OS due to ICB were higher in cohorts with greater fractions of stage 3B/C patients and patients with tumor PDL-1 > 1%. OS gain was also significantly fi cantly higher in a single cohort with a planned ICB duration of 2 years rather than 1, but was not associated with whether ICB treatment began during versus after CRT.

TI  - Palliative extracranial radiotherapy in patients receiving immunotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer: a narrative review
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Background and Objective: Role of radiotherapy (RT) in the era of immuno-oncology (IO) in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is rapidly changing. RT is not only intended for addressing palliation symptoms but also is considered as a potential tool potentializing an immunogenic effect of given drugs. However, the best timing, techniques, doses, volumes, and its use for asymptomatic patients is a subject of research. We performed a review on the role of palliative RT schedules in combination with IO for advanced NSCLC. Indications in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, outcomes, toxicity, and possible developments are discussed.Methods: A literature search was conducted in MEDLINE and PubMed databases and clinicaltrials.gov using the keywords 'lung cancer' AND "immunotherapy" AND 'radiotherapy' OR "palliative radiotherapy".Key Content and Findings: Body of evidence indicate that palliative RT used in combination with IO is effective in terms of symptom management and safe; does not increase the risk of serious side effects, including serious pulmonary toxicity. We have limited data evidencing improvement of survival by addition of short ablative RT dose to one site of the disease to IO in oligometastatic NSCLC. Some data indicate that short ablative doses of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) are more effective with regard to treatment response and survival than protracted RT schedule with lower fractional doses. However, this may be a selection bias of better prognostic patients who underwent SBRT. The use of steroids being a potential concern during IO should not be prohibited if clinically indicated during palliative RT. Its detrimental effect shown in some studies may also be a result of selection bias, because steroids given for not cancer-related causes during IO did not decrease survival.Conclusions: RT for symptom management may be used during, directly before or after IO. This has a potential to ease symptom burdens and improve performance status ( PS). However, still more studies are needed to establish optimal guidelines in asymptomatic patients for appropriate timing, volumes, dose, and fractionation schedules of palliative RT use in combination with IO.

TI  - ROLE OF SMAC IN LUNG CARCINOGENESIS AND THERAPY
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - Background:  Localized advanced and metastatic non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) are treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy.  However, resistance to standard therapy has been a major challenge in curing these patients.  Combining immunotherapy and radiotherapy can rescue therapeutic immunity against lung cancer as recent clinical trials utilizing immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti-CTLA4 or anti-PD-1, have yielded impressive responses in lung cancer patients.  In this case, the release of cancer antigens following radiotherapy may synergize in the induction of cancer-specific immune responses, which impact distant metastases.  While confirming the merit of this approach, clinical trials have documented that only 20%-30% of patients with NSCLC responded to PD-1 inhibitors, highlighting the need for alternative approaches to improve the outcome, particularly for poor responders to PD1 inhibitors.  As the leader for the lung cancer working group through the National Cancer Institute radiation research branch, we intend to promote the development of novel therapeutics to be combined with radiotherapy.  In this proposal, we show preliminary data that the combined use of a SMAC mimetic and radiotherapy results in therapeutic synergism in a lung cancer model through a CD8-dependent mechanism.  We propose to extend this work by determining the role of SMAC in lung cancer progression and its resistance to therapy.  We will also determine immunological mechanism by which combining a SMAC mimetic and radiotherapy yields therapeutic synergy and whether and how this combination yields abscopal effects from radiotherapy in our lung cancer model.Objectives/Hypothesis:  An active host immune system can deter cancer progression and enhance the efficacy of cytotoxic cancer therapy.  We are encouraged by our preliminary data showing that Smac mimetics and radiotherapy activate host immune system and synergize the therapeutic effect in a CD8+ lymphocyte-dependent manner.  We hypothesize that Smac modulates both lung carcinogenesis and subsequent therapeutic response to chemotherapy and radiotherapy.  Furthermore, we hypothesize that combining a Smac mimetic with SBRT induces abscopal effect.  We will test these hypotheses in part through the generation of a novel transgenic mouse model, in the following specific aims.Specific Aims:  (1) Determine the role of Smac in carcinogenesis and therapeutic response of lung cancer.  (2) Determine the abscopal effect and optimize the therapeutic ratio of combining a SMAC mimetics and Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) in mouse models of lung cancer.Study Design:  In Aim 1, we will generate a mouse model that develops Kras-G12D driven lung cancer on a Smac null background.  To do so, we will cross Kras-G12D transgenic mice with Smac-/- mice.  The resulting Kras-G12D+/- Smac-/-mice will allow us to determine whether the loss of Smac alters lung cancer progression by escaping immune surveillance and determine whether it alters therapeutic response to cisplatin (CDDP).  Our Aim 2 is based on our previous demonstration of radiosensitizing-property of a SMAC mimetic, Debio1143, in human lung cancer cell models.  As shown in our preliminary data, combination of Debio1143 with radiotherapy generates synergistic anti-tumor effects in a CD8+ T cell-dependent manner.  We will test the hypothesis that combining SBRT and Debio1143 induces abscopal effects, likely mediated by effective induction of tumor immunity including tumor-specific cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTL), the eradication of residual irradiated tumors, as well as an abscopal effect on non-irradiated distant disease.  We will test this hypothesis using the transgenic model generated in the Aim 1.Innovation:  The proposed study investigates a novel therapeutic approach of combining a SMAC mimetic and radiotherapy in inducing host immune response again lung cancer.  This study will be conducted through utilization of an image-guided mouse irradiator and novel mouse lung cancer model with and without SMAC.Impact:  By investigating a novel approach of activating host immune response against lung cancer, we aim to eradicate deaths from lung cancer.Relevance:  This project will investigate whether SMAC mediates lung cancer progression and aims to eliminate lung cancer resistance to standard therapy by activate host immune system.  Outcomes of this project may benefit military Service members, Veterans, and their families, who suffer from lung cancer.

AB  - The standard treatment for limited-stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is concurrent chemoradiation, with a small subset of patients that could potentially benefit from surgery. For extensive-stage SCLC, the current standard of care is chemoimmunotherapy with a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor. The role of prophylactic cranial irradiation in SCLC is currently under debate, and is being investigated in the ongoing MAVERICK trial. Despite high initial response rates to chemoradiotherapy, relapse is common, and outcomes for these patients remain poor. However, recent advances in understanding the molecular biology of SCLC have led to the identification of potential new targets for treatment, including the combination of temozolomide with PARP inhibitors and DLL3-targeted bispecific T-cell engager therapy, both of which have shown activity in early studies.

T2  - EXPERT REVIEW OF RESPIRATORY MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction: Cancer immunotherapy represents a major therapeutic breakthrough. Immune checkpoint inhibitors alone or in the context of a combination are considered the new standard of care in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Areas covered: This review explains the biologic rationale behind the implementation of immune checkpoint inhibitors for the therapy of advanced NSCLC. It provides a detailed description of the clinical trials that have studied the various agents now in use and the results that lead to the currently approved indications. It also explores the area of established and developing biomarkers, and the trends of combining immunotherapy with other treatment modalities (chemotherapy, antiangiogenic agents, radiotherapy), or with other immune modulators. Expert opinion: Immune checkpoint inhibitors have been established as the new standard of care for patients with advanced NSCLC. They can be administered according to PD-L1 expression upfront as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy- regardless of PD-L1 status - or in the later lines of therapy. They also represent a less toxic and more effective treatment choice than chemotherapy alone. The development of reliable biomarkers for patient selection and the subsequent use of the appropriate immune-based approach for each patient will define the role of immunotherapy in the years to come.

TI  - The Significance of the PD-L1 Expression in Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer: Trenchant Double Swords as Predictive and Prognostic Markers
T2  - CLINICAL LUNG CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - Lung cancer is the leading cause of death due to cancer worldwide. Surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy have been the standard treatment for lung cancer, and targeted molecular therapy has greatly improved the clinical course of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring driver mutations, such as in epidermal growth factor receptor and anaplastic lymphoma kinase genes. Despite advances in such therapies, the prognosis of patients with NSCLC without driver oncogene mutations remains poor. Immunotherapy targeting programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) has recently been shown to improve the survival in advanced NSCLC. The PD-L1 expression on the surface of tumor cells has emerged as a potential biomarker for predicting responses to immunotherapy and prognosis after surgery in NSCLC. However, the utility of PD-L1 expression as a predictive and prognostic biomarker remains controversial because of the existence of various PD-L1 antibodies, scoring systems, and positivity cutoffs. In this review, we summarize the data from representative clinical trials of PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors in NSCLC and previous reports on the association between PD-L1 expression and clinical outcomes in patients with NSCLC. Furthermore, we discuss the future perspectives of immunotherapy and immune checkpoint factors. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Treatment Design and Rationale for a Randomized Trial of Cisplatin and Etoposide Plus Thoracic Radiotherapy Followed by Nivolumab or Placebo for Locally Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (RTOG 3505)
T2  - CLINICAL LUNG CANCER
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 3505 is a randomized phase 3 study of concurrent chemoradiation followed by immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy or placebo in patients with locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients with surgically unresectable stage 3 NSCLC will receive thoracic radiotherapy to 60 Gy with concurrent cisplatin 50 mg/m(2) intravenously (I. V.) on days 1, 8, 29, and 36, and etoposide 50 mg/m(2) I. V. on days 1 to 5 and days 29 to 33. Between 4 and 12 weeks after completion of concurrent chemoradiation, eligible patients will be randomized to the anti-programmed death 1 (PD-1) monoclonal antibody nivolumab 240 mg I. V. or placebo every 2 weeks for up to 1 year. The primary end points are overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), as determined by central independent radiology review. Secondary objectives include toxicity assessment, patient-reported outcomes and quality of life, and OS and PFS in programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expressors (>= 1%) and PD-L1 nonexpressors (< 1%). Assuming a rate of 16.7% due to ineligibility and dropout before randomization, a total of 660 patients will be enrolled to ensure 550 patients will be randomized after completion of chemoradiation. This sample size will provide >= 90% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.7 for OS with 2-sided type I error of 0.04, and to detect a hazard ratio of 0.667 for PFS 2-sided type I error of 0.01.

TI  - Update on adjuvant therapy in completely resected NSCLC patients
T2  - THORACIC CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - In patients with completely resected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy has been associated with improvement in survival by minimizing the risk of recurrence. For years, systemic chemotherapy including platinum based regimen has been a mainstay treatment modality of adjuvant treatment after complete resection. ADAURA study showed that among completely resected IB to IIIA NSCLC, disease-free survival was significantly better in patients under adjuvant osimertinib than a placebo group. After the advent of a variety of new treatment regimens, such as third generation TKI and immunotherapy, the landscape of postoperative adjuvant treatment has been changing. In this review, we discuss some key issues regarding choice of adjuvant treatment after complete resection in NSCLC, and provide further updates on recent advances in treatment modalities.

TI  - Durvalumab, with or without tremelimumab, plus platinum-etoposide versus platinum-etoposide alone in first-line treatment of extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (CASPIAN): updated results from a randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 3 trial
T2  - LANCET ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background First-line durvalumab plus etoposide with either cisplatin or carboplatin (platinum-etoposide) showed a significant improvement in overall survival versus platinum-etoposide alone in patients with extensive-stage smallcell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) in the CASPIAN study. Here we report updated results, including the primary analysis for overall survival with durvalumab plus tremelimumab plus platinum-etoposide versus platinum-etoposide alone.Methods CASPIAN is an ongoing, open-label, sponsor-blind, randomised, controlled phase 3 trial at 209 cancer treatment centres in 23 countries worldwide. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older (20 years in Japan) and had treatment-naive, histologically or cytologically documented ES-SCLC, with a WHO performance status of 0 or 1. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) in blocks of six, stratified by planned platinum, using an interactive voice-response or web-response system to receive intravenous dunraluinab plus tremeliinuinab plus platinum-etoposide, durvalumab plus platinum-etoposide, or platinum-etoposide alone. In all groups, patients received etoposide 80-100 mg/m(2) on days 1-3 of each cycle with investigator's choice of either carboplatin area under the curve 5-6 rng/rnL/min or cisplatin 75-80 mg/m(2) on day 1 of each cycle. Patients in the platinum-etoposide group received up to six cycles of platinum-etoposide every 3 weeks and optional prophylactic cranial irradiation (investigator's discretion). Patients in the immunotherapy groups received four cycles of platinum-etoposide plus durvalumab 1500 mg with or without tremelimumab 75 mg every 3 weeks followed by maintenance durvalumab 1500 mg every 4 weeks. The two primary endpoints were overall survival for durvalumab plus platinum-etoposide versus platinum-etoposide and for durvalumab plus tremelimumab plus platinum-etoposide versus platinum- etoposide in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03043872.Findings Between March 27,2017, and May 29,2018,972 patients were screened and 805 were randomly assigned (268 to durvalumab plus tremelimumab plus platinum-etoposide, 268 to durvalumab plus platinum-etoposide, and 269 to platinum-etoposide). As of Jan 27, 2020, the median follow-up was 25.1 months (IQR 22.3-27.9). Durvalumab plus treinelimuinab plus platinurn-etoposide was not associated with a significant improvement in overall survival versus platinum-etoposide (hazard ratio [HR] 0.82 [95% CI 0.68-1-00]; p=0.045); median overall survival was 10.4 months (95% CI 9.6-12.0) versus 10.5 months (9.3-11.2). Durvalumab plus platinum-etoposide showed sustained improvement in overall survival versus platinum-etoposide (HR 0.75 [95% CI 0-62-0.91]; nominal p=0.0032); median overall survival was 12.9 months (95% CI 11.3-14.7) versus 10.5 months (9.3-11.2). The most common any-cause grade 3 or worse adverse events were neutropenia (85 [32%] of 266 patients in the durvalumab plus tremelimumab plus platinum-etoposide group, 64 [24%] of 265 patients in the durvalumab plus platinum-etoposide group, and 88 [33%] of 266 patients in the platinum-etoposide group) and anaemia (34[13%], 24[9%], and 48 [18%]). Any-cause serious adverse events were reported in 121 (45%) patients in the durvalumab plus tremelimumab plus platinum-etoposide group, 85 (32%) in the durvalumab plus platinum-etoposide group, and 97 (36%) in the platinum-etoposide group. Treatment-related deaths occurred in 12 (5%) patients in the durvalumab plus tremeliinumab plus platinum-etoposide group (death, febrile neutropenia, and pulmonary embolism [n=2 each]; enterocolitis, general physical health deterioration and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, pneumonia, pneumonitis and hepatitis, respiratory failure, and sudden death [n=1 each]), six (2%) patients in the durvalumab plus platinum-etoposide group (cardiac arrest, dehydration, hepatotoxicity, interstitial lung disease, pancytopenia, and sepsis In=1 each]), and two (1%) in the platinum-etoposide group pancytopenia and thrombocytopenia [n=1 each]).Interpretation First-line durvalumab plus platinum-etoposide showed sustained overall survival improvement versus platinum-etoposide but the addition of tremelimumab to durvalumab plus platinurn-etoposide did not significantly improve outcomes versus platinum-etoposide. These results support the use of durvarlumab plus platinum-etoposide as a new standard of care for the first-line treatment of ES-SCLC. Copyright (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Real world data of durvalumab consolidation after chemoradiotherapy in stage III non-small-cell lung cancer
T2  - LUNG CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: The PACIFIC study demonstrated the benefits of durvalumab consolidation on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) among patients with unresectable locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC). However, in real-world practice, patients with unresectable LA-NSCLC are heterogeneous with diverse tumor burdens and clinical factors; thus, it is important to examine the effectiveness and side effects of durvalumab when used in real clinical practice.Materials and methods: We investigated the efficacy of durvalumab consolidation and the incidence of radiation pneumonitis in patients who received concurrent chemo-radiotherapy (CCRT) for unresectable LA-NSCLC in a single institute.Results: Overall, 55.3 % of patients did not meet the criteria of the PACIFIC study; however, they still received consolidation durvalumab in real-world practice. Durvalumab consolidation was associated with favorable PFS in the total population as well as in the subgroup of patients who did not meet the criteria of the PACIFIC study. However, radiation pneumonitis occurred more frequently in the durvalumab group, especially within 3-6 months after CCRT. The incidence of grade 3 radiation pneumonitis was 14.3 % in the durvalumab group versus 2.5 % in the observation group.yConclusions: Durvalumab consolidation was associated with favorable PFS in patients with LA-NSCLC in clinical practice. However, careful selection of candidates for durvalumab treatment and active surveillance and appropriate management for radiation pneumonitis are needed.

TI  - Prognostic factors for survival in extensive-stage small cell lung cancer: An Italian real-world retrospective analysis of 244 patients treated over the last decade
T2  - THORACIC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Potential relationships with the prognosis of patients with extensive-stage non-small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) have been investigated without valid results. Methods A retrospective analysis of real-world data of consecutive patients with ES-SCLC admitted to our Medical Thoracic Oncology Unit was carried out from 2010 to 2020, focusing on identification of prognostic factors. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to represent progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Univariable and multivariable Cox models were used to investigate prognostic factors. Results The analysis included 244 patients. The median OS was 8 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 8-10) and the median PFS was 5 months (95% CI: 5-6). The univariable analysis showed that factors associated with shorter OS were older age (p = 0.047), TNM stage 4 versus 3 (p < 0.001), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 1 and 2 versus 0 (p < 0.001), and >2 metastatic sites (p = 0.004). Mediastinal radiotherapy (RT) (p < 0.001), >1 irradiated site (p = 0.026), 3 and 4 chemotherapy (CT) lines versus 1 (p = 0.044 and 0.001, respectively), prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) (p < 0.001), and surgery (p = 0.001) correlated with longer OS. The multivariable analysis revealed statistically significant associations for TNM, ECOG PS 2 versus 0, number of CT lines, PCI, and surgery. A total of 23 patients (9.4%) survived >= 24 months, 39% of whom had received four CT lines and 48% had mediastinal RT. Conclusions Our data suggest that tumor burden, PS, and mediastinal RT strongly correlate with outcome. With the addition of immunotherapy to CT, the identification of new biomarkers as predictive factors is urgently required.

TI  - First-Line Treatment for Advanced SCLC: What Is Left Behind and Beyond Chemoimmunotherapy
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is still a lethal disease. Three phase III randomized clinical trials (IMpower133, CASPIAN, and KEYNOTE-604) have highlighted the survival gain of adding immune checkpoint inhibitors to first-line standard chemotherapy in advanced SCLC patients. In this review, we discuss the data from the three trials above. Furtherly, we analyze issues that still need to be elucidated, like the role of biomarkers, poor performance status at baseline, the presence of brain metastases, and the platinum compound's choice. Moreover, we depict the future of SCLC first-line therapy management, focusing on new therapeutic strategies currently under investigation.

TI  - Immune-checkpoint inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer: A tool to improve patients' selection
T2  - CRITICAL REVIEWS IN ONCOLOGY HEMATOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The identification of reliable predictive biomarkers of efficacy or resistance to immune-oncology (I-O) agents is a major issue for translational research and clinical practice. However, along with PDL1 and molecular features other clinical, radiological and laboratory factors can be considered for the selection of those patients who would not be the best candidate for immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICPIs). We examined these factors, emerging from the results of currently available studies in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), aiming to provide a useful and manageable tool which can help Oncologists in their everyday clinical practice.A thorough patient evaluation and close clinical monitoring, due to limited, early or inconclusive currently available data, should be deserved for patients with a pre-existing symptomatic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, age > 75 years, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 1, a time to progression (TTP) < three months and progressive disease (PD) as the best response to the previous treatment, hepatitis or HIV-infections, high neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), or on treatment with high-dose steroids, when the use of ICPIs is considered. Limited data are available to consider that ICPIs are safe in patients with interstitial lung disease, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia and autommune diseases. Early evidence on steroids, vaccinations and antibiotics suggest their possible interaction with ICPIs and need to be more investigated in clinical trials. Oncogene-addicted NSCLC harboring EGFR-mutations and low tumor-infiltrating T-lymphocytes (TILs) seems not to gain benefit from I-O.

M3  - Review
AB  - Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for 13% of all lung tumors. The standard treatment in patients with limited-stage (LS) disease is thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) combined with chemotherapy. In extensive-stage (ES) SCLC, the importance of consolidation TRT in patients with a good treatment response has become increasingly recognized. In both LS and ES disease, prophylactic cranial irradiation is recommended in patients who respond to treatment. New therapeutic approaches such as immunotherapy are being increasingly incorporated into the treatment of SCLC, although more slowly than in non-small cell lung cancer. Diverse radiation dose and fractionation schemes, administered in varying combinations with these new drugs, are being investigated. In the present article, we review and update the role of radiotherapy in the treatment of SCLC. We also discuss the main clinical trials currently underway to identify future trends.RELEVANCE FOR PATIENTS: Radiotherapy is a critical component of multimodality treatment of SCLC. This article can help physicians to improve medical knowledge and find better ways to treat their SCLC patients.

TI  - The Role of Immunotherapy or Immuno-Chemotherapy in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Comprehensive Review
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Many new treatment modalities for non-small-cell carcinoma (NSCLC) have been described in the last two decades. Surgical resections remain the gold standard for early stages and may be considered for locally advanced tumors. Medical treatment has changed drastically in recent years, especially for advanced stages, for which the development of immunotherapy and molecular targeted therapy significantly increased survival and quality of life. The addition of radical surgical resection following immunotherapy or immuno-chemotherapy is feasible and safe with low surgical-related mortality and morbidity in selected patients with initially unresectable NSCLC. However, data from multiple ongoing trials with overall survival as the primary endpoint should be awaited before this strategy is introduced into the standard of care.

TI  - Adoptive immunotherapy combined chemoradiotherapy for non-small-cell lung cancer: a meta-analysis
T2  - ANTI-CANCER DRUGS
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare the efficacies between adoptive immunotherapy combined chemoradiotherapy and chemoradiotherapy alone in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The databases PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane database were searched to identify eligible clinical trials. Data analyses were carried out using a comprehensive meta-analysis program, version 2 software. A total of seven articles were finally included in the analysis. Meta-analyses showed that compared with chemoradiotherapy alone, adoptive immunotherapy combined with chemoradiotherapy could improve the 2-year overall survival [odds ratio (OR)=2.45, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.60-3.75, P<0.001], but not 2-year progression-free survival (OR=1.81, 95% CI: 0.61-5.36, P=0.284). Specifically, early (OR=3.32, 95% CI: 1.38-7.95, P<0.01) but not advanced (OR=3.75, 95% CI: 0.96-14.68, P=0.057) NSCLC patients were likely to gain a large benefit from the adoptive immunotherapy. Most of the adoptive immunotherapy-induced adverse effects were self-limited, mainly including fever, shiver, nausea, fatigue, etc. and severe toxicities were not observed. Adoptive immunotherapy combined with chemoradiotherapy can delay the recurrence of NSCLC and improve survival in patients, where the benefits are even more significant in patients with early-stage NSCLC.

TI  - Robust response of pulmonary pleomorphic carcinoma to pembrolizumab and sequential radiotherapy: A case report
T2  - RESPIROLOGY CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Pulmonary pleomorphic carcinoma (PPC) is a rare type of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with a more aggressive clinical course and a worse outcome than other types of NSCLC. Pembrolizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting programmed cell death-1 (PD-1), has been approved as the first-line treatment for advanced NSCLC with robust PD-L1 expression in at least 50% of tumour cells, without epidermal growth factor receptor gene (EGFR) mutations or anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene (ALK) rearrangement. Here, we report the case of an 81-year-old man with multiple comorbidities who was diagnosed with PPC and showed a robust response to pembrolizumab followed by radiation therapy without adverse effects. In the absence of randomized clinical trials for PPCs, our case report demonstrates the potential application of pembrolizumab and radiation therapy for the treatment of PPCs.

TI  - Update on the Management of Stage III NSCLC: Navigating a Complex and Heterogeneous Stage of Disease
T2  - CURRENT ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Stage III nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents a heterogeneous group of patients. Many patients are treated with curative intent multimodality therapy, either surgical resection plus systemic therapy or chemoradiation plus immunotherapy. However, many patients are not suitable for curative intent therapy and are treated with palliative systemic therapy or best supportive care. Methods: This paper is a review of recent advances in the management of patients with curative intent disease. Results: There have been significant advances in curative intent therapy for patients with stage III NSCLC in recent years. These include both adjuvant and neoadjuvant systemic therapies. For patients with resectable NSCLC, two trials have demonstrated that adjuvant atezolizumab or pembrolizumab, following chemotherapy, significantly improved disease-free survival (DFS). In patients with tumours harbouring a common mutation of the EGFR gene, adjuvant osimertinib therapy was associated with a large improvement in both DFS and overall survival (OS). Five randomized trials have evaluated chemotherapy plus nivolumab, pembrolizumab, durvalumab, or toripalimab, either as neoadjuvant or perioperative (neoadjuvant plus adjuvant) therapy. All five trials show significant improvements in the rate of pathologic complete response (pCR) and event-free survival (EFS). OS data are currently immature. This would now be considered the standard of care for resectable stage III NSCLC. The addition of durvalumab to chemoradiation has also become the standard of care in unresectable stage III NSCLC. One year of consolidation durvalumab following concurrent chemoradiation has demonstrated significant improvements in both progression-free and overall survival. Conclusions: Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy has become a standard recommendation in curative intent therapy for stage III NSCLC.

TI  - Racotumomab for treating lung cancer and pediatric refractory malignancies
T2  - EXPERT OPINION ON BIOLOGICAL THERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Racotumomab (originally known as 1E10 mAb) is an anti-idiotype murine IgG1 directed to membrane glycoconjugates expressed in aggressive solid tumors. It was developed as a mirror image of the idiotype of another antibody against N-glycolyl-containing molecules, such as the NeuGcGM3 ganglioside. After a successful phase II/III study, racotumomab formulated in alum was conditionally approved in Latin American countries as maintenance therapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer.Areas covered: This review analyzes the biology of the target antigen, summarizes preclinical studies and discusses clinical trials in adults and the pediatric experience with racotumomab.Expert opinion: Proper patient selection and combination with chemotherapy, radiotherapy or checkpoint inhibitors appear to be critical issues to maximize the effects of racotumomab vaccination in lung cancer. In a recent phase I clinical trial in children with relapsed or resistant neuroectodermal malignancies, racotumomab was well tolerated and immunogenic, and its evaluation as immunotherapy for high-risk neuroblastoma is warranted.

TI  - Tumor Immunology and Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.
T2  - Tuberculosis and respiratory diseases
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - Lung cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Although progress in the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has been made over the past decade, the 5-year survival rate in patients with lung cancer remains only 10%-20%. Obviously, new therapeutic options are required for patients with advanced NSCLC and unmet medical needs. Cancer immunotherapy is an evolving treatment modality that uses a patient's own immune systems to fight cancer. Theoretically, cancer immunotherapy can result in long-term cancer remission and may not cause the same side effects as chemotherapy and radiation. Immuno-oncology has become an important focus of basic research as well as clinical trials for the treatment of NSCLC. Immune checkpoint inhibitors are the most promising approach for cancer immunotherapy and they have become the standard of care for patients with advanced NSCLC. This review summarizes basic tumor immunology and the relevant clinical data on immunotherapeutic approaches, especially immune checkpoint inhibitors in NSCLC.

TI  - Therapeutic effectiveness and safety of sequential ICIs with radiotherapy for symptomatic brain and bone metastases in NSCLC patients
T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - In advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the brain and bones are common metastatic sites, and the disease seriously affects the survival time and quality of life. For metastatic lesions with symptoms, local treatment often precedes systemic treatment. However, in clinical trials, patients with symptomatic brain or bone metastases are often excluded. Therefore, limited data are available on the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in those patients. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of local radiotherapy followed by ICIs in driver gene-negative NSCLC patients with symptomatic local metastasis in the brain and bone. This is a 29-month 2 centered retrospective cohort study performed in China between March 2019 and August 2021. A total of 22 patients with advanced NSCLC were included. All patients received radiotherapy in the brain or bone before the administration of ICIs. For all patients, the overall response rate was 59.09%, the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 7.5 months, the PFS rate at 6 months was 72.73%, and the PFS rate at 1 year was 13.64%. Waterfall plots showed that tumor size was mostly reduced compared with baseline. The spider map showed that the tumor continued to shrink. In terms of symptom improvement, 100% pain control and 83.33% improvement were observed in epilepsy and neurological function. Sequential ICIs with local radiotherapy is effective for the treatment of patients with symptomatic brain and bone metastases of driver gene-negative NSCLC, which will benefit patients and improve their symptoms.

TI  - Local ablative radiotherapy for oligometastatic non-small cell lung cancer
T2  - RADIATION ONCOLOGY JOURNAL
M3  - Review
AB  - In metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the role of radiotherapy (RT) has been limited to palliation to alleviate the symptoms. However, with the development of advanced RT techniques, recent advances in immuno-oncology therapy targeting programmed death 1 (PD-1) and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and targeted agents for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) translocation allowed new roles of RT in these patients. Within this metastatic population, there is a subset of patients with a limited number of sites of metastatic disease, termed as oligometastasis that can achieve long-term survival from aggressive local management. There is no consensus on the definition of oligometastasis; however, most clinical trials define oligometastasis as having 3 to 5 metastatic lesions. Recent phase II randomized clinical trials have shown that ablative RT, including stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) and hypofractionated RT, to primary and metastatic sites improved progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with oligometastatic NSCLC. The PEMBRO-RT study, a randomized phase II study comparing SABR prior to pembrolizumab therapy and pembrolizumab therapy alone, revealed that the addition of SABR improved the overall response, PFS, and OS in patients with advanced NSCLC. The efficacy of RT in oligometastatic lung cancer has only been studied in phase II studies; therefore, large-scale phase III studies are needed to confirm the benefit of local ablative RT in patients with oligometastatic NSCLC. Local intensified RT to primary and metastatic lesions is expected to become an important treatment paradigm in the near future in patients with metastatic lung cancer.

M3  - Review
AB  - Lung cancer is one of the most common malignant neoplasms. As a result of the disease's progression, patients may develop metastases to the central nervous system. The prognosis in this location is unfavorable; untreated metastatic lesions may lead to death within one to two months. Existing therapies-neurosurgery and radiation therapy-do not improve the prognosis for every patient. The discovery of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)-activating mutations and Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) rearrangements in patients with non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma has allowed for the introduction of small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors to the treatment of advanced-stage patients. The Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) is a transmembrane protein with tyrosine kinase-dependent activity. EGFR is present in membranes of all epithelial cells. In physiological conditions, it plays an important role in the process of cell growth and proliferation. Binding the ligand to the EGFR causes its dimerization and the activation of the intracellular signaling cascade. Signal transduction involves the activation of MAPK, AKT, and JNK, resulting in DNA synthesis and cell proliferation. In cancer cells, binding the ligand to the EGFR also leads to its dimerization and transduction of the signal to the cell interior. It has been demonstrated that activating mutations in the gene for EGFR-exon19 (deletion), L858R point mutation in exon 21, and mutation in exon 20 results in cancer cell proliferation. Continuous stimulation of the receptor inhibits apoptosis, stimulates invasion, intensifies angiogenesis, and facilitates the formation of distant metastases. As a consequence, the cancer progresses. These activating gene mutations for the EGFR are present in 10-20% of lung adenocarcinomas. Approximately 3-7% of patients with lung adenocarcinoma have the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4)/ALK fusion gene. The fusion of the two genes EML4 and ALK results in a fusion gene that activates the intracellular signaling pathway, stimulates the proliferation of tumor cells, and inhibits apoptosis. A new group of drugs-small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors-has been developed; the first generation includes gefitinib and erlotinib and the ALK inhibitor crizotinib. These drugs reversibly block the EGFR by stopping the signal transmission to the cell. The second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) afatinib or ALK inhibitor alectinib block the receptor irreversibly. Clinical trials with TKI in patients with non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma with central nervous system (CNS) metastases have shown prolonged, progression-free survival, a high percentage of objective responses, and improved quality of life. Resistance to treatment with this group of drugs emerging during TKI therapy is the basis for the detection of resistance mutations. The T790M mutation, present in exon 20 of the EGFR gene, is detected in patients treated with first- and second-generation TKI and is overcome by Osimertinib, a third-generation TKI. The I117N resistance mutation in patients with the ALK mutation treated with alectinib is overcome by ceritinib. In this way, sequential therapy ensures the continuity of treatment. In patients with CNS metastases, attempts are made to simultaneously administer radiation therapy and tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Patients with lung adenocarcinoma with CNS metastases, without activating EGFR mutation and without ALK rearrangement, benefit from immunotherapy.This therapeutic option blocks the PD-1 receptor on the surface of T or B lymphocytes or PD-L1 located on cancer cells with an applicable antibody. Based on clinical trials, pembrolizumab and all antibodies are included in the treatment of non-small cell lung carcinoma with CNS metastases.

TI  - Immune Checkpoint Blockade Therapy May Be a Feasible Option for Primary Pulmonary Lymphoepithelioma-like Carcinoma
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Primary pulmonary lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma (PPLELC) is a rare subtype of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) for which there is currently no recognized treatment. Recently, favorable immune checkpoint blockade responses have been observed in PPLELC. This study aimed to review the effects of this regimen in patients with advanced PPLELC. PPLELC patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors at West China Hospital between January 2008 and December 2019 were retrospectively identified. Demographic parameters and antitumor treatment details were retrieved and reviewed. Among 128 patients diagnosed with PPLELC, 5 who received immune checkpoint inhibitors at advanced stages were included in the analysis. All of these patients were female nonsmokers with a median age of 55.6 (range 53-58) years at diagnosis. Their median PD-L1 expression was 40% (range, 30-80%). Although the patients underwent surgeries, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, all the treatments failed. Immune checkpoint inhibitors were administered palliatively, and three patients responded favorably, with the best overall response being partial remission (PR). Thus, immune checkpoint inhibitors may be a promising treatment for advanced PPLELC, and large clinical trials are warranted to obtain more evidence regarding this regimen.

TI  - Adebrelimab plus chemotherapy and sequential thoracic radiotherapy as fi rst-line therapy for extensive-stage small-cell - cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC): a phase II trial
T2  - ECLINICALMEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background This phase II prospective trial aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of adebrelimab (PD-L1 antibody) plus first-line chemotherapy followed by sequential thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) combined with adebrelimab in extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). Biomarkers associated with potential therapeutic effects were also explored. Methods Patients with previously untreated ES-SCLC were enrolled at Shandong Cancer Hospital and Institute (Jinan, China). Patients received 4-6 cycles of adebrelimab (20 mg/kg, D1, Q3W) combined with EP/EC (etoposide, 100 mg/m(2), D1-3, Q3W and cisplatin, 75 mg/m(2), D1, Q3W or carboplatin, AUC = 5, D1, Q3W). Then patients with response sequentially underwent consolidative TRT (>= 30 Gy in 10 fractions or >= 50 Gy in 25 fractions, involved-field irradiation), and maintenance adebrelimab until disease progression or intolerable adverse events (AEs). The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Genomic and circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) profiling were also analyzed with tumour tissues and peripheral blood. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04562337. Findings From October 2020 to April 2023, 67 patients diagnosed with ES-SCLC were enrolled and received at least one dose of study treatment. All patients were included in the efficacy and safety analyses. 45 patients received sequential TRT as planned. The median OS and progression-free survival (PFS) was 21.4 months (95% CI: 17.2-not reached months) and 10.1 months (95% CI: 6.9-15.5 months), respectively. The confirmed objective response rate was 71.6% (48/67, 95% CI: 59.3-82.0%) and disease control rate was 89.6% (60/67, 95% CI: 79.7-95.7%). There were no treatment-related deaths. The most common grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were hematological toxicities. The incidence of any grade and G3+ pneumonitis was 25% (17/67) and 6% (4/67), respectively. No unexpected adverse events were observed. Patients without co-mutations of TP53/RB1 in both tissue and peripheral blood displayed longer PFS (tissue, P = 0.071; ctDNA, P = 0.060) and OS (tissue, P = 0.032; ctDNA, P = 0.031). Interpretation Adebrelimab plus chemotherapy and sequential TRT as first-line therapy for ES-SCLC showed promising efficacy and acceptable safety.

TI  - Targeted therapy moves to earlier stages of non-small-cell lung cancer: emerging evidence, controversies and future challenges
T2  - FUTURE ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Lung cancer continues to be the leading cause of cancer mortality and a serious health problem despite the numerous advances made in the last decade and the rapid advance of research in this field. In recent years, there has been a decrease in mortality from lung cancer coinciding with the approval times of targeted therapy. To date, targeted therapy has been used in the context of advanced disease in clinical practice, with great benefits in survival and quality of life. The next step will be to incorporate targeted therapy into the treatment of earlier stages of non-small-cell lung cancer, and there is already a randomized trial showing a disease-free survival benefit. However, there are many questions that need to be resolved first. In the present review, the authors discuss the findings of published reports and ongoing clinical trials assessing the role of targeted therapies in nonmetastatic disease.Lay abstract Despite major therapeutic advances over the last decade, lung cancer continues to present the highest mortality rate of all cancers. Precision and personalized therapy directed at specific alterations in the genetic material of the tumor as well as immunotherapy has significantly improved survival in metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer. The next step will be to incorporate precision medicine into the treatment of earlier stages of non-small-cell lung cancer. The recent publication of the results of the ADAURA phase III trial showing a significant improvement in disease-free survival in patients with resected EGFR-mutated non-small-cell lung cancer who received an adjuvant EGFR-directed tyrosine kinase inhibitor called osimertinib has opened the doors to the incorporation of this novel agent into routine clinical practice. However, there are many questions that need to be resolved first. In the present review, the authors discuss the findings of published reports and ongoing clinical trials assessing the role of precision medicine in nonmetastatic disease.Tweetable abstract The time has come to offer targeted therapy to patients with earlier-stage non-small-cell lung cancer, which could represent an important qualitative leap in the treatment of lung cancer patients.

TI  - Systemic Immune Activation and Responses of Irradiation to Different Metastatic Sites Combined With Immunotherapy in Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeConsidering the limited data, we aimed to identify the greatest immune activation irradiated site of common metastases and response to immune checkpoint inhibitors simultaneously in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). MethodsA total of 136 patients with advanced NSCLC who had received radiation to a primary or metastatic solid tumor were enrolled. We recorded blood cell counts in three time periods, before, during, and after radiotherapy (RT), and derived some blood index ratios including monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and systemic immune-inflammation index (SII). The delta-IBs were calculated as medio-IBs divided by pre-IBs - 1. We analyzed the changes before and during RT using Spearman rank correlation test, Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test, and logistic regression analyzing their correlation with efficacy. ResultsThe medians of delta-MLR and delta-PLR were both the lowest while the median of delta-L was the highest in brain. Therapeutic effect evaluation showed that the objective response rate (ORR) of 48.65% (18/37) in the brain irradiation group was the highest, compared with 17.07% (7/41) in bone and 41.94% (13/31) in lung. ConclusionsIn this study, results suggested that irradiation to brain has the best immune activation effect and patient outcome compared with other organs in NSCLC, and when the earlier-line ICIs were combined with RT, a better patient outcome was reached. Prospective studies are also necessary to provide more convincing evidence and standards for clinical irradiation metastases selection.

TI  - Focal Radiotherapy of Brain Metastases in Combination With Immunotherapy and Targeted Drug Therapy
T2  - DEUTSCHES ARZTEBLATT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Advances in systemic treatment and in brain imaging have led to a higher incidence of diagnosed brain metastases. In the treatment of brain metastases, stereotactic radiotherapy and radiosurgery, systemic immunotherapy, and targeted drug therapy are important evidence-based options. In this review. we summarize the available evidence on the treatment of brain metastases of the three main types of cancer that give rise to them: non-small-cell lung cancer, breast cancer, and malignant melanoma.Methods: This narrative review is based on pertinent original articles. meta-analyses. and systematic reviews that were retrieved by a selective search in PubMed. These publications were evaluated and discussed by an expert panel including radiation oncologists. neurosurgeons. and oncologists.Results: There have not yet been any prospective randomized trials concerning the optimal combination of local stereotactic radiotherapy/radiosurgery and systemic immunotherapy or targeted therapy. Retrospective studies have consistently shown a benefit from early combined treatment with systemic therapy and (in particular) focal radiotherapy. compared to sequential treatment. Two meta-analyses of retrospective data from cohorts consisting mainly of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer and melanoma revealed longer overall survival after combined treatment with focal radiotherapy and checkpoint inhibitor therapy (rate of 12-month overall survival for combined versus non-combined treatment: 64.6% vs. 51.6%, p <0.001). In selected patients with small, asymptomatic brain metastases in non-critical locations. systemic therapy without focal radiotherapy can be considered, as long as follow-up with cranial magnetic resonance imaging can be performed at close intervals.Conclusion: Brain metastases should be treated by a multidisciplinary team, so that the optimal sequence of local and systemic therapies can be determined for each individual patient.

T2  - INTERNAL MEDICINE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Lung cancer accounts for approximately 1 in 10 new cancer diagnoses annually and is responsible for the most cancer-associated deaths in Australia. Despite such figures, there is reason for optimism with many practice-changing developments to report for the management of patients with thoracic malignancies over the last few years. We outline such changes, including the emerging role of immunotherapy in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant setting for patients with localised non-small-cell lung cancer, as well as the established standard of consolidation immunotherapy following definitive chemoradiotherapy for those with locally advanced disease. In the metastatic setting, combination chemotherapy-immunotherapy approaches have become the new paradigm for most patients in the absence of a recognised driver mutation. A range of novel targeted therapies now exist and are Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS)-subsidised for targets such as EGFR, ALK and ROS1, with many others, such as KRAS G12C, NTRK, MET, RET and HER2, also with therapies rapidly being developed. Even among patients with small-cell lung cancer, who account for the worst prognoses and until recently have received a chemotherapy regimen that has remained unchanged in over 20 years, there is a new standard-of-care in combination chemotherapy-immunotherapy. Furthermore, immunotherapy and potentially anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents now also play a role in mesothelioma treatment. Last, given recent developments in immunotherapy, targeted therapy and combination approaches in the non-small-cell lung cancer space, there is an increasing recognition of the diversity of lived experience for such patients and need for survivorship programmes to acknowledge such nuances.

TI  - Four-Phase, Definitive Chemoradiation for a Real-World (Poor Risk and/or Elderly) Patient Population With Locally Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionWith the incorporation of modernized radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy, treatment outcomes have improved for patients with locally advanced, unresectable diseases. Elderly or poor performance status patients comprise more than half of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, but they are often underrepresented or excluded in clinical trials. Split-course concurrent chemoradiotherapy can be an effective treatment, showing good adherence and a favorable toxicity profile for unresectable, locally advanced NSCLC.MethodWe identified locally advanced NSCLC cancer patients via a single institution retrospective study. Patients were treated using a four-phase, split-course external beam radiotherapy approach with concurrent chemotherapy. The primary endpoints analyzed were completion rate, incidence, and severity of treatment-related toxicities, progression-free survival (PFS), and median overall survival (OS).ResultsThirty-nine locally advanced lung cancer patients were treated with split-course chemoradiation (CRT). The median age at diagnosis was 73 years old. Seventeen patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score of 2. Twenty-three patients had a clinical diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and 10 patients were on home oxygen at the time of diagnosis. All patients completed 6000 centigrays (cGy) of radiation, and 95% of the patients completed at least three cycles of concurrent chemotherapy. No patients experienced grade 3 to 5 acute thoracic toxicities. Overall median survival was 12.7 months, and PFS was 7.5 months.ConclusionOur retrospective analysis of 39 poor risk and/or elderly patients with locoregional NSCLC treated with concurrent CRT via a split-course regimen suggests favorable oncologic outcomes and superb treatment completion rates and toleration.

TI  - Novel radiotherapy approaches for lung cancer: combining radiation therapy with targeted and immunotherapies.
T2  - Translational lung cancer research
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - Targeted therapies and immunotherapies have quickly become fixtures in the treatment armamentarium for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Targeted therapies directed against epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) translocations, and ROS-1 rearrangements have demonstrated improved progression free survival (PFS) and, in selected populations, improved overall survival (OS) compared with cytotoxic chemotherapy. Immunotherapies, including checkpoint inhibitor monoclonal antibodies against programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1) and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), have now also demonstrated improved survival compared with chemotherapy. The use of these novel systemic agents in non-metastatic patient populations and in combination with radiation therapy is not well defined. As radiation therapy has become more effective and more conformal with fewer toxicities, it has increasingly been used in the oligometastatic or oligoprogression setting. This has allowed improvement in PFS and potentially OS, and in the oligoprogressive setting may overcome acquired drug resistance of a specific lesion(s) to allow patients to remain on their targeted therapies. Molecularly targeted therapies and immunotherapies for patients with metastatic NSCLC have demonstrated much success. Advances in radiation therapy and stereotactic body radiotherapy, radiation therapy have led to combination strategies with targeted therapies among patients with lung cancer. Radiation therapy has also been combined with immunotherapies predominantly in the metastatic setting. In the metastatic population, radiation therapy has the ability to provide durable local control and also augment the immune response of systemic agents, which may lead to an abscopal effect of immune-mediated tumor response in disease sites outside of the radiation field in select patients.

TI  - Immunotherapeutic Agents in Non-small-cell Lung Cancer Finally Coming to the Front Lines
T2  - CURRENT ONCOLOGY REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Non-small-cell lung cancer usually carries a dismal prognosis. Novel treatment approaches are clearly warranted. Immunotherapy has emerged as a promising area of research developing agents that manipulate the immune system to induce antitumor responses while avoiding major toxicity. New vaccines and checkpoint inhibitors are currently undergoing investigation in phase II and phase III clinical trials. In advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), belagenpumatucel-L, an allogeneic cell vaccine directed against transforming growth factor beta in the tumor microenvironment, knocks down the immune suppression caused by the tumor and has demonstrated a doseand time-dependent efficacy in some subgroups of patients. L-BLP25 and TG4010 are both antigenic vaccines that target mucin 1, whose encoding proto-oncogene is commonly mutated in solid tumors. The L-BLP25 vaccine achieved a significant improvement in overall survival in the subgroup of patients with stage IIIB NSCLC treated with chemoradiotherapy. TG4010 vaccination resulted in better progression-free survival when added to cisplatin-gemcitabine chemotherapy. These results are being addressed in the currently ongoing phase III TIME trial. In the adjuvant setting, MAGE-A3, an antigen-based vaccine, showed promising results in melanoma-associated antigen A3 positive lung cancer patients who underwent resection in the phase II study; however, no improvement in progressionfree survival was observed in the phase III MAGRIT study. CIMAVax is a recombinant human epidermal growth factor (EGF) vaccine that induces anti-EGF antibody production and prevents EGF from binding to its receptor. It has improved overall survival in patients with advanced NSCLC who achieve seroconversion. Ipilimumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor that targets cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4, demonstrated improved progression-free survival in advanced NSCLC patients who received the drug after chemotherapy in a phased regimen. Finally, anti-programmed death receptor 1 agents have achieved durable response rates in phase I studies. This review gives an overview of the current data and the most promissory immunotherapeutic agents for NSCLC.

T2  - Zhongguo fei ai za zhi = Chinese journal of lung cancer
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
M3  - English Abstract
AB  - The incidence of cancer is closely correlated with age, as 75% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients are aged at least 65 years. The availability of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has altered the available NSCLC therapeutic pattern. Limited studies on elderly patients have demonstrated that ICIs as monotherapy provide substantial benefits for patients aged 65-75 years, showing no significant difference compared to younger patients. This benefit is also observed in combination with immune-combined chemotherapy or radiotherapy. For individuals older than 75 years, the survival effect was not evident, though. Immune-related adverse events (irAEs) with ICIs alone were similar in incidence across age categories. Immune-combination chemotherapy resulted in a higher incidence of irAEs than chemotherapy alone, and patients ≥75 years of age were more likely to experience higher-grade irAEs. Besides the fact that immunosenescence in older patients influences the immune milieu in a multifaceted manner, which in turn impacts the effectiveness of immunotherapy, the prognosis is also influenced by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) score, among other factors. For certain individuals aged ≥75 years or in poor physical health, immunotherapy combined with low-intensity chemotherapy has emerged as a viable treatment option. However, there are fewer related studies, so there should be a conscious effort to increase the number of elderly patients enrolled in the trial and a comprehensive assessment to explore individualized treatment options. To provide additional references and guidance for immunotherapy in elderly NSCLC patients and to propose new therapeutic perspectives in combination with their characteristics, this review aims to summarize and analyze the pertinent studies on the application of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors in these patients. .
AB  - 【中文题目：老年晚期NSCLC患者PD-1/PD-L1 免疫检查点抑制剂治疗现状及展望】 【中文摘要：癌症发病率与年龄密切相关，75%的非小细胞肺癌（non-small cell lung cancer, NSCLC）患者年龄均≥65岁。免疫检查点抑制剂（immune checkpoint inhibitors, ICIs）的出现改变了NSCLC的治疗格局。针对老年患者有限的研究发现对于65-75岁的患者，ICIs单药显示出良好的获益，与年轻患者无明显差异，这种获益在免疫联合化疗或放疗中也有所体现。但是对于≥75岁的患者来说生存获益不明显。ICIs单药在不同年龄段的患者中免疫相关不良反应（immune-related adverse events, irAEs）发生率相似，免疫联合化疗对比单纯化疗导致irAEs的发生率高，≥75岁患者发生更高级别irAEs的可能性更大。除了老年患者免疫衰老会从多维度影响免疫微环境从而影响免疫治疗疗效外，东部肿瘤协作组体力状态（Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, ECOG PS）评分等也会影响预后。对于部分≥75岁或身体状况较差的患者，免疫联合低强度化疗成为有潜力的治疗方式之一，但相关研究较少，所以应有意识增加老年患者入组试验的人数，同时综合评估，探索个体化治疗方案。本综述拟对老年NSCLC患者应用抗程序性死亡受体1（programmed cell death protein 1, PD-1）及其配体（programmed cell death ligand 1, PD-L1）的相关研究进行汇总分析，以期为老年NSCLC患者的免疫治疗提供更多参考和指导，并结合其特点提出新的治疗展望。 】 【中文关键词：肺肿瘤；老年非小细胞肺癌；免疫衰老；免疫治疗；免疫联合低强度化疗】.

TI  - Consolidative thoracic radiation therapy for extensive-stage small cell lung cancer in the era of first-line chemoimmunotherapy: preclinical data and a retrospective study in Southern Italy
T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Consolidative thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) has been commonly used in the management of extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). Nevertheless, phase III trials exploring first-line chemoimmunotherapy have excluded this treatment approach. However, there is a strong biological rationale to support the use of radiotherapy (RT) as a boost to sustain anti-tumor immune responses. Currently, the benefit of TRT after chemoimmunotherapy remains unclear. The present report describes the real-world experiences of 120 patients with ES-SCLC treated with different chemoimmunotherapy combinations. Preclinical data supporting the hypothesis of anti-tumor immune responses induced by RT are also presented. Methods: A total of 120 ES-SCLC patients treated with chemoimmunotherapy since 2019 in the South of Italy were retrospectively analyzed. None of the patients included in the analysis experienced disease progression after undergoing first-line chemoimmunotherapy. Of these, 59 patients underwent TRT after a multidisciplinary decision by the treatment team. Patient characteristics, chemoimmunotherapy schedule, and timing of TRT onset were assessed. Safety served as the primary endpoint, while efficacy measured in terms of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) was used as the secondary endpoint. Immune pathway activation induced by RT in SCLC cells was explored to investigate the biological rationale for combining RT and immunotherapy. Results: Preclinical data supported the activation of innate immune pathways, including the STimulator of INterferon pathway (STING), gamma-interferon-inducible protein (IFI-16), and mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) related to DNA and RNA release. Clinical data showed that TRT was associated with a good safety profile. Of the 59 patients treated with TRT, only 10% experienced radiation toxicity, while no >= G3 radiation-induced adverse events occurred. The median time for TRT onset after cycles of chemoimmunotherapy was 62 days. Total radiation dose and fraction dose of TRT include from 30 Gy in 10 fractions, up to definitive dose in selected patients. Consolidative TRT was associated with a significantly longer PFS than systemic therapy alone (one-year PFS of 61% vs. 31%, p<0.001), with a trend toward improved OS (one-year OS of 80% vs. 61%, p=0.027). Conclusion: Multi-center data from establishments in the South of Italy provide a general confidence in using TRT as a consolidative strategy after chemoimmunotherapy. Considering the limits of a restrospective analysis, these preliminary results support the feasibility of the approach and encourage a prospective evaluation.

TI  - The safety of atezolizumab plus chemotherapy for the treatment of metastatic lung cancer
T2  - EXPERT OPINION ON DRUG SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Atezolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against PD-L1 capable of enhancing antitumor immune activity, with a demonstrated activity as single agent in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Areas covered This review summarizes the clinical data emerging from randomized clinical studies with atezolizumab in NSCLC and small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), focusing in particular on the efficacy and safety data regarding the combinations of atezolizumab plus chemotherapy in the IMpower studies. Expert opinion A significant improvement in progression-free survival and in overall survival was observed in IMpower 130 and 150 (NSCLC non-squamous) and 133 (SCLC), with an acceptable safety profile. In particular, the most common immune-related adverse events were rash (18-28% of patients), hypothyroidism (8-15%), hepatitis (5-17%), pneumonitis (2-7%), and colitis (1.5-2.3%). The safety profile of atezolizumab in combination with chemotherapy was consistent with the known adverse events related to single-agent atezolizumab and no new adverse events were observed. Ongoing studies will evaluate the role of atezolizumab in other settings (adjuvant and neoadjuvant) and in combination with chemotherapy and radiotherapy for patients with locally advanced NSCLC and the role of predictive factors (B-FAST study).

TI  - Locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer: current issues and recent trends
T2  - REPORTS OF PRACTICAL ONCOLOGY AND RADIOTHERAPY
M3  - Review
AB  - The focus of this paper was to review and summarise the current issues and recent trends within the framework of locally advanced (LA) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The recently proposed 8th tumour-node-metastases (TNM) staging system exhibited significant amendments in the distribution of the T and M descriptors. Every revision to the TNM classification should contribute to clinical improvement. This is particularly necessary regarding LA NSCLC stratification, therapy and outcomes. While several studies reported the superiority of the 8th TNM edition in comparison to the previous 7th TNM edition, in terms of both the discrimination ability among the various T subgroups and clinical outcomes, others argued against this interpretation. Synergistic cytotoxic chemotherapy with radiotherapy is most prevalent in treating LA NSCLC. Clinical trial experience from multiple references has reported that the risk of locoregional relapse and distant metastasis was less evident for patients treated with concomitant radiochemotherapy than radiotherapy alone. Nevertheless, concern persists as to whether major incidences of toxicity may occur due to the addition of chemotherapy. Cutting-edge technologies such as four-dimensional computed tomography (4D-CT) and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) should yield therapeutic gains due to their capability to conform radiation doses to tumours. On the basis of the preceding notion, the optimum radiotherapy technique for LA NSCLC has been a controversial and much-disputed subject within the field of radiation oncology. Notably, no single-perspective research has been undertaken to determine the optimum radiotherapy modality for LA NSCLC. The landscape of immunotherapy in lung cancer is rapidly expanding. Currently, the standard of care for patients with inoperable LA NSCLC is concurrent chemoradiotherapy followed by maintenance durvalumab according to clinical outcomes from the PACIFIC trial. An estimated 42.9% of patients randomly assigned to durvalumab remained alive at five years, and free of disease progression, thereby establishing a new benchmark for the standard of care in this setting.

TI  - Radiotherapy Dose and Induction Chemotherapy Cycles Are Associated With Prognosis and Toxicity Risk: A Retrospective Study of 227 Patients With Unresectable Stage III Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer
T2  - TECHNOLOGY IN CANCER RESEARCH & TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Concurrent chemoradiation (cCHRT) has been confirmed as the standard treatment for local advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study is to assess the appropriate timing of radiotherapy and cycles of induction chemotherapy for those patients. Methods: 227 inoperable stage III NSCLC patients were selected, we analyzed the potential prognostic factors and the influence of induction chemotherapy was evaluated. Results: The median survival time was 20.7 months; only 25 patients chose chemotherapy alone (11.0%), 137 patients underwent sequential chemoradiation (sCHRT, 60.4%), and 65 patients received cCHRT (28.6%). Multivariate analyses showed radiation therapy (P = 0.001), the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score (P = 0.000) and the lymph node stage (P = 0.001) were independent prognostic factors. cCHRT was not found to be superior (P = 0.330). We selected patients received 60-66 Gy and found the cCHRT groups achieved a relatively better outcome, with a median Overall Survival (OS) of 25.2 months vs 20.1 months in the sCHRT group (P = 0.019). We also found cycles of induction chemotherapy did not compromise survival; however, >= 3 cycles resulted in more grade 3-4 hematology toxicities, with a proportion of 18/99 compared with 53/103 among patients who underwent <= 3 cycles. In addition, higher grade hematology toxicities and poor ECOG were also the most common reasons for abandoning cCHRT. Conclusions: For inoperable stage III NSCLC, cCHRT showed its superiority only when the radiotherapy dose was 60-66 Gy. Cycles of induction chemotherapy did not interfere with survival; however, >= 3 cycles resulted in more grade 3-4 hematology toxicities, leading to the cessation of cCHRT.

TI  - Early administration of durvalumab after chemoradiotherapy increased risk of pneumonitis in patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer
T2  - ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims Durvalumab (Durva) administration after chemoradiation therapy (CRT) in locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the standard of care, associated with relatively prolonged progression-free (PFS) and overall survival. However, pneumonitis occurs in 73.6% of Japanese patients. This retrospective study aimed to identify factors associated with Durva efficacy and safety, specifically, the risk of pneumonitis. Methods This study included data from 26 consecutive patients with locally advanced NSCLC who underwent CRT followed by Durva. The rates of adverse events and PFS were examined. Results The median PFS time was 15.6 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.7-not available). Patients developed pneumonitis of grade 1, 2, 3, and 4 at the rate of 62%, 27%, 12%, and 0%, respectively. The median PFS time was 6.4 months for patients with programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression level of <50% and not reached for patients with PD-L1 expression level of >= 50% (hazard ratio [HR], 0.19; 95% CI: 0.04-0.89), which was significantly prolonged. The cumulative incidence of pneumonitis grade 2 or above was significantly higher when the time between the last day of thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) and the start of Durva therapy was within 14 days compared to >14 days (HR: 0.19; 95% CI: 0.06-0.59). This association was statistically significant in multivariate analysis. Conclusions The initiation of Durva therapy within 14 days after TRT may increase the risk of pneumonitis grade 2 or above. Careful observation and suitable treatment are recommended.

TI  - Clinical outcomes and synergistic effect between radiotherapy and immunotherapy in patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer: a real-world study
T2  - BMC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) experience significant therapeutic challenges and limited survival rates. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of combining immunotherapy (IT) with chemotherapy (CT) for treating ES-SCLC and to explore the synergistic effect between radiotherapy (RT) and IT. Methods This retrospective analysis examined patients with ES-SCLC who received treatment at three centers. Furthermore, propensity score-matched (PSM) analysis was conducted. The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards regression were used to compare the survival outcomes. Results A total of 257 eligible patients with ES-SCLC were included in the analysis. Among all patients, the median overall survival (mOS) was 18.0 m in the chemoimmunotherapy (CT + IT) group and 15.7 m in the CT group (p = 0.208). The median real-world progression-free survival (mrwPFS) was 7.7 m and 6.8 m (p = 0.043) in the CT + IT and CT group, respectively. Moreover, the mOS was 22.0 m in the chemoradiotherapy (CT + RT) group and 13.6 m in the CT group (p < 0.001). The mrwPFS was 7.4 m and 6.0 m (p = 0.175) in the CT + RT group and CT group, respectively. The multivariate analyses revealed that sex, liver metastasis and RT were independent prognostic factors for OS (p < 0.05), while liver metastasis and IT were found to be independent predictive factors of real-world progression-free survival (rwPFS) (p < 0.05). After PSM, the mOS was 23.2 m in the CT + IT group and 13.0 m in the CT group (p = 0.008). The mrwPFS was 7.3 m and 6.2 m (p = 0.096) in the CT + IT group and the CT group, respectively. Moreover, the mOS was 21.4 m in the CT + RT group and 12.5 m in the CT group (p < 0.001). The mrwPFS was 7.3 m and 5.2 m (p = 0.220) in the CT + RT group and the CT group, respectively. Additionally, our study revealed that in the PD-1 group, RT significantly improved patient survival (36.0 m vs. 15.8 m, p = 0.041). Conclusion An increasing number of treatment options are being explored for ES-SCLC, and CT is the cornerstone of treatment for this disease. Combining CT with IT and RT has demonstrated remarkable efficacy and excellent safety profiles, and such treatments are worthy of further exploration.

TI  - Synergistic effect of immunotherapy and radiotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer: current clinical trials and prospective challenges
T2  - PRECISION CLINICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Lately, the success of ICIs has drastically changed the landscape of cancer treatment, and several immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, numerous patients are resistant to ICIs and require additional procedures for better efficacy results. Thus, combination therapy is urgently needed to strengthen the anti-tumor immunity. A variety of preclinical and clinical studies combining ICIs with radiotherapy (RT) have demonstrated that the combination could induce synergistic effects, as RT overcomes the resistance to ICIs. However, the underlying mechanism of the synergistic effect and the optimal arrangement of the combination therapy are indecisive now. Hence, this review was conducted to provide an update on the current clinical trial results and highlighted the ongoing trials. We also discussed the optimal parameters in clinical trials, including radiation dose, radiation fractionation, radiation target field, and sequencing of combination therapy. In this review, we found that combination therapy showed stronger anti-tumor immunity with tolerable toxicities in clinical trials. However, the best combination mode and potential biomarkers for the target patients in combination therapy are still unclear.

TI  - Effect of Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT) on the immunity, physical status and clinical effect of locally advanced NSCLC patients
T2  - PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: To evaluate the clinical value of radiotherapy combined with Camrelizumab in treating locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Methods: 80 locally advanced NSCLC patients were randomly divided into two groups (n=40). The control group was administered with intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), whereas the experimental group with Camrelizumab in addition to IMRT. All the patients underwent clinical efficacy evaluation in terms of adverse drug reaction (ADR), physical status improvement after the treatment, and changes in T lymphocyte subpopulations (incl. CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD4+/CD8+). Results: The efficacy was found to be 70% and 47.5 in experimental group and control group, respectively, with the former being significantly better than the latter (p=0.03). The ADR rates were 50% and 37.5% in the experimental group and control group, respectively; but the difference remained insignificant (p= 0.26). As for physical status improvement, experimental group evidently excelled the control group (p= 0.04). The post-treatment indicators such as CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD4+/CD8+ were significantly more improved in the experimental group than the control group (CD3+, p= 0.02; CD4+, p= 0.00; and CD4+/CD8+, p= 0.01). However, the changes in CD8+ were not significant at all (p= 0.46). Conclusions: The combined therapy of IMRT with Camrelizumab appeared effective in dealing with the locally advanced NSCLC patients, as such patients presented significantly better immune state and physical status improvement but not increased ADR. The therapy is both safe and effective.

TI  - Advancement in Cancer Immunotherapy in Veterinary Medicine: A Review
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Cancer is one of the leading cause of death in human beings throughout the world. Attempts to treat cancer are made but not effectively. Surgical removal, use of radiation therapy, chemotherapy and combination of these therapies have been tried to cure cancer but every therapy had its own side effects. Due to potential side effects, these therapies failed to develop as the permanent cure for cancer. Stem cell transplantation has also been attempted as an alternative but the recovery rate was very low. The most recent therapy, nowadays, to treat cancer is immunotherapy in which utilises the immunity of the patient to get modulated in such a way that cancerous cells get killed. So this review enlightens the eminent immunotherapies used for veterinary patients. T cell checkpoint inhibitors, engineered T cells, cancer vaccines and anti-B and anti-T cell antibodies are amongst the important immunotherapies used in human as well as veterinary patient. Inhibition of T cell checkpoint molecules, such as PD-1 and CTLA-4, using monoclonal antibodies are the most advanced techniques developed in humans. These significant immunotherapies have achieved notable success against some of the advanced tumors in humans, including melanoma, renal cell carcinoma and non small cell lung cancer. However, a recent clinical trial with a caninized monoclonal antibody against canine PD-L1 showed response in canine melanoma.

TI  - Prospective trial of immuno(chemo)therapy before resection, definitive chemoradiotherapy or palliative therapy in patients with locally advanced or oligometastatic non-small cell lung cancer without a primary curative option
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Recent phase II-III trials of immuno(chemo)therapy before resection in locally advanced resectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) report high rates of path-ological response and promising survival. However, primarily, patients who did not undergo resection were excluded from these studies. Moreover, there are no data on chemoradiother-apy (CRT) after immuno(chemo)therapy in patients who are primarily not amenable to CRT. We hypothesised that induction immuno(chemo)therapy may enable patients with NSCLC with a potentially curative stage (III-IVA), for whom primary curative treatment (either resection or CRT) is not possible for anatomical or functional reasons, to receive curative treatment. Patients and methods: We enrolled 35 patients with NSCLC with aforementioned characteris-tics into a prospective real-world trial of induction immuno(chemo)therapy followed by morphologic and metabolic reassessment and multidisciplinary board-guide d curative treatment (resection [preferred] or CRT) or palliative therapy. The primary end-point was the proportion of patients receiving curative treatment. Results: Thirty-two patients (91%) received curative treatment (11 resections and 21 CRT). 73% and 64% of patients who underwent resection had a major or complete pathological response, respectively. There were 14 recurrences: 2 (18%) in patients who underwent resection, 9 (43%) in patients who received CRT and 3 (100%) in patients who received palliative therapy (median follow-up 17 months). Eight tumour-related deaths occurred: 5 (24%) in patients who received CRT; and 3 (100%) in patients who received palliative therapy. There were no treatment-related deaths. Conclusions: In locally advanced or oligometastatic NSCLC without a primary curative option, induction immuno(chemo)therapy results in a high rate of curative treatment with promising early survival data. patients who underwent resection achieved a high rate of prognostically favourable pathological response.

TI  - Small-cell Lung Cancer in Very Elderly (≥ 80 Years) Patients
T2  - CLINICAL LUNG CANCER
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 18th Conference of the International-Society-of-Geriatric-Oncology (SIOG)
CL  - Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS
AB  - This study found that the survival of very elderly (>= 80 years) patients with small-cell lung cancer was associated with stage, performance status, and treatment option. Very elderly patients with small-cell lung cancer are a growing patient population who have not been previously reported on. Future progress will require trials specific to the elderly, integration of immunotherapy, greater supportive care, better geriatric assessment, and less toxic regimens.Background: This analysis was performed to describe the outcome of very elderly (>= 80 years) patients with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) as there is no published data regarding these patients. Materials and Methods: One hundred forty-six very elderly patients with SCLC were identified from the Institutional Lung Cancer Database ranging in age from 80 to 92 years (median, 82 years). Of these, 47 (32%) patients had limited-stage SCLC (L-SCLC), and 99 (68%) had extensive-stage SCLC (E-SCLC). All were Caucasian, and the majority (64%) were female. Sixty-seven (46%) patients had Zubrod performance status (PS) of 0 to 1. Results: Of the 146 patients, 44 (30%) received no therapy, 65 (45%) received chemotherapy alone, 27 (19%) received chemotherapy plus local therapy (thoracic radiotherapy [TRT] or surgery), and 10 (7%) received local therapy alone. The median survival was 5.4 months. On univariable analysis, age (P = .019), stage (L-SCLC vs. E-SCLC; P = .0002), PS (P < .0001), and treatment option (P <.0001) were associated with survival. On multivariable analysis, stage (P = .011), PS (P = .029), and treatment option (P <.0001) maintained significance. For entire cohort, the median survival was 1.3 months without active therapy, 6 months with local therapy alone, 7.2 months with chemotherapy alone, and 14.4 months with chemotherapy plus local therapy (P <.0001, univariable and multivariable). Similar survival findings in response to treatment were found when the L-SCLC and E-SCLC cohorts were separately analyzed. Conclusions: The survival of very elderly patients with SCLC was associated with stage (L-SCLC vs. E-SCLC), PS, and treatment option. Very elderly patients with SCLC often have limited functional reserve required to tolerate aggressive multimodality therapy but appeared to benefit from it. Geriatric assessments, careful monitoring, and extra support are warranted in elderly patients. Care should be individualized based on the desires and needs of each patient. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Treatment of early and locally advanced stages of non-small cell lung cancer
T2  - INNERE MEDIZIN
M3  - Review
AB  - Treatment concepts for patients with localized and locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are based on local treatment, surgery and/or radiotherapy, with curative intent. An adjuvant systemic treatment is added after primary resection of an operable NSCLC primarily to reduce the systemic risk of relapse. Locally advanced stages with mediastinal lymph node involvement carry a substantial risk of local and distant recurrence and require multimodal treatment strategies in an interdisciplinary approach. Recently, immunotherapy with programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) checkpoint inhibitors is increasingly being integrated into adjuvant, neoadjuvant or perioperative treatment concepts.

TI  - Phase I Trial of Pembrolizumab and Radiation Therapy after Induction Chemotherapy for Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer

M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 60th Annual Meeting of the American-Society-for-Radiation-Oncology (ASTRO)
CL  - San Antonio, TX
AB  - Intruduction: Radiation and immunotherapy have separately been shown to confer survival advantages to patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ESCLC), but failure rates remain high and combination therapy has been understudied. In this single-arm phase I trial (NCT02402920), we assessed the safety of combining pembrolizumab with thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) after induction chemotherapy for SCLC.Methods: Patients with ESCLC who had completed chemotherapy received TRT with pembrolizumab. The maximum tolerated dose of pembrolizumab was assessed by 3+3 dose-escalation; doses began at 100 mg and increased in 50 mg increments to 200 mg. Pembrolizumab was given every 3 weeks for up to 16 cycles; TRT was prescribed as 45 Gy in 15 daily fractions. Toxicity was evaluated with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0. The primary endpoint was safety of the combined therapy based on the incidence of doselimiting toxicity in the 35 days following initiation of treatment.Results: Thirty-eight patients with ESCLC (median age 65 years, range: 37-79 years) were enrolled from September 2015 through September 2017; 33 received per-protocol treatment, and all tolerated pembrolizumab at 100 to 200 mg with no dose-limiting toxicity in the 35-day window. There were no grade 4-5 toxicities; 2 (6%) patients experienced grade 3 events (n = 1 rash, n = 1 asthenia/paresthesia/autoimmune disorder) that were unlikely/doubtfully related to protocol therapy. The median followup time was 7.3 months (range: 1-13 months); median progression-free and overall survival times were 6.1 months (95% confidence interval: 4.1-8.1) and 8.4 months (95% confidence interval: 6.7-10.1).Conclusions: Concurrent pembrolizumab-TRT was tolerated well with few high-grade adverse events in the short-term; progression-free and overall survival rates are difficult to interpret due to heterogeneity in eligibility criteria (e.g., enrolling progressors on induction chemotherapy). Although randomized studies have shown benefits to TRT alone and immunotherapy alone, the safety of the combined regimen supports further investigation as a foundational approach for future prospective studies.

T2  - THERAPEUTIC ADVANCES IN CHRONIC DISEASE
M3  - Article
AB  - Although concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is recommended as standard of care in patients with locally advanced, unresectable, stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), many patients who refuse or are not eligible for chemotherapy received radiotherapy (RT) alone with 5-year overall survival (OS) rate of about 5-6%. Immune-checkpoint inhibitors have demonstrated objective antitumor responses in patients with advanced NSCLC, but it is unclear how these agents can be used in the curative therapy with concurrent radiation. We report three cases of stage III unresectable NSCLC patients who refused chemotherapy received radiation and pembrolizumab immunotherapy. All patients had no local-regional recurrence with acceptable tolerance.

TI  - Durvalumab in combination with chemoradiotherapy for patients with unresectable stage III non-small-cell lung cancer: Results from the phase 1 CLOVER study
T2  - LUNG CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: For patients with unresectable, stage III non -small -cell lung cancer (NSCLC), current standard of care is concurrent chemoradiotherapy (cCRT) followed by consolidation durvalumab. However, earlier initiation of durvalumab simultaneously with cCRT may increase antitumor activity relative to initiation after cCRT. The phase 1 CLOVER study (NCT03509012) evaluated durvalumab combined with cCRT in patients with advanced solid tumors; we report findings from the NSCLC cohort. Methods: CLOVER comprised a dose -limiting toxicity (DLT) assessment part, followed by an expansion part. In the NSCLC cohort, patients with previously untreated, unresectable, stage III NSCLC were enrolled in three treatment arms: durvalumab every 4 weeks (Q4W) + cisplatin + etoposide + radiotherapy (Arm 1); durvalumab Q4W + carboplatin + paclitaxel + radiotherapy (Arm 2); or durvalumab Q4W + carboplatin or cisplatin + pemetrexed + radiotherapy (non-squamous histology only; Arm 3). Patients received durvalumab until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was safety and tolerability. Results: Sixty-four patients were enrolled: 21, 22, and 21 in Arms 1, 2, and 3, respectively. One patient in Arm 1 had DLT (grade 3 aspartate aminotransferase increase and grade 4 alanine aminotransferase increase); no DLTs were observed in Arms 2 or 3. Grade 3/4 adverse events occurred in 76.6 % of patients overall; the most common were neutropenia (51.6 %), leukopenia (20.3 %), and anemia (17.2 %). In a post -hoc analysis, 7.8 % of patients had grade 3 pneumonitis/radiation pneumonitis (grouped term) events. Overall, the objective response rate was 60.9 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 47.9-72.9); median duration of response was 15.8 months (95 % CI, 9.0-not estimable [NE]). Median progression -free survival was 13.4 months (95 % CI, 8.8-20.1) and median overall survival was not reached (95 % CI, 21.9-NE). Conclusion: Durvalumab in combination with cCRT was well tolerated, with a manageable safety profile and showed encouraging antitumor activity in patients with unresectable, stage III NSCLC.

TI  - Prognostic ability of lung immune prognostic index in limited-stage small cell lung cancer
T2  - BMC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Lung immune prognostic index (LIPI) is a prognostic marker of extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) patients received immunotherapy or chemotherapy. However, its ability in limited-stage SCLC (LS-SCLC) should be evaluated extensively. Methods We retrospectively enrolled 497 patients diagnosed as LS-SCLC between 2015 and 2018, and clinical data included pretreatment lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), white blood cell count, and absolute neutrophil count levels were collected. According to the LIPI scores, the patients were stratified into low-risk (0 points) and high-risk (1-2 points). The correlations between LIPI and overall survival (OS) or progression-free survival (PFS) were analyzed by the Cox regression. Additionally, the propensity score matching (PSM) and inverse probability of treatment weight (IPTW) methods were used to reduce the selection and confounding bias. A nomogram was constructed using on multivariable Cox model. Results Two hundred fifty and 247 patients were in the LIPI high-risk group and low-risk group, and their median OS was 14.67 months (95% CI: 12.30-16.85) and 20.53 months (95% CI: 17.67-23.39), respectively. In the statistical analysis, High-risk LIPI was significantly against worse OS (HR = 1.377, 95%CI:1.114-1.702) and poor PFS (HR = 1.338, 95%CI:1.1-1.626), and the result was similar after matching and compensating with the PSM or IPTW method. A novel nomogram based on LIPI has a decent level of predictive power. Conclusion LIPI stratification was a significant factor against OS or PFS of LS-SCLC patients.

TI  - Emerging Strategies for the Treatment of Small Cell Lung Cancer A Review
T2  - JAMA ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Importance Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive disease that is characterized by rapid growth and the early development of metastases. Patients typically respond to initial chemotherapy but quickly experience relapse, resulting in a poor long-term outcome. Therapeutic innovations that substantially improve survival have historically been limited, and reliable, predictive biomarkers are lacking.Observations This review examines the biologic characteristics of SCLC, the current treatment landscape, and ongoing efforts to identify novel therapeutic targets. Ongoing research has advanced the understanding of molecular categories and the immunologic microenvironment of SCLC, which in turn has helped improve disease classification and staging. Recently, immunotherapy-based regimens have become available for the management of SCLC, with 2 programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 inhibitors approved in combination with chemotherapy for first-line treatment of extensive-stage disease. For second-line treatment, a novel alkylating agent, lurbinectedin, which inhibits oncogenic transcription, has been approved for use in patients with metastatic SCLC. Furthermore, a wide variety of therapies and innovative combination regimens are being continuously evaluated. Potential therapeutic strategies, including aurora kinase A inhibitors, polyadenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase inhibitors, ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related inhibitors, cyclin-dependent kinase 7 inhibitors, delta-like protein 3 agents, antiganglioside agents, CD47 inhibitors, and lysine-specific histone demethylase 1a inhibitors, are also being examined.Conclusions and Relevance Therapeutic optimization of SCLC remains a challenge, but recent trial results and drug approvals are encouraging. Advances in research have revealed critical information regarding biologic characteristics of the disease, which may lead to the identification of vulnerabilities and the development of new therapies. Further research focused on identifying biomarkers and evaluating innovative therapies will be paramount to improving treatment outcomes for patients with SCLC.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE KOREAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide despite major advances in platinum-based chemotherapy and targeted therapy based on activating driving mutations. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized the treatment paradigms in lung cancers. When used as a second-line or later treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ICIs improve overall survival and exhibit better safety profiles than the standard chemotherapeutic agent, docetaxel. In front-line treatment, ICI monotherapy is significantly associated with improved clinical outcomes and fewer adverse events than platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC, who express programmed death-ligand 1 in at least 50% of all tumor cells. Moreover, ICIs combined with platinum-based chemotherapy have become the standard first-line treatment for patients with metastatic NSCLC without sensitizing mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor gene or translocation of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene, regardless of programmed death-ligand 1 expression. Additionally, maintenance treatment using ICIs has also been demonstrated to improve clinical outcomes in patients with stage III unresectable NSCLC following chemoradiotherapy. Recently, the addition of ICIs to chemotherapy as the first-line treatment for extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer resulted in significantly longer overall survival and progression-free survival compared with chemotherapy alone. Although immune checkpoint inhibitors significantly improved overall survival and showed a durable response in lung cancer compared with platinum-based chemotherapy, we should foster further prospective studies to identify predictive biomarkers to determine those individuals who may benefit more from ICIs. It is also essential to overcome the development of drug resistance in patients treated with ICIs.

AB  - Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive, complex disease with a distinct biology that contributes to its poor prognosis. Management of SCLC is still widely limited to chemotherapy and radiation therapy, and research recruitment still poses a considerable challenge. Here, we review the current standard of care for SCLC and advances made in utilizing immunotherapy. We also highlight research in the development of targeted therapies and emphasize the importance of a team-based approach to make clinical advances. Building an integrative network between an academic site and community practice sites optimizes biomarker and drug target discovery for managing and treating a difficult disease like SCLC.

M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - AbstractLocoregional failure remains the principal mode of mortality in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas(HNSCCs) treated with conventional chemoradiation therapy over 7 weeks. Radiation dose escalation withhypofractionation has shown unparalleled local control in many other malignancies, such as non-small cell lungcancer, but has been stymied in HNSCCs due to toxicity concerns. MR-guided radiation therapy (MRgRT)allows for adaptive radiation dose escalation based on tumor response, which may improve therapeuticoutcomes while limiting toxicities.Our proposal, titled Dose-Escalated Hypofractionated Adaptive Radiotherapy (DEHART), evaluates a novelframework for radiation delivery using MRgRT with concurrent PD-1/PD-L1 targeted immunotherapy in patientswith advanced HNSCCs. Unlike conventional radiotherapy, DEHART modifies radiation dose using MRgRT byadapting the radiation plan weekly during the course of treatment, escalating radiation dose to residual tumorwhile deescalating radiation dose to areas of tumor regression. We hypothesize that DEHART will safelydeliver ablative radiation doses in 15 fractions over 3 weeks while limiting both toxicity and the effect of tumorrepopulation by resistant clonogens, thus resulting in an improved therapeutic ratio.We aim to test this hypothesis through a Phase I clinical trial with the following specific aims: (1) Determine themaximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the DEHART regimen delivered using MRgRT with concurrentimmunotherapy in a population of patients who are not candidates or unsuitable for definitive chemoradiationtherapy; (2) Evaluate the toxicity and functional outcomes of the DEHART regimen including changes inbaseline speech, swallow and quality of life; and (3) Assess the efficacy of DEHART and obtain volumetric andfunctional imaging correlates of efficacy using MRgRT to serve as hypothesis-generating data for future trialsof radiation dose adaptation. To determine the MTD of the DEHART regimen, we propose an 18 patient studyusing a modified Time-to Event Continual Reassessment (TITE-CRM) Phase I Design with three radiationdose levels delivered to regressing disease: 50 Gy in 15 fractions, 55 Gy in 15 fractions and 60 Gy in 15fractions.If DEHART is found to be safe and shows a signal of efficacy in this study, we will conduct a future Phase IItrial to compare this novel treatment strategy to standard-of care conventionally fractionated chemoradiation inpatients with locally advanced HNSCCs.

Unlike conventional radiotherapy, DEHART modifies radiation dose using MRgRT byadapting the radiation plan weekly during the course of treatment, escalating radiation dose to residual tumorwhile deescalating radiation dose to areas of tumor regression. We hypothesize that DEHART will safelydeliver ablative radiation doses in 15 fractions over 3 weeks while limiting both toxicity and the effect of tumorrepopulation by resistant clonogens, thus resulting in an improved therapeutic ratio.We aim to test this hypothesis through a Phase I clinical trial with the following specific aims: (1) Determine themaximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the DEHART regimen delivered using MRgRT with concurrentimmunotherapy in a population of patients who are not candidates or unsuitable for definitive chemoradiationtherapy; (2) Evaluate the toxicity and functional outcomes of the DEHART regimen including changes inbaseline speech, swallow and quality of life; and (3) Assess the efficacy of DEHART and obtain volumetric andfunctional imaging correlates of efficacy using MRgRT to serve as hypothesis-generating data for future trialsof radiation dose adaptation. To determine the MTD of the DEHART regimen, we propose an 18 patient studyusing a modified Time-to Event Continual Reassessment (TITE-CRM) Phase I Design with three radiationdose levels delivered to regressing disease: 50 Gy in 15 fractions, 55 Gy in 15 fractions and 60 Gy in 15fractions.If DEHART is found to be safe and shows a signal of efficacy in this study, we will conduct a future Phase IItrial to compare this novel treatment strategy to standard-of care conventionally fractionated chemoradiation inpatients with locally advanced HNSCCs.

TI  - Neoadjuvant and consolidation immuno-oncology therapy in stage III non-small cell lung cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF THORACIC DISEASE
M3  - Review
AB  - Lung cancer continues to be the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Recently, immunotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has emerged as a powerful treatment option for advanced lung cancer. The relative success of programmed death 1 (PD-1) and/or programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibodies in metastatic disease have increased interest in expanding their use to earlier stage NSCLC. The complex and diverse nature of stage III disease also invites the incorporation of immunotherapy into treatment plans in both the neoadjuvant and consolidation settings. Currently available data of anti-PD-(L)1 therapies in stage III NSCLC are limited. However, interim results from two studies are encouraging: a phase II neoadjuvant nivolumab trial demonstrated early signals of efficacy, and the phase III PACIFIC trial of durvalumab recently showed significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS). Preliminary results for the phase II DETERRED trial of durvalumab have also been reported. Many studies are testing anti-PD-(L)1 therapies in the neoadjuvant and consolidation settings for stage III NSCLC, and will be discussed. As these studies mature they may provide further treatment options in management of stage III NSCLC.

TI  - Matching by OS Prognostic Score to Construct External Controls in Lung Cancer Clinical Trials
T2  - CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY & THERAPEUTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - External controls (eControls) leverage historical data to create non-randomized control arms. The lack of randomization can result in confounding between the experimental and eControl cohorts. To balance potentially confounding variables between the cohorts, one of the proposed methods is to match on prognostic scores. Still, the performance of prognostic scores to construct eControls in oncology has not been analyzed yet. Using an electronic health record-derived de-identified database, we constructed eControls using one of three methods: ROPRO, a state-of-the-art prognostic score, or either a propensity score composed of five (5Vars) or 27 covariates (ROPROvars). We compared the performance of these methods in estimating the overall survival (OS) hazard ratio (HR) of 11 recent advanced non-small cell lung cancer. The ROPRO eControls had a lower OS HR error (median absolute deviation (MAD), 0.072, confidence interval (CI): 0.036-0.185), than the 5Vars (MAD 0.081, CI: 0.025-0.283) and ROPROvars eControls (MAD 0.087, CI: 0.054-0.383). Notably, the OS HR errors for all methods were even lower in the phase III studies. Moreover, the ROPRO eControl cohorts included, on average, more patients than the 5Vars (6.54%) and ROPROvars cohorts (11.7%). The eControls matched with the prognostic score reproduced the controls more reliably than propensity scores composed of the underlying variables. Additionally, prognostic scores could allow eControls to be built on many prognostic variables without a significant increase in the variability of the propensity score, which would decrease the number of matched patients.

TI  - The analysis of the efficacy and safety of stereotactic body radiotherapy with sequential immune checkpoint inhibitors in the management of oligoprogressive advanced non-small cell lung cancer
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: No standardized treatment strategy exists for managing oligoprogression during maintenance therapy in driver -negative advanced non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Similarly, a uniform response to oligoprogression during maintenance therapy using immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has not been established. Consequently, our investigation focused on assessing the efficacy and safety of employing stereotactic total body radiotherapy in conjunction with ICIs to address oligoprogression in advanced NSCLC. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients diagnosed with driver -negative advanced NSCLC who received stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in combination with ICIs to manage oligoprogressive lesions within the period from October 2018 to October 2023 at our institution. Oligoprogression, defined as progression occurring in three or fewer disease sites, was the focus of our investigation. Our assessment encompassed various parameters including the local control rate (LCR), progression-free survival post-oligoprogression (PFS-P), overall survival post-oligoprogression (OS -P), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and the safety profile associated with SBRT followed by sequential ICIs after oligoprogression. Results: A total of 15 patients were enrolled in this study, all at stage IV, with 12 (80%) receiving a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma. Before oligoprogression, 11 (73.3%) patients had undergone immunotherapy. Following the treatment of oligoprogressed lung cancer with SBRT sequential ICIs, the median PFS-P and OS -P were 8 months (95% CI: 2.7-13.3) and 12 months (95% CI: 7.3-16.7), respectively. Additionally, the median PFS and OS were 26 months (95% CI: 8.0-44.0) and 30 months (not reached), respectively. The median local control (LC) of 15 oligoprogressed lesions was 13 months (95% CI: 5.3-20.2), with a 1 -year LCR of 77.9%. Notably, patients with a performance status (PS) score of less than 2 demonstrated a more favorable survival benefit. Conclusions: Stereotactic systemic radiation therapy, combined with sequential ICIs, enhances both LC and survival in advanced NSCLC characterized by oligoprogression and negative driver gene mutations. This approach also exhibits the potential to postpone the transition between systemic chemotherapy regimens. Manageable adverse reactions were observed, with the absence of grade 4 reactions.

TI  - Thoracic radiotherapy for extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer: what is the optimal dose and timing?
T2  - JOURNAL OF RADIATION ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a neuroendocrine tumor that represents about 12-20% of all lung cancers. Most of the SCLC patients present with extensive-stage (ES) disease. Primary therapy for ES-SCLC is 4-6 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy (CT) followed by prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in selected cases. Although the response rate to CT is approximately 60-70%, median survival times are very limited. The main problem of ES-SCLC patients after CT is intra-thoracic tumor recurrence since 75% of the patients had persisting intra-thoracic disease after CT, and approximately 90% of the patients had intra-thoracic progressive disease within the first year after diagnosis. Such high rate of intra-thoracic disease progression explains the need of local treatment in selected patients. There are three randomized studies and two meta-analyses evaluating the role of thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) in patients with ES-SCLC who responded to CT. Two of the randomized trials and one of the meta-analyses showed survival benefit of TRT. According to the results of relevant studies, the patients who responded to CT and have intra-thoracic residual disease after CT, who had limited metastatic sites (<= 2), and who have good performance status and limited weight loss have more benefit from TRT. We need novel studies evaluating the optimal dose fractionation schedules, optimal timing of RT, impact of time interval between RT and CT, immunotherapy and RT combinations, and number of CT cycles.

TI  - Autoantibodies Drive Heart Damage Caused by Concomitant Radiation and PD-1 Blockade
T2  - CANCER IMMUNOLOGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Concurrent PD-1 blockade and thoracic radiotherapy is being investigated in clinical trials for locally advanced, non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer, despite a potential overlapping risk of cardiotoxicity. Our prior studies demonstrate that cardiotoxicity from concurrent cardiac irradiation and anti- PD-1 administration in a mouse model is CD8+ T-cell dependent. The objective of this study was to determine whether humoral immunity contributed to the observed cardiac tissue damage, as measured by creatine kinase MB and cardiac troponin 1 release and decline in cardiac function. In the current study, we demonstrate the presence of cardiac autoantibodies, which were essential for the occurrence of cardiotoxicity from the combined therapy. Mice subjected to cardiac irradiation, while being treated with anti-PD-1, developed high levels of antibodies that reacted with cardiac tissues in vivo and cardiac antigens in vitro. More-over, mice deficient in B cells were protected against cardiotoxi-city, whereas the transfer of autoantibody-containing sera from mice that had received combined treatment reproduced the same pathologic phenotype in mice exposed to cardiac irradiation but was not observed in normal recipients. The cardiotoxic effect of the sera, which associated with CD8+ T-cell accumulation in cardiac tissue, was limited by IgG depletion. In conclusion, concurrent cardiac irradiation and PD-1 blockade leads to production of cardiac autoantibodies, likely due to antigen exposure within the irradiated cardiac tissues, which play a key role in the resulting cardiotoxicity.

TI  - Locally-advanced non-small cell lung cancer: shall immunotherapy be a new chance?
T2  - JOURNAL OF THORACIC DISEASE
M3  - Review
AB  - Locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents approximately one third of presentations at diagnosis. Most patients are judged non-surgical due to disease extension, and chemo-radiotherapy still represents the standard therapeutic option, with unsatisfactory results in terms of overall survival (OS) despite advances in staging and radiation therapy planning and delivery. Immunotherapy, and in particular immune-checkpoint inhibitors targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis, gained wide popularity for NSCLC in light of the positive findings of several trials in metastatic disease. Stage III unresectable NSCLC is a remarkably interesting setting for the combined use of chemo-radiation and immunotherapy, also considering the multiple experimental evidences in favor of a synergistic effect between radiation and immune checkpoint inhibitors, with the potential of enhancing immuno-modulating effects and overcoming resistance. We here summarized the biological rationale and the initial clinical experiences testing for this combination, and we briefly discussed ongoing trials and future options in this field.

TI  - The evolving use of pembrolizumab in combination treatment approaches for non-small cell lung cancer
T2  - EXPERT REVIEW OF RESPIRATORY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The immune checkpoint inhibitor, pembrolizumab, has revolutionized the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It is currently approved and widely used in patients with advanced NSCLC whose tumors have no EGFR or ALK genomic aberrations that express PD-L1 as single-agent treatment and irrespective of PD-L1 expression in combination with platinum-based doublet chemotherapy in the first-line setting. Areas covered: The authors have reviewed articles discussing pembrolizumab and NSCLC in MEDLINE between July 2013 to August 2019 and focus on recent advances in combining pembrolizumab with chemotherapy, radiotherapy and other novel agents in various stages of NSCLC. Expert opinion: Although pembrolizumab has revolutionized the treatment of advanced NSCLC, only a subset of patients benefit from single-agent therapy. Numerous trials combining pembrolizumab with chemotherapy and radiation have shown benefit and a large spectrum of novel combination strategies are being explored for improved synergies. In addition to PD-L1 tumor proportion score, validation of other biomarkers would be beneficial in stratifying patients and improving the predictive value of combining immune check point inhibitors and chemotherapy.

M3  - Review
AB  - Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is characterized by aggressive proliferation kinetics, early development of distant metastasis, and an overall dismal prognosis. Addition of the PD-L1 antibodies atezolizumab and durvalumab to platinum-/etoposide-based chemotherapy improves overall survival and represents the first change in therapeutic standards for almost 30 years in metastasized SCLC (stage IV or extensive disease [ED] according to the Veterans Administration Lung Study Group [VALG]). Although the numeric gains in median overall survival are limited (approximately 3 months), the addition of a PD-L1 antibody led to a clinically relevant increase in 3-year overall survival from 5.8 to 17.6%. Therefore, anti-PD-L1-based immunochemotherapy represents the current standard for ED-SCLC and should be applied irrespective of PD-L1 expression and other biomarkers. Standard of care in curatively treatable SCLC limited to the hemithorax (limited stage [LD] according to VALG) remains is accelerated concurrent chemoradiotherapy. The recently presented findings of the ADRIATIC study demonstrate a benefit from consolidation therapy with the PD-L1 antibody durvalumab. A corresponding expansion of the drug's approval can be expected. In conclusion, treatment of SCLC remains a challenge and improvements in therapeutic standards are much slower than those seen in NSCLC.

T2  - EXPERT REVIEW OF ANTICANCER THERAPY
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction The ideal management of patients with unresectable non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is still developing. Unresectable NSCLC has a high mortality rate and poor prognosis. The development of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and molecular-targeted therapies has been a breakthrough in the treatment. The correct treatment of this patient population is crucial to maximize the clinical benefits without compromising quality of life (QOL). Areas covered We review the chemoradiotherapies, cytotoxic chemotherapies, immunotherapies, and molecular-targeted therapies available for unresectable NSCLC, focusing on their effects on overall survival, progression-free survival, and QOL. Expert opinion Although cure is the ultimate goal of cancer treatment, it is often difficult to achieve in advanced NSCLC. Biomarker surveillance techniques, such as next-generation sequencing, have made it possible to provide the most appropriate treatment for each patient. This has led to clinically-meaningful improvements in therapies for unresectable NSCLC. The development of new molecular-targeted therapies and the establishment of treatment for patients who acquired drug resistance after initial treatment have a positive impact on patients' long-term survival. ICIs lead the long-term survival that can be considered a cure of some patients with advanced NSCLC, but such curative survival is difficult to achieve with cytotoxic chemotherapies and molecular-targeted therapies.

TI  - Parallel explorations in LA-NSCLC: Chemoradiation dose-response optimisation considering immunotherapy and cardiac toxicity sparing
T2  - RADIOTHERAPY AND ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and purpose: Chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for locally-advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC) has undergone advances, including increased overall survival (OS) when combined with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), and using cardiac-sparing techniques to reduce the radiotoxicity. This research investigated 1) how radiotherapy schedules can be optimised with CRT-ICB schemes, and 2) how cardiac-sparing might change the OS for concurrent CRT (cCRT). Methods and materials: Survival data and dosimetric indices were sourced from published studies, with 2-year OS standardised and the hazard ratio of mean heart dose (MHD) against radiotoxicity tabulated in purpose. A published CRT dose-response model was selected, then modified with ICB and cardiac-sparing hypotheses. Models were maximum likelihood fitted, then visualised the prediction outcomes after bootstrapping. Results: The modelled 2-year OS rate of cCRT-ICB reached 71 % (95 % confidence intervals, CI 62 %, 84 %) and 66 % (95 % CI: 53 %, 81 %) for stage IIIA and IIIB/C, respectively, given 60 Gy in 2 Gy-per-fraction. 60 Gy in 30 fractions remained the best schedule for cCRT-ICB, whereas modest dose de-escalation to 55 Gy only reduced the OS in 2 %. Sequential CRT (sCRT)-ICB provided 6 % OS increases versus the best OS rate achieved by sCRT alone. Photon MHD-sparing achieved a 5-10 % increase in modelled 2-year OS, with protons providing a further roughly 5-10 % increase. Conclusion: Neither dose-escalation nor de-escalation relative to 60 Gy in 30 fractions influenced the survival with cCRT-ICB, while 5 Gy dose de-escalation might benefit patients with heavily irradiated organs at risk. Cardiac-sparing improved OS, and protons provided advantages for tumours anatomically overlapped or lay below the heart.

T2  - TRANSLATIONAL LUNG CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common cause of cancer mortality. Although a significant proportion of patients can be cured with surgery, with or without adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiation, a significant proportion of patients will fail, particularly distantly. Over fifty percent of patients present with stage IV disease. There are multiple forms of immunotherapy available including T-cell transfer, cytokine therapy, and oncolytic viruses. Checkpoint inhibitors have shown tremendous activity in NSCLC and are currently under intense study given promising data on response. Immunotherapy and radiation therapy (RT) both show significant immune editing activity in NSCLC that may allow the innate and adaptive immune system to help control systemic disease by both radiosensitization and a sustained systemic immune response. Multiple clinical trials are underway exploring the role of adjuvant or neoadjuvant immunotherapy in operable NSCLC. A substantial amount of progress is to be made in terms of optimizing radiation dose and fractionation, immunotherapy type and dose, and integrating both to best realize the benefits of immunotherapy and radiation in operable lung cancer.

TI  - Comparison of Carboplatin With Cisplatin in Small Cell Lung Cancer in US Veterans
T2  - JAMA NETWORK OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - IMPORTANCE The current standard of care for the treatment of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is concurrent chemoradiation for patients with limited-stage SCLC (LS-SCLC) and chemoimmunotherapy for extensive-stage SCLC (ES-SCLC). The backbone of chemotherapy regimens in both is a platinum-etoposide doublet: cisplatin is traditionally the preferred platinum agent in the curative intent setting, whereas carboplatin is preferred in ES-SCLC because of its favorable toxicity profile.OBJECTIVE To determine whether cisplatin is associated with better survival outcomes than carboplatin in treating LS-SCLC and ES-SCLC.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this cohort study, data were compiled from the National Veterans Affairs Central Cancer Registry for patients with SCLC who received platinum-based multiagent chemotherapy between 2000 and 2020 for ES-SCLC and 2000 and 2021 for LS-SCLC. Only patients with pathologically confirmed cases of LS-SCLC who received concurrent chemoradiation and ES-SCLC who received chemotherapy were included.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary end point was overall survival (OS). The secondary end points included OS by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, age, and laterality. Interval-censored Weibull and Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to estimate median OS and hazard ratios (HRs), respectively. Survival curves were compared by a Wald test.RESULTS A total of 4408 SCLC cases were studied. Most patients were White (3589 patients [81.4%]), male (4252 [96.5%]), and non-Hispanic (4142 [94.0%]); 2262 patients (51.3%) were 60 to 69 years old, followed by 1476 patients (33.5%) aged 70 years or older, 631 patients (14.3%) aged 50 to 59 years, and 39 patients (0.9%) aged 30 to 49 years. Among 2652 patients with ES-SCLC, 2032 were treated with carboplatin-based therapy and 660 received cisplatin; the median OS was 8.45 months (95% CI, 7.75-9.20 months) for cisplatin and 8.51 months (95% CI, 8.07-8.97 months) for carboplatin (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.91-1.12; P = .90). Subset analysis showed no survival difference between the 2 agents in different age or performance status groups except for patients aged 70 years and older, for whom the median OS was 6.36 months (95% CI, 5.31-7.56 months) for cisplatin and 8.47 months (95% CI, 7.79-9.19 months) for carboplatin (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.61-0.96; P = .02). Multivariable analysis of performance status and age did not show a significant difference in survival between the 2 groups (HR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.83-1.10; P = .54). Of 1756 patients with LS-SCLC, 801 received carboplatin, and 1018 received cisplatin. The median OS was 26.92 months (95% CI, 25.03-28.81 months) for cisplatin and 25.58 months (95% CI, 23.64-27.72 months) for carboplatin (HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.94-1.16; P = .46). The median OS was not significantly different between 2 agents according to cancer stage (I-III), performance status, and age groups. A multivariable analysis of factors associated with OS accounting for stage (I-III), performance status, and age did not demonstrate a significant difference in survival between carboplatin and cisplatin in patients with LS-SCLC (HR, 0.995; 95% CI, 0.86-1.15; P = .95).CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Cisplatin is not associated with a survival advantage over carboplatin among patients with either ES-SCLC or LS-SCLC, irrespective of performance status and age. The favorable toxicity profile of carboplatin and comparable OS support its use in both LS-SCLC and ES-SCLC in clinical practice and may allow more room for combination with novel treatment strategies in clinical trials.

TI  - Ipilimumab plus nivolumab and chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery in patients with resectable and borderline resectable T3-4N0-1 non-small cell lung cancer: the INCREASE trial
T2  - BMC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The likelihood of a tumor recurrence in patients with T3-4N0-1 non-small cell lung cancer following multimodality treatment remains substantial, mainly due distant metastases. As pathological complete responses (pCR) in resected specimens are seen in only a minority (28-38%) of patients following chemoradiotherapy, we designed the INCREASE trial (EudraCT-Number: 2019-003454-83; Netherlands Trial Register number: NL8435) to assess if pCR rates could be further improved by adding short course immunotherapy to induction chemoradiotherapy. Translational studies will correlate changes in loco-regional and systemic immune status with patterns of recurrence.Methods/design This single-arm, prospective phase II trial will enroll 29 patients with either resectable, or borderline resectable, T3-4N0-1 NSCLC. The protocol was approved by the institutional ethics committee. Study enrollment commenced in February 2020.On day 1 of guideline-recommended concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT), ipilimumab (IPI, 1 mg/kg IV) and nivolumab (NIVO, 360 mg flat dose IV) will be administered, followed by nivolumab (360 mg flat dose IV) after 3 weeks. Radiotherapy consists of once-daily doses of 2 Gy to a total of 50 Gy, and chemotherapy will consist of a platinum-doublet. An anatomical pulmonary resection is planned 6 weeks after the last day of radiotherapy. The primary study objective is to establish the safety of adding IPI/NIVO to pre-operative CRT, and its impact on pathological tumor response. Secondary objectives are to assess the impact of adding IPI/NIVO to CRT on disease free and overall survival. Exploratory objectives are to characterize tumor inflammation and the immune contexture in the tumor and tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLN), and to explore the effects of IPI/NIVO and CRT and surgery on distribution and phenotype of peripheral blood immune subsets.Discussion The INCREASE trial will evaluate the safety and local efficacy of a combination of 4 modalities in patients with resectable, T3-4N0-1 NSCLC. Translational research will investigate the mechanisms of action and drug related adverse events.

TI  - The Efficacy and Safety of Neoadjuvant Immunotherapy in Patients with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: After the success of immunotherapy in the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the benefit of neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy was compared with chemotherapy for localized NSCLC in several trials. However, the available studies had variable study designs, and study cohorts had limited follow-up times. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the benefit of adding immunotherapy to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with localized NSCLC. Methods: We conducted a systematic review using Pubmed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases for studies published until 5 December 2023. This protocol was registered in the PROSPERO database (Registration Number: CRD42023466337). We performed the meta-analyses with the generic inverse-variance method with a fixed effects model. Results: Overall, 7 studies encompassing 2993 patients were included in the analyses. The use of neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy was associated with a 41% reduction in the risk of progression or death compared to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (HR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.52-0.66, p < 0.0001) and a lower risk of death (HR: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.55-0.82, p < 0.0001). The neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy improved pCR rates compared to chemotherapy (21.8% vs. 3.8%, OR: 7.04, 95% CI: 5.23-9.47, p < 0.0001), while high-grade adverse events were higher with neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy (OR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.02-1.36, p = 0.0300). Conclusions: The available evidence demonstrates a statistically significant and clinically meaningful event-free survival benefit and possibly an overall survival benefit with neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy with a slight increase in high-grade toxicities.

M3  - Review
AB  - SCLC remains an aggressive, deadly cancer with only modest effect on survival from standard chemotherapy. However, with the advent of immunotherapy and comprehensive genomic and transcriptomic profiling, multiple new targets are showing promise in the clinical arena, and just recently programmed death ligand 1 inhibition has been shown to improve the efficacy of standard chemotherapy in extended-disease SCLC. Our increasing understanding of the interactions between different pathways will enable more tailored immunotherapy and targeted therapies based on specific biomarkers and rational combinations. Here we discuss the preclinical and clinical strides in 2017 and 2018 that put us on the threshold of a new era in therapeutics and will, it is hoped, translate into significant improvements in survival.

T2  - JOURNAL OF LAPAROENDOSCOPIC & ADVANCED SURGICAL TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. An increasing understanding of relevant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) biomarkers has led to the recent development of molecular-targeted therapies and immune checkpoint inhibitors that have revolutionized treatment for patients with advanced and metastatic disease. The purpose of this review is to provide surgeons with a state-of-the-art understanding of the current medical and surgical treatment trends and their implications in the future of management of NSCLC.Materials and Methods: A systematic search of PubMed was conducted to identify English language articles published between January 2010 and March 2024 focusing on molecular markers, tumor targeting, and immunotherapy in the diagnosis and treatment of NSCLC. Case series, observational studies, randomized trials, guidelines, narrative reviews, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses were included.Results: There is now increasing data to suggest that molecular-targeted therapies and immune therapies have a role in the neoadjuvant setting. Advances in intraoperative imaging allow surgeons to perform increasingly parenchymal-sparing lung resections without compromising tumor margins. Liquid biopsies can noninvasively detect targetable mutations in cancer cells and DNA from a blood draw, potentially allowing for earlier diagnosis, personalized therapy, and long-term monitoring for disease recurrence.Conclusions: The management of NSCLC has advanced dramatically in recent years fueled by a growing understanding of the cancer biology of NSCLC. Advances in medical therapies, surgical techniques, and diagnostic and surveillance modalities continue to evolve but have already impacted current treatment strategies for NSCLC, which are encompassed in this review.

TI  - CheckMate 73L: A Phase 3 Study Comparing Nivolumab Plus Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy Followed by Nivolumab With or Without Ipilimumab Versus Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy Followed by Durvalumab for Previously Untreated, Locally Advanced Stage III Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer
T2  - CLINICAL LUNG CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The 5 year survival rate for patients with locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) not amenable for definitive resection with historical standard-of-care concurrent chemoradiotherapy (cCRT) ranges from 15% to 32%. cCRT primes anti-tumor immunity and also upregulates programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1), providing a rationale for combining an immune checkpoint inhibitor with cCRT to improve outcomes. In the PACIFIC trial, consolidation therapy with the PD-L1 inhibitor durvalumab improved progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) vs. placebo in patients with stage III NSCLC who did not have disease progression after cCRT. CheckMate73L (NCT04026412), a randomized phase 3 study, evaluates the efficacy of nivolumab plus cCRT followed by nivolumab with or without ipilimumab vs. cCRT followed by durvalumab for untreated, stage III NSCLC. Patients and Methods: Patients with untreated, stage III NSCLC will be randomized 1:1:1 to nivolumab plus cCRT followed by nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab (Arm A) or nivolumab alone (Arm B); or cCRT followed by durvalumab (Arm C). Primary endpoints are PFS and OS (Arm A vs. Arm C). Secondary endpoints include additional analyses of PFS and OS (Arm A vs. Ar m B; Ar m B vs. Ar m C), as well as objective response rate, complete response rate, time to response, duration of response, time to death or distant metastases, and safety and tolerability. Recruitment began on August 20, 2019, and the estimated primary completion date is October 17, 2022.

TI  - The Integration of Radiotherapy with Immunotherapy for the Treatment of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
T2  - CLINICAL CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Five-year survival rates for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) range from 14% to 49% for stage I to stage IIIA disease, and are <5% for stage IIIB/IV disease. Improvements have been made in the outcomes of patients with NSCLC due to advancements in radiotherapy (RT) techniques, the use of concurrent chemotherapy with RT, and the emergence of immunotherapy as first-and second-line treatment in the metastatic setting. RT remains the mainstay treatment in patients with inoperable early-stage NSCLC and is given concurrently or sequentially with chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced unresectable disease. There is emerging evidence that RT not only provides local tumor control but also may influence systemic control. Multiple preclinical studies have demonstrated that RT induces immunomodulatory effects in the local tumor microenvironment, supporting a synergistic combination approach with immunotherapy to improve systemic control. Immunotherapy options that could be combined with RT include programmed cell death-1/programmed cell death ligand-1 blockers, as well as investigational agents such as OX-40 agonists, toll-like receptor agonists, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 inhibitors, and cytokines. Here, we describe the rationale for the integration of RT and immunotherapy in patients with NSCLC, present safety and efficacy data that support this combination strategy, review planned and ongoing studies, and highlight unanswered questions and future research needs.

TI  - Immunotherapy in unresectable stage III non-small-cell lung cancer: state of the art and novel therapeutic approaches
T2  - ANNALS OF ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The standard of care for patients with stage III non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) followed by 1 year of adjuvant durvalumab. Despite the survival benefit granted by immunotherapy in this setting, only 1/3 of patients are alive and disease free at 5 years. Novel treatment strategies are under development to improve patient outcomes in this setting: different anti-programmed cell death protein 1/programmed death-ligand 1 [anti-PD-(L)1] antibodies after CCRT, consolidation immunotherapy after sequential chemoradiotherapy, induction immunotherapy before CCRT and immunotherapy concurrent with CCRT and/or sequential chemoradiotherapy. Cross-trial comparison is particularly challenging in this setting due to the different timing of immunotherapy delivery and different patients' inclusion and exclusion criteria. In this review, we present the results of clinical trials investigating immune therapy in unresectable stage III NSCLC and discuss in-depth their biological rationale, their pitfalls and potential benefits. Particular emphasis is placed on the potential mechanisms of synergism between chemotherapy, radiation therapy and different monoclonal antibodies, and how this affects the tumor immune microenvironment. The designs and questions tackled by ongoing clinical trials are also discussed. Last, we address open questions and unmet clinical needs, such as the necessity for predictive biomarkers (e.g. radiomics and circulating tumor DNA). Identifying distinct subsets of patients to tailor anticancer treatment is a priority, especially in a heterogeneous disease such as stage III NSCLC.

TI  - Surgery after neoadjuvant immunotherapy in patients with resectable non-small cell lung cancer
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL LUNG CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Surgery is the standard of care for patients with operable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, as a single modality, surgery for early stage or locally advanced NSCLC remains associated with high rates of local and distant recurrence. The addition of neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy has modestly improved outcomes. While systemic therapy paired with surgery for other malignancies such as breast cancer have resulted in far better outcomes for equivalent stage designations, outcome improvements for operable NSCLC have lagged in part as a result of trials where adjuvant chemotherapy seemed to incur harm for stage IA patients and only modest survival benefit for stage IB-IIIA patients (AJCC 7th ed.). In recent years, immunotherapy for NSCLC has emerged as a systemic therapy with significant benefit over traditional chemotherapy regimens. These advances with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have opened the door to administering peri-operative immunotherapy for operable NSCLC. As a result, a great multitude of studies investigating the use of immunotherapy in combination with surgery for NSCLC as well as several other malignancies have emerged. In this review, we outline the rationale for neoadjuvant immunotherapy in the treatment of operable NSCLC and summarize the available evidence that include preoperative ICI as a single modality or in combination with systemic agents and/or radiotherapy. Further, we summarize how such treatment trajectories open multiple unique windows of opportunity for scientific discovery and potential therapeutic gains for these vulnerable patients.

TI  - Study Design and Rationale for Espera Trial: A Multicentre, Randomized, Phase II Clinical Trial Evaluating the Potential Efficacy of Adding SBRT to Pembrolizumab-Pemetrexed Maintenance in Responsive or Stable Advanced Non-Squamous NSCLC After Chemo-Immunotherapy Induction
T2  - CLINICAL LUNG CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Improvement in radiotherapy techniques and expected outcomes, as well as in understanding the underlying biological mechanisms contributing to its action (immunomodulation in primis), led to the integration of this therapeutical approach in the current management of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), not only in oncogene-driven tumors, but also in non-oncogene addicted NSCLC where the combination of platinum-based chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab represents nowadays the pivotal strategy. In this light, we have designed a randomized phase II (ESPERa) trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of adding Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) to pembrolizumab-pemetrexed maintenance in advanced NSCLC patients experiencing disease response or stability after chemo-immunotherapy induction. Patients and Methods: Advanced non-oncogene addicted NSCLC patients with ECOG performance status of 0 or 1, who obtained disease response or stability after 4 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab will be randomized 2:1 to receive pembrolizumab-pemetrexed maintenance plus SBRT vs pembrolizumab-pemetrexed alone. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS). Concomitant translational researches will be performed to identify potential prognostic and/or predictive biomarkers, as well as to analyze and monitor tumour microenvironment and tumor-host interactions. Conclusions: Although available data suggest the safety and efficacy of combining immunotherapy and radiotherapy, their systematic integration in the current first-line landscape still remains to be explored. If the pre-planned endpoints of the ESPERa trial will be achieved, the addition of SBRT to pembrolizumab-pemetrexed maintenance as a strategy to consolidate and ideally improve the awaited benefit could be considered as a promising strategy in NSCLC undergoing first-line therapy, as well as an interesting approach to be evaluated in other disease setting, as well as in other oncological malignancies where immunotherapy represents nowadays the standard-of-care.

TI  - Antitumor effects of cocultured dendritic cells and cytokine-induced killer cells on human non-small cell lung cancer through EGFR signaling pathway
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The death rates of lung cancer have ranked first in the world. Many patients are at advanced stage when diagnosed; therefore, they miss optimal operative period. And some patients cannot endure radiotherapy or chemotherapy. The present study investigated the antitumor effects of cocultured dendritic cells and cytokine-induced killer cells on human non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and the potential underlying mechanisms. Antitumor effects of cocultured dendritic cells and cytokine-induced killer cells suppressed the cell proliferation, increased the cytotoxicity, induced the apoptosis and promoted caspase-3/9 activities in NSCLC. Meanwhile, the effects of cocultured dendritic cells and cytokine-induced killer cells suppressed the protein expression of TGF-beta, inhibited IL-4 activity, enhanced IL-10 and PGE-2 activities and activated the protein expression of IFN-gamma and suppressed EGFR protein expression of NSCLC. This study provides a theoretical and experimental basis for clinical immunotherapy using the effect of cocultured dendritic cells and cytokine-induced killer cells on NSCLC through activating of caspases, IL-10 activity, PGE-2, IFN-gamma and EGFR expression, and suppression of IL-4 activity and TGF-beta protein expression.

TI  - Phase Ib study evaluating a self-adjuvanted mRNA cancer vaccine (RNActive®) combined with local radiation as consolidation and maintenance treatment for patients with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer
T2  - BMC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents a significant unmet medical need. Despite advances with targeted therapies in a small subset of patients, fewer than 20% of patients survive for more than two years after diagnosis. Cancer vaccines are a promising therapeutic approach that offers the potential for durable responses through the engagement of the patient's own immune system. CV9202 is a self adjuvanting mRNA vaccine that targets six antigens commonly expressed in NSCLC (NY-ESO-1, MAGEC1, MAGEC2, 5 T4, survivin, and MUC1).Methods/Design: The trial will assess the safety and tolerability of CV9202 vaccination combined with local radiation designed to enhance immune responses and will include patients with stage IV NSCLC and a response or stable disease after first-line chemotherapy or therapy with an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Three histological and molecular subtypes of NSCLC will be investigated (squamous and non-squamous cell with/without EGFR mutations). All patients will receive two initial vaccinations with CV9202 prior to local radiotherapy (5 GY per day for four successive days) followed by further vaccinations until disease progression. The primary endpoint of the study is the number of patients experiencing Grade >3 treatment-related adverse events. Pharmacodynamic analyses include the assessment of immune responses to the antigens encoded by CV9202 and others not included in the panel (antigen spreading) and standard efficacy assessments.Discussion: RNActive self-adjuvanted mRNA vaccines offer the potential for simultaneously inducing immune responses to a wide panel of antigens commonly expressed in tumors. This trial will assess the feasibility of this approach in combination with local radiotherapy in NSCLC patients.

TI  - Sequential chemo-hypofractionated RT versus concurrent standard CRT for locally advanced NSCLC: GRADE recommendation by the Italian Association of Radiotherapy and Clinical Oncology (AIRO)
T2  - RADIOLOGIA MEDICA
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction Almost 30% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients have locally advanced-stage disease. In this setting, definitive radiotherapy concurrent to chemotherapy plus adjuvant immunotherapy (cCRT + IO) is the standard of care, although only 40% of these patients are eligible for this approach. Aims A comparison between cCRT and hypofractionated radiotherapy regimens (hypo-fx RT) with the addition of sequential chemotherapy (sCHT) could be useful for future combinations with immunotherapy. We developed a recommendation about the clinical question of whether CHT and moderately hypo-fx RT are comparable to cCRT for locally advanced NSCLC Materials and methods The panel used GRADE methodology and the Evidence to Decision (EtD) framework. After a systematic literature search, five studies were eligible. We identified the following outcomes: progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), freedom from locoregional recurrence (FFLR), deterioration of quality of life (QoL), treatment-related deaths, severe G3-G4 toxicity, late pulmonary toxicity G3-G4, and acute esophageal toxicity G3-G4. Results The probability of OS and G3-G4 late lung toxicity seems to be worse in patients submitted to sCHT and hypo-fx RT. The panel judged unfavorable the balance benefits/harms. Conclusions The final recommendation was that sCHT followed by moderately hypo-fx RT should not be considered as an alternative to cCRT in unresectable stage III NSCLC patients.

TI  - Real-world comparison of chemo-immunotherapy and chemotherapy alone in the treatment of extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer
T2  - RESPIRATORY MEDICINE AND RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma responsible for 200,000 deaths per year worldwide. Platinum-etoposide-based chemotherapy has been the standard of treatment for the past 40 years, with an overall survival of 10 months. Since 2019, the addition of immunotherapy (atezolizumab or durvalumab) to chemotherapy has become the standard of care for first-line treatment of extensive-stage SCLC following the demonstration of an improvement in overall survival in phase 3 studies. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of chemo-immunotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone in a "real-world" setting. Methods: Retrospective observational study including patients undergoing first-line treatment for extensivestage SCLC between 2014 and 2022. We separated the study population into two arms (chemo-immunotherapy/chemotherapy). For each arm, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and serious side effects were collected. Associations between treatments and survival outcomes were adjusted for potential confounders. Consolidative palliative thoracic radiotherapy was introduced in the models as a time-dependent variable. Results: A total of 118 patients with a median age of 63 years were included. 65.2 % of patients were performance status 0 or 1. In univariate analysis, PFS and OS were not significantly different between the chemoimmunotherapy and chemotherapy alone groups (p = 0.70 and 0.24 respectively). In multivariate analysis, the addition of immunotherapy to chemotherapy was not significantly associated with better PFS (HR 0.76, IC (0.49 - 1.19), p = 0.23), but it was significantly associated with better OS (HR 0.61, IC (0.38 - 0.98), p = 0.04). Consolidative palliative thoracic radiotherapy (time-dependent variable), when applied (almost only in the chemotherapy alone group), was significantly associated with better PFS and OS. Discussion: In this real-world study, chemo-immunotherapy was associated with slightly better OS compared to chemotherapy alone as a first-line treatment in ES-SCLC patients in multivariate analysis, which is not explained by a benefit in PFS. However, consolidative palliative thoracic radiotherapy seems to be significantly associated with better OS and PFS, suggesting that we should also consider using it in patients receiving chemo-immunotherapy.

TI  - Venous thromboembolism incidence and risk factors associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors among patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer
T2  - JOURNAL FOR IMMUNOTHERAPY OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundVenous thromboembolism (VTE) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with lung cancer. Systemic therapies, such as chemotherapy (chemo), are associated with increased risk of VTE. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are a new standard of care for the treatment of lung cancer, but their association with VTE is not fully understood. We evaluated the incidence of VTE and risk factors for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (aNSCLC) treated with first-line ICI-based, chemo-based, or ICI+chemo regimens.MethodsThis retrospective cohort study used HealthCore Integrated Research Environment - Oncology data, an integrated database of administrative claims, coupled with clinical data from a cancer-care quality program. Patients with first-line treatment of stage IV non-small cell lung cancer from July 2014 to August 2020 were grouped based on three treatment types: ICI-based, chemo-based, or ICI+chemo. Patients with VTE before initiation of systemic treatment were excluded. Newly diagnosed VTE events were identified via inpatient and outpatient diagnosis codes. Cox proportional hazards models were used to investigate the factors associated with VTE risk.ResultsAmong 2299 eligible patients (ICI-based, n=605; chemo-based, n=1092; ICI+chemo, n=602) with a median follow-up of 9.1 months, the VTE incidence rates (95% CI) per 100 person-years were 17.8 (95% CI 16.0 to 19.5) overall, 13.5 (95% CI 10.6 to 16.5) for ICI-based, 18.0 (95% CI 15.5 to 20.5) for chemo-based, and 22.4 (95% CI 20.2 to 24.5) for ICI+chemo. The 6-month cumulative incidence of VTE was 8.1% for ICI-based, 10.9% for chemo-based, and 12.8% for ICI+chemo. Pulmonary embolism was most common, accounting for 63% of the VTE events. After controlling for baseline patient characteristics, the risk of VTE was 26% lower for ICI-based regimens than for chemo-based regimens (HR 0.74, p=0.03). There was no meaningful difference in the risk between ICI+chemo and chemo-based regimens (HR 1.12, p=0.36). Previous radiation and severe obesity (body mass index >= 40) were associated with VTE.ConclusionsVTE incidence rate per 100 person-years was common across regimens in patients with aNSCLC, but numerically lower for patients receiving ICI-based regimens compared with those receiving chemo-based and ICI+chemo regimens. VTE is a common complication of lung cancer, and there is a continued need for awareness of VTE as a comorbidity in this population.

AB  - The possible link between infection/inflammation/immune activation and a cancer patient's outcome from both a causative and outcome point of view has long been postulated. Substantial progress in the understanding of tumor-associated antigens/epitopes, immune cellular subpopulations, cytokine pathways/expression, the tumor microenvironment, and the balance between tumor-immune suppression and stimulation have been made over the past decade. This knowledge has heralded a new era of tumor immunotherapy utilizing vaccines, immune checkpoint inhibition, and oncolytic viruses. Despite significant progress in the molecular era now with targeted therapeutics such as EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors and ALK fusion protein inhibitors that have significantly improved the outcome of these specific lung cancer subpopulations, the overall 5year survival for all non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is still <20%. Unlike malignancies such as malignant melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, and neuroblastoma given their documented spontaneous remission rates lung cancer historically has been felt to be resistant to immune approaches likely related to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and/or lack of immune recognition. Defining responding populations, understanding the mechanism(s) underlying durable immune responses, and the role of chemotherapy, radiation, oncolytic viruses, and other tumor disrupting agents in augmenting immune responses have led to improved optimization of immune therapeutic strategies. The purpose of this review is to focus on the recent advances in lung immunotherapy with an emphasis on recent clinical trials in the last 5years in NSCLC.

M3  - Review
AB  - Surgical resection is the treatment of choice for patients with localized non-small cell lung cancer. However, the long-term survival rate of patients after such surgery is disappointing. Even in stage I patients who have undergone potentially curative operation, over 30% of them recur within five years. Most of the recurrences are caused by hematogenous metastases to the distant organs. However, all of the comparative study to evaluate postoperative adjuvant therapy, ie, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, or their combination, showed negative results, except for a few positive outcomes. To date, there is no evidence that pre- and postoperative adjuvant therapy have shown a favorable impact on survival of postoperative patients with stage I disease. LCSG has had reportedly favorable results on survival of stage II and III adenocarcinoma and large cell carcinoma by postoperative CAP-chemotherapy. Postoperative chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy showed no impact on survival of stage III patients who underwent surgical intervention. However, preoperative induction therapy (IT) using combination chemotherapy (with or without radiotherapy) has improved the survival of patients with resected stage III disease, although most reports are of phase II trial or interim results. It seems to be true that the IT can render an advanced lung cancer resectable and also can control pre-existing micro-metastases in the distant organs. However, randomized prospective trials are required for evaluating an impact on the survival rate of the advanced non-small cell lung cancer.

TI  - Effect and Tolerability of Immunotherapy in Patients with NSCLC with or without Brain Metastasis
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are increasingly used in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Most randomized clinical trials have excluded patients with brain metastasis (BM), and real-life patients with NSCLC who receive ICIs are not routinely scanned with magnetic resonance imaging (MR-C) of the brain prior to ICI. This means that there are no prospective data available on the prevalence of BM or on the rate of intracranial response (ICR) attributable to ICIs. To evaluate this along with the impact of BM on quality of life and overall survival, we used MR-C as a screening tool in 159 ICI-eligible patients with advanced NSCLC prior to first ICI. At the time of ICI initiation, 28% of patients had BM. Of those who received ICI without additional early local radiotherapy or surgery, 50% had intracranial response at their first MR-C assessment. Long-term survival of patients with BM was comparable to those without. Sparse data exist on immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) in NSCLC patients with brain metastasis (BM), especially for those with no local therapy (LT) (whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT), stereotactic RT (SRT) or neurosurgery) preceding ICI. Our aims were to investigate the prevalence of BM, rate of intracranial response (ICR), and survival and quality of life (QoL) in real-life patients with advanced NSCLC undergoing palliative ICI. This was a prospective non-randomized study (NCT03870464) with magnetic resonance imaging of the brain (MR-C) performed at baseline resulting in a clinical decision to administer LT or not. ICR evaluation (MR-C) at week 8-9 (mRECIST criteria) for group A (LT) and group B (untreated) was assessed. Change in QoL was assessed using EQ-5D-5L. Of 159 included patients, 45 (28%) had baseline BM. Median follow-up was 23.2 months (IQR 16.4-30.2). Of patients in group A (21) and B (16), 16/37 (43%) had symptomatic BM. ICR was 8/21, 38% (complete or partial response) for group A versus 8/16, 50% for group B. No statistical difference in median overall survival of patients with BM (group A: 12.3 (5.2-NR), group B: 20.5 months (4.9-NR)) and without (22.4 months (95% 16.2-26.3)) was obtained. Baseline QoL was comparable regardless of BM, but an improved QoL (at week 9) was found in those without BM. Patients with NSCLC and BM receiving ICI had long-term survival comparable to those without BM.

TI  - Immune Checkpoint Blockade for Advanced NSCLC: A New Landscape for Elderly Patients
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - The therapeutic scenario for elderly patients with advanced NSCLC has been limited to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Recently, a novel therapeutic approach based on targeting the immune-checkpoints has showed noteworthy results in advanced NSCLC. PD1/PD-L1 pathway is co-opted by tumor cells through the expression of PD-L1 on the tumor cell surface and on cells within the microenvironment, leading to suppression of anti-tumor cytolytic T-cell activity by the tumor. The success of immune-checkpoints inhibitors in clinical trials led to rapid approval by the FDA and EMA. Currently, data regarding efficacy and safety of ICIs in older subjects is limited by the poor number of elderly recruited in clinical trials. Careful assessment and management of comorbidities is essential to achieve better outcomes and limit the immune related adverse events in elderly NSCLC patients.

TI  - Modern era systemic therapies: Expanding concepts of cure in early and locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - Cure of cancer is a sensitive and multidimensional concept that is challenging to define, difficult to assert at the individual patient level, and often surrounded by controversy. The notion of cure in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has changed and continues to evolve with improvements in diagnosis and treatment. Targeted and immune therapies have recently entered the treatment landscape of stage I-III NSCLC. While some initial pivotal trials of such agents failed to improve survival, recently approved epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors (in EGFR-mutated NSCLC) and immune checkpoint inhibitors have shown delays in disease recurrence or progression and unprecedented survival gains compared to previous standards of care. Additional data is now emerging supporting the benefit of treatment strategies based on alternation-matched targeting (anaplastic lymphoma kinase [ALK] inhibition in ALK-altered disease) and immune checkpoint inhibition in stage I-III NSCLC. Similar to previous developments in the treatment of early and locally advanced NSCLC, it is expected that statistically significant and clinically meaningful trial-level benefits will translate into real-world benefits, including improvements in cure measures. Parallel advances in molecular testing (e.g., circulating tumor DNA analyses) are also allowing for a deeper and more comprehensive characterization of disease status and treatment response. Given the impact that curative-intent treatments have on survival, it is critical that various stakeholders, including clinicians and patients, are aware of new opportunities to pursue cure in stage I-III NSCLC.image

TI  - Clinical benefits of Livin peptide-loaded DCs/CIKs combined with chemotherapy in advanced non-small cell lung cancer
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous studies showed that Livin, a member of inhibitors of apoptosis protein (IAP), played an important role in drug and radiation resistance. When the expression of Livin was blocked, the sensitivity to both chemotherapy and radiotherapy was improved in lung cancer cells. A total of 79 patients diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were enrolled into the current study from Jan 2012 to Apr 2016. The Livin and MUC-1 groups received one-cycle autologous DCs/CIKs infusion on days 11 to 14 additionally. The clinical efficacy, immune index, KPS score and adverse events were compared among the three groups. Median progression-free survival (mPFS) in Livin and MUC-1 groups was significantly longer than that in Chemo group (195 and 211 vs 138 days, P < 0.05), and the objective response rate (ORR) in Livin and MUC-1 groups was significantly higher than that in Chemo group (23.1% and 22.2% vs 5.1%, P < 0.05). The Tetramer value after treatment in Livin group was significantly higher than that before treatment (4.07 +/- 3.77 vs 3.16 +/- 3.82, P < 0.05). The concentration of Livin antibody in patients' peripheral blood before and after treatment in Livin group had no significant difference (P > 0.05). As for KPS score, scarce decrease was found in Livin and MUC-1 groups after chemotherapy treatment (0.77 +/- 6.41 and 0.37 +/- 5.18, respectively). However, obvious decrease of KPS score (P < 0.039) was recorded in Chemo group (3.85 +/- 6.33). There was no significant difference in disease control rate (DCR), overall survival (OS), T cell subsets, cytokine levels (IFN-gamma and IL-2) and adverse events between the three groups (P > 0.05). Livin peptide could be a novel substitute to trigger cell immunity by loading DCs in combination with chemotherapy in NSCLC.

TI  - Real-World Analysis of Survival and Treatment Efficacy in Stage IIIA-N2 Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary This study focuses on Stage IIIA-N2 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which occurs when lung cancer has spread to lymph nodes in the centre of the chest but not to distant parts of the body. This type of cancer is difficult to treat, and survival rates remain low despite advances in therapy. The research is based on real-world data from Guy's Thoracic Cancer Database and aims to enhance our understanding of patient outcomes and identify important factors that impact survival and disease progression. By examining various treatment strategies, the study aims to offer insights that could help tailor treatment approaches to individual patients. The findings underscore the need for personalised care and the potential benefits of incorporating newer therapeutic options, ultimately leading to better survival outcomes for patients with this challenging form of lung cancer.Abstract Background: Stage IIIA-N2 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) poses a significant clinical challenge, with low survival rates despite advances in therapy. The lack of a standardised treatment approach complicates patient management. This study utilises real-world data from Guy's Thoracic Cancer Database to analyse patient outcomes, identify key predictors of overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS), and address the limitations of randomised controlled trials. Methods: This observational, single-centre, non-randomised study analysed 142 patients diagnosed with clinical and pathological T1/2 N2 NSCLC who received curative treatment from 2015 to 2021. Patients were categorised into three groups: Group A (30 patients) underwent surgery for clinical N2 disease, Group B (54 patients) had unsuspected N2 disease discovered during surgery, and Group C (58 patients) received radical chemoradiation or radiotherapy alone (CRT/RT) for clinical N2 disease. Data on demographics, treatment types, recurrence, and survival rates were analysed. Results: The median OS for the cohort was 31 months, with 2-year and 5-year OS rates of 60% and 30%, respectively. Group A had a median OS of 32 months, Group B 36 months, and Group C 25 months. The median DFS was 18 months overall, with Group A at 16 months, Group B at 22 months, and Group C at 17 months. Significant predictors of OS included ECOG performance status, lymphovascular invasion, and histology. No significant differences in OS were found between treatment groups (p = 0.99). Conclusions: This study highlights the complexity and diversity of Stage IIIA-N2 NSCLC, with no single superior treatment strategy identified. The findings underscore the necessity for personalised treatment approaches and multidisciplinary decision-making. Future research should focus on integrating newer therapeutic modalities and conducting multi-centre trials to refine treatment strategies. Collaboration and ongoing data collection are crucial for improving personalised treatment plans and survival outcomes for Stage IIIA-N2 NSCLC patients.

TI  - Active immunotherapy with 1E10 anti-idiotype vaccine in patients with small cell lung cancer -: Report of a phase I trial
T2  - CANCER BIOLOGY & THERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - 1E10 is an anti-idiotype murine monoclonal antibody (Ab2 MAb) specific to an Ab1 MAb which reacts with NeuGc - containing gangliosides, sulfatides and with antigens expressed in some human tumors. Preparations containing this Ab2 were capable to induce a strong anti - metastatic effect in tumor - bearing mice. We conducted a Phase I clinical trial to evaluate the toxicity and humoral immune response elicited by 1E10 vaccine in patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Eligible patients were those who after received chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy had partial or complete response to treatment. Patients received four biweekly injections with 2 mg of aluminum hydroxide - precipitated 1E10 MAb, then other six doses at 28 - day intervals, and later the patients who maintained a good performance status were reimmunized. Six patients with limited - stage disease and three with extensive - stage disease were enrolled in the study. Most of the patients who received at least four doses of 1E10 vaccine developed strong specific antibody responses against 1E10 MAb and NeuGc - GM3 ganglioside. Antibodies able to react with lung carcinoma tissue sections were detected in sera from vaccinated patients. A prolonged survival was observed in several patients treated with the anti - idiotype vaccine. No evidence of serious adverse effects was found.

TI  - The timing of durvalumab administration affects the risk of pneumonitis in patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - BMC CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - PurposeThe PACIFIC study has demonstrated that the administration of durvalumab following concurrent chemoradiotherapy can significantly improve both overall survival and progression-free survival rates in patients with locally advanced unresectable non-small cell lung cancer. While the latest NCCN guidelines recommend this combination regimen, they do not specify the optimal timing for administering durvalumab after completing radiotherapy. The PACIFIC study suggested initiating durvalumab within 42 days of completing radiotherapy, but early administration of the drug may increase the incidence of pneumonitis. Therefore, we conducted this study to investigate whether the time interval between completion of radiotherapy and initiation of durvalumab treatment is associated with the risk of pneumonitis (Grade >= 3), which is the primary endpoint, as well as progression-free survival, which is the secondary endpoint.MethodsA comprehensive search of clinical trials in PubMed and EMBASE was conducted up to March 2023 to identify clinical trials involving locally advanced unresectable non-small cell lung cancer patients who were treated with durvalumab following chemoradiotherapy. Meta-analysis was performed on single-arm studies to estimate the incidence of pneumonitis (Grade >= 3) and progression-free survival in all studies, as well as in studies that administered durvalumab within 42 days after completion of radiotherapy.ResultsThis meta-analysis consisted of nine studies with a total of 2560 patients. The analysis showed that the incidence of pneumonitis (Grade >= 3) was 5.36% [95%CI (0.03, 0.08), I2 = 18.41%, p = 0.29], while the 1-year progression-free survival rate was 57.91% [95%CI (0.53, 0.63), I2 = 10.57%, p = 0.35]. Furthermore, when the duration between completion of radiotherapy and initiation of durvalumab treatment was shorter than 42 days, the incidence of pneumonitis (Grade >= 3) was 4.12% [95%CI (0.02, 0.06), I2 = 0.00%, p = 0.56], with a 1-year progression-free survival rate of 61.03% [95%CI (0.51, 0.71), I2 = 59.06%, p = 0.09].ConclusionOverall, based on the available evidence, it appears that there is no significant increase in pneumonitis or decrease in progression-free survival (PFS) when the time interval is less than 42 days and a shorter interval between treatment sessions does not necessarily have a detrimental effect on the rate of pneumonitis. We recommend that clinicians carefully evaluate the specific circumstances of each patient to determine the optimal timing for initiating immunotherapy.

TI  - Novel Targets, Novel Treatments: The Changing Landscape of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Non-small cell lung cancer treatment has undergone a revolution in the past decade owing to the discovery of mutations that drive carcinogenesis and the development of molecular testing and treatments that act on them. Here, we detail the way in which lung cancer is currently diagnosed and treated in light of these developments. We focus on some of the key mutations for which targeted therapies have been developed and the trials that led to their approval. We hope to provide a comprehensive review of the current diagnosis and management of non-small cell lung cancer.Abstract: Treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has undergone a paradigm shift. Once a disease with limited potential therapies, treatment options for patients have exploded with the availability of molecular testing to direct management and targeted therapies to treat tumors with specific driver mutations. New in vitro diagnostics allow for the early and non-invasive detection of disease, and emerging in vivo imaging techniques allow for better detection and monitoring. The development of checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy has arguably been the biggest advance in lung cancer treatment, given that the vast majority of NSCLC tumors can be treated with these therapies. Specific targeted therapies, including those against KRAS, EGFR, RTK, and others have also improved the outcomes for those individuals bearing an actionable mutation. New and emerging therapies, such as bispecific antibodies, CAR T cell therapy, and molecular targeted radiotherapy, offer promise to patients for whom none of the existing therapies have proved effective. In this review, we provide the most up-to-date survey to our knowledge regarding emerging diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for lung cancer to provide clinicians with a comprehensive reference of the options for treatment available now and those which are soon to come.

TI  - Influence of the number and interval of treatment cycles on cytokine-induced killer cells and their adjuvant therapeutic effects in advanced non small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL IMMUNOPHARMACOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells have important therapeutic effects in adoptive cell transfer (ACT) for the treatment of various malignancies. In this study, we focused on in vitro expansion of CIK cells and their clinical efficacy in combination with chemotherapy in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Methods: A total of 64 patients with NSCLC (enrolled from 2011 to 2012), including 32 patients who received chemotherapy alone or with sequential radiotherapy (conventional treatment, control group) and 32 patients who received conventional treatment and sequential CIK infusion (study group), were retrospectively analyzed. The time to progression (TTP), overall survival (OS) and adverse effects were analyzed and the phenotype of lymphocytes in CIK population was also determined by flow cytometry.Results: After in vitro expansion, the average percentage of CIK cells was 26.35%. During the 54-month follow up, the median OS and rip were significantly longer in the study group than in the control group (P = 0.0189 and P = 0.0129, respectively). The median OS of the ACT >= 4 cycles subgroup was significantly longer than that of the ACT < 4 cycles subgroup (P = 0.0316). The percentage of CIK cells in patients who received >= 4 cycles of ACT was higher than that in patients treated with < 4 cycles of ACT (P = 0.0376). Notably, CIK cells were difficult to expand in vitro in some patients after the first ACT cycle but became much easier as the treatment cycles increased monthly. Longer treatment interval negatively impacted the expansion of CIK cells.Conclusions: Systematic immune levels can be increasingly boosted by reinfusion of ACT. Conventional treatment plus CIK cells is an effective therapeutic strategy to prevent progression and prolong survival of patients with advanced NSCLC.

TI  - Maintenance and Consolidation Therapy in Patients with Unresectable Stage III/IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
T2  - ONCOLOGIST
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally, lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality. Current chemotherapy combinations for the first-line treatment of advanced disease (stage IIIB with malignant pleural effusion/stage IV) and chemoradiotherapy regimens for the treatment of unresectable locally advanced disease (stage MA and IIIB without malignant pleural effusion) appear to have reached an efficacy plateau. The addition of new compounds including targeted agents to standard first-line cytotoxic doublets, administered concurrently and/or as maintenance therapy in patients who have not experienced disease progression after such treatment, has been shown to improve efficacy beyond this plateau in patients with advanced disease. However, to date, such approaches have been less successful in the treatment of patients with unresectable locally advanced stage III disease. The purpose of this review is to summarize the data from recent randomized phase III studies involving agents administered as maintenance or consolidation therapy in the treatment of unresectable stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A possible alternative approach to the use of cytotoxic or molecularly targeted agents in this setting is the administration of therapeutic anticancer vaccines, which are designed to stimulate a host immunological response against the tumor. Current data in relation to the potential of vaccine therapy for NSCLC are therefore also reviewed, with a particular focus on belagenpumatucel-L and L-BLP25 vaccines, which are currently undergoing phase III evaluation as maintenance therapies in patients with unresectable stage III/IV NSCLC who have tumor control following first-line therapy.

TI  - Clinical outcomes of immunotherapy continued beyond radiographic disease progression in older adult patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer
T2  - ONCOLOGY LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Immunotherapy is an effective and generally well-tolerated treatment strategy for older adult patients (aged >= 70 years) with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Unfortunately, most patients who receive immunotherapy eventually exhibit disease progression during treatment. The present study reports on a subset of older adult patients with advanced NSCLC who could effectively continue immunotherapy beyond radiographic disease progression due to perceived clinical benefit. Local consolidative radiotherapy may be used in select older adult patients to prolong the duration of immunotherapy they receive, with a particular consideration of their preexisting co-morbidities, performance status and tolerance of potential toxicities associated with combined modality therapy. However, prospective research is needed to determine which patients benefit most from the addition of local consolidative radiotherapy, including whether type of disease progression (i.e., sites of progression, pattern of progression) and/or extent of consolidation offered (i.e., complete or incomplete) impact clinical outcomes. Further research is also warranted to determine which patients would most benefit from the continuation of immunotherapy beyond documented radiographic disease progression.

AB  - In recent years, the five-year survival rate of patients with advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains low despite recent advances in surgery, irradiation, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy. Immunotherapy which utilizes the immune system to control and eradicate cancer is a viable treatment approach for malignancy. Immunotherapy in patients with lung cancer has made breakthrough progress recently. Novel immunotherapeutic agents, such as antigen-specific tumour vaccines, checkpoint inhibitors, etc, have all been evaluated in lung cancer, and some have shown prolonged survival time in phase II trials and III trails. The immune-related response criteria for the evaluation of antitumor responses with immunotherapeutic agents have been made. Now, immunotherapy will likely be a fundamentally new concept for the treatment of NSCLC.

TI  - Radiotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer in the immunotherapy era: the opportunity and challenge-a narrative review
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL LUNG CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Immunotherapy has radically changed the clinical management of patients with cancer in recent years. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) reversing the immunosuppressive effects of the tumor microenvironment are one type of immunotherapy, several of which are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as first-line treatments for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, response rates to ICIs are around 19-47% among patients with advanced NSCLC. As a result, the development of combined ICI and radiotherapy has begun with the aim of strengthening patients' antitumor immunity. Radiotherapy with substantial technological improvements not only achieves local tumor control through the induction of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage in irradiated regions, but also has the potential to mediate immunostimulatory effects that could result in tumor regression beyond irradiated regions. At present, numerous preclinical and clinical research are investigating the efficiency and safety of combining ICI with radiotherapy. The PACIFIC trial showed that combining chemoradiotherapy with ICI could improve clinical outcomes. In this review, we summarize the rationale for combining radiotherapy with immunotherapy. We also discuss the opportunities and challenges of combination therapy, including the timing of radiotherapy, optimal dose and fractionations, radiotherapy target and target volume, acquired resistance, patient selection, and radioimmunotherapy toxicity.

TI  - Surgery after Induction Targeted Therapy and Immunotherapy for Lung Cancer
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Simple SummaryFor patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or positive N1 nodes, multimodality treatment is indicated. However, the optimal management of patients presenting with ipsilateral positive mediastinal nodes (N2 disease) has not been determined yet. Different treatment regimens consisting of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery have been proposed and implemented previously. In more recent years, immunotherapy and targeted therapies have been added as therapeutic options. The introduction of these newer modalities has raised questions on the role of surgery after targeted therapy or immunotherapy. Recent studies have shown that surgical resection after induction immunotherapy or targeted therapy is indeed feasible, but is associated with a higher risk of conversion and increased morbidity due to hilar inflammation. In this review, we summarize the latest data on outcomes of patients undergoing surgical resection after induction immunotherapy and/or targeted therapy. Treatment outcomes have to be carefully evaluated to determine the contribution of surgery in multimodality treatment regimens including immunotherapy and targeted therapies.Multimodality therapy for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a complex and controversial issue, especially regarding optimal treatment regimens for patients with ipsilateral positive mediastinal nodes (N2 disease). Many trials investigating neoadjuvant immunotherapy and targeted therapy in this subpopulation have shown promising results, although concerns have risen regarding surgical feasibility. A thorough literature review was performed, analyzing all recent studies regarding surgical morbidity and mortality. Despite the fact that two major trials investigating this subject were terminated early, the overall consensus is that surgical management seems feasible. However, dissection of hilar vessels may be challenging due to hilar fibrosis. Further research is necessary to identify the role of surgery in these multimodality treatment regimens, and to define matters such as the optimal treatment regimen, the dosage of the different agents used, the interval between induction therapy and surgery, and the role of adjuvant therapy.

TI  - Current status and breakthroughs in treating advanced non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations
T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Recently, targeted therapy and immunotherapy have emerged as effective treatment options for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This progress has been facilitated by the rapid development of diagnostic and therapeutic technologies and the continuous research and development of new drugs, leading to a new era in precision medicine for NSCLC. This is a breakthrough for patients with common mutations in the human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene in NSCLC. Consequently, the use of targeted drugs has significantly improved survival. Nevertheless, certain rare genetic mutations are referred to as EGFR exon 20 insertion (ex20ins) mutations, which differ in structure from conventional EGFR gene mutations, namely, exon 19 deletion mutations (19-Del) and exon 21 point mutations. Owing to their distinct structural characteristics, patients harboring these EGFR ex20ins mutations are unresponsive to traditional tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy. This particular group of patients did not fall within the scope of their applicability. However, the activating A763_Y764insFQEA mutation elicits a more pronounced response than mutations in the near and far regions of the C-helix immediately following it and should, therefore, be treated differently. Currently, there is a lack of effective treatments for EGFR ex20ins mutations NSCLC. The efficacy of chemotherapy has been relatively favorable, whereas the effectiveness of immunotherapy remains ambiguous owing to inadequate clinical data. In addition, the efficacy of the first- and second-generation targeted drugs remains limited. However, third-generation and novel targeted drugs have proven to be effective. Although novel EGFR-TKIs are expected to treat EGFR ex20ins mutations in patients with NSCLC, they face many challenges. The main focus of this review is on emerging therapies that target NSCLC with EGFR ex20ins and highlight major ongoing clinical trials while also providing an overview of the associated challenges and research advancements in this area.

TI  - Pulmonary function and toxicities of proton versus photon for limited-stage small cell lung cancer
T2  - RADIATION ONCOLOGY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: We aimed to compare the oncological outcomes and toxicities of definitive proton beam therapy (PBT) and photon beam therapy in patients with limited-stage small cell lung cancer (LSSCLC). Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 262 patients with newly diagnosed LS-SCLC who underwent definitive PBT (n = 20; proton group) or photon beam therapy (n = 242; photon group) with concurrent chemotherapy between January 2016 and February 2021 and compared overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), dose-volume parameters, and toxicities between the groups. Results: The median follow-up duration was 24.5 months (range, 3.7 to 78.7). Baseline lung function was significantly worse and clinical target volume (CTV) was larger in the proton group (CTV: 296.6 vs. 215.3 mL; p = 0.080). The mean lung V10 was 37.7% +/- 16.8% and 51.6% +/- 24.5% in the proton and photon groups, respectively (p = 0.002). Two-year OS and PFS rates were 57.2% and 35.7% in the proton group and 65.3% and 40.8% in the photon group, respectively (p = 0.542 and 0.748, respectively). Grade =2 radiation pneumonitis and esophagitis occurred in 5 (25.0%) and 7 (35.0%) PBT-treated patients and 66 (27.3%) and 40 (16.5%) photon beam therapy-treated patients, respectively (p = 0.826 and 0.062, respectively). Conclusion: Although the proton group had poorer lung function and a larger CTV than that in the photon group, both groups exhibited comparable treatment outcomes and radiation-related toxicities in LS-SCLC. PBT may be a valuable therapeutic modality in patients with poor pulmonary function or extensive disease burden owing to its lung-sparing ability.

TI  - Survival and safety analysis of COVID-19 vaccine in Chinese patients with non-small cell lung cancer
T2  - CANCER MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 disease (COVID-19) has caused a worldwide challenging and threatening pandemic. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccines in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) patients. Methods: Patient self-reported adverse events related to vaccines were recorded by follow-up through a uniform questionnaire. Survival analysis was performed by Kaplan-Meier method. A multivariate analysis was performed by the Cox proportional hazard regression model to determine the effect of each variable on the survival of lung cancer patients. Results: A total of 860 patients with NSCLC on treatment were enrolled. Mean age was 57 years in patients with early stage group and 62 years in advanced stage group. The vaccination rate was 71.11% for early-stage patients and 19.48% for advanced-stage patients; most of them (86.5%) received the COVID-19 inactivated virus (Vero cell) vaccine (Coronavac; Sinovac). The most common systemic adverse reaction was weakness. The main reason for vaccine refusal in those unvaccinated patients was concern about the safety of vaccination in the presence of a tumor and undergoing treatment (56.9% and 53.4%). The 1-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate was 100% for vaccinated and 97.4% for unvaccinated early-stage patients. Then we compared the progression-free survival (PFS) of vaccinated (median PFS 9.0 months) and unvaccinated (median PFS 7.0 months) advanced stage patients (p = 0.815). Advanced NSCLC patients continued to be divided into groups receiving radio-chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and targeted therapy, with no statistical difference in PFS between the groups (p > 0.05). The median overall survival (OS) of vaccinated patients was 20.5 months, and that of unvaccinated patients was 19.0 months (p = 0.478) in advanced NSCLC patients. Conclusions: COVID-19 vaccination is safe for Chinese NSCLC patients actively receiving different antitumor treatments without increasing the incidence of adverse reactions, and vaccination does not affect cancer patient survival.

TI  - Controversies in Lung Cancer: Heterogeneity in Treatment Recommendations for Stage III NSCLC According to Disease Burden and Oncogenic Driver Alterations
T2  - CLINICAL LUNG CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - We performed a case-based survey of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) members to determine practice habits for stage III non???small-cell lung cancer patients. The presence of EGFR/ALK alterations were associated with fewer recommendations for chemoradiation. Despite the lack of reported clinical trial data, many IASLC lung cancer experts favored targeted therapy when actionable driver alterations were present. Introduction: Therapeutic options for stage III non???small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) consist of definitive chemoradiation, surgery combined with neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy, and trimodality therapy. More recently, biologically driven systemic therapy options, including immunotherapy and targeted therapy, have become increasingly available. Methods: A customized, case-based survey was designed and distributed to members of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) to determine practice habits and preferences for NSCLC patients with stage III disease and N2 to N3 nodal involvement. Results: Data were compiled from 87 respondents from 31 countries, including medical oncologists (49%), surgical oncologists (24%), and radiation oncologists (21%). Definitive chemoradiation was more likely to be recommended for stage IIIC (98.2%) or stage IIIB (75.8%) scenarios compared with stage IIIA (59.6%) without actionable driver alterations ( P < .0001 and .0003, respectively); and chemoradiation was more likely for stage IIIB (57.7%) compared to stage IIIA (39.9%) with actionable EGFR/ALK alterations ( P = .008). Surgery was more likely to be recommended in the presence of an actionable alteration (38.7% vs. 19%, P < .0001). Surgeons were more likely than medical oncologists to recommend surgical approaches in scenarios without actionable alterations (25.6% vs. 11.2%, P < .0001) or with actionable alterations (57.5% vs. 31.1%, P = .0001). Discussion: The dominant recommended strategy for stage III NSCLC was chemoradiation, although respondents were more likely to recommend surgical approaches in the presence of actionable alterations. Despite the lack of reported clinical trial data, many IASLC lung cancer experts favored targeted therapy when actionable driver alterations were present.

TI  - Overcoming Therapy Resistance in SCLC
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACTSmall cell lungcancer (SCLC) is a pulmonary neuroendocrine cancer with very poor prognosis and limitedeffective therapeutic options. Chemotherapy has been used for the past 30 years as for the treatment for SCLC.While most SCLCs initially respond to this treatment, nearly all relapse. Recently, immunotherapies have beenintroduced in SCLC treatment. While these treatments have revolutionized the treatment of non-small cell lungcancer (NSCLC), they are only effective in a very small subset of SCLCs. Thoracic radiation is recommended inthe course of both limited stage (LS) and extensive stage (ES) SCLC. Radiation has been shown to inducedurable responses by engaging anti-tumor immunity. However, radiation therapy while effective in someindividuals, does not always convert immunologically non-responsive “cold” tumors to become immuneresponsive “hot”. These observations highlight the need to develop new effective treatments for SCLC.In many cancers, the loss of cell cycle checkpoints, together with oncogene activation, leads to cell survival evenwith high levels of replication stress (RS) and DNA damage. Cellular pathways respond to RS, to ensure thatDNA is properly replicated and to prevent cells from prematurely entering mitosis. However, in most advancedsolid tumors, there is an increase in a variety of errors during DNA synthesis, disruption of the DNA damageresponse, and mitotic catastrophe. This continuous and high degree of RS and dependence on DNA repairprovides a potential cancer vulnerability and therapeutic opportunity. The vast majority of human tumorsincluding nearly all of SCLCs are dependent on telomerase holoenzyme to bypass replicative senescenceresulting from telomere shortening with each cell division and this creates a dependency. We are proposing toutilize a molecule that interferes with the function of telomerase to rapidly stop SCLC growth with minimal or nocytotoxic side effects in normal telomerase silent tissues. In our preliminary studies, we discovered that thismolecule not only can kill cancer cells in culture dish, it can also activate the immune system when givenintermittently to the mice. We propose to discover how this molecule sensitizes SCLCs to radiation orchemotherapy treatment (Aim 1), Induce immune responses (Aim 2), and to determine whether it can overcomeresistance to existing treatments (Aim 3). For this goal, we will utilize fully immunocompetent mouse models.Therapies that activate immune system have been less toxic compared to other treatments and often providemore durable responses in patients. We hope that our studies with this molecule will generate information todevelop rationally designed clinical trials which utilize combinations with minimal toxicity and maximumtherapeutic efficacy in small cell lung cancer

TI  - The Role of Surgery in Management of Locally Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
T2  - CURRENT TREATMENT OPTIONS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Opinion statementPatients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are treated for cure, but treatment decisions are not straightforward. Chemotherapy is essential due to the high risk of systemic relapse, but local therapy is also required for cure. In the small subset of stage III patients with N0 or N1 disease, surgery is typically the initial therapy and extended resections are frequent. The majority of IIIA patients present with N2 disease and treatment paradigms for these patients are controversial, particularly concerning the role of resection. Surgery has a limited role in bulky IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC disease, which is typically treated with combined systemic therapy and radiation. The authors believe that in resectable IIIA disease, the addition of surgery to multimodality treatment appears to improve local control and overall survival. Induction therapy is essential, and the use of chemotherapy alone or chemoradiotherapy remains an area of debate. Pneumonectomy should be used with caution in IIIA disease, as numerous prospective trials have noted excessive perioperative mortality. The introduction of immunotherapies in this stage may quickly transform treatment decisions.

TI  - Immunotherapy in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after progression on chemotherapy: real-world results from a prospective institutional cohort
T2  - IMMUNOTHERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To analyze the outcomes of patients receiving immunotherapy (IO) with advanced non-driver mutated non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after progression on systemic treatment. Methods: The overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and best response to IO of 64 patients who met our inclusion criteria were analyzed. Results: Median follow-up, OS and PFS were 35.9, 7.1 and 3.2 months, respectively. On uni- and multi-variable analysis, better ECOG PS and fewer extra-thoracic metastases were associated with prolonged OS and PFS. Response to IO was associated with prolonged OS, while thoracic radiotherapy and isolated CNS involvement were associated with prolonged PFS. ECOG PS, thoracic radiotherapy and PDL1 status significantly influenced the likelihood of response to IO. Overall, 30% patients experienced any grade toxicity. Conclusion: Our results are concordant with reported trial outcomes and support the application of IO in Indian patients.Plain language summary Several clinical trials have demonstrated favorable results with immunotherapy in patients with lung cancer who do not have a mutation in their tumors. However, clinical trials are often designed to provide the best chance for a trial drug/intervention to demonstrate effectiveness. Therefore, they usually include relatively healthier patients compared to what clinicians see in their practice. To demonstrate the efficacy of a drug outside a clinical trial, a real-world analysis is performed, which is reported in this article. We analyzed lung cancer patients treated with immunotherapy at our institution and found comparable efficacy to reported clinical trials. This was important because the trials did not include any patients from our country. We also found that patients with fewer sites of involvement outside the lung and those who received radiotherapy to the lung (either during or before receiving immunotherapy) survived longer without disease progression.

TI  - Safety evaluation of nivolumab added concurrently to radiotherapy in a standard first line chemo-radiotherapy regimen in stage III non-small cell lung cancer-The ETOP NICOLAS trial
T2  - LUNG CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Chemo-radiotherapy (CRT) and concurrent PD-1 inhibition has shown promising results in preclinical models. So far, the feasibility of delivering concurrent CRT and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition has never been assessed in a clinical trial.Material and methods: NICOLAS is a phase-II trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of nivolumab combined with CRT in stage III NSCLC. Patients received 3 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy and concurrent RT (66 Gy/33fractions). Nivolumab started concurrently with RT. The primary endpoint was 6-month post-RT rate of grade- >= 3-pneumonitis. A formal interim safety analysis (IA) was scheduled when the first 21 patients reached 3 months follow-up post-RT. An early positive safety conclusion would be reached at IA if there were no grade >= 3-pneumonitis in those patients. Efficacy evaluation was planned provided the safety conclusion was reached.Results and conclusion: As of 13 December 2018, 82 patients were recruited with median follow-up of 13.4 months. The most frequent adverse events (AEs) were anaemia, fatigue and pneumonitis. No unexpected AEs or increased toxicities were observed. For the first 21 patients, no grade- >= 3-pneumonitis was observed by the end of the 3-month post-RT follow-up period.The early safety IA provides evidence that the addition of nivolumab to concurrent CRT is safe and tolerable regarding the 6-month rate of pneumonitis grade >= 3 at the one-sided significance level of 5%. Following that, the 1-year progression-free survival will be evaluated in an expanded patient cohort NICOLAS trial creates the opportunity for assessing the activity of the combination of checkpoint with concurrent CRT in larger prospective trials for locally advanced NSCLC.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Recent trials have begun to explore immune checkpoint inhibitors for non-small cell lung cancer in the neoadjuvant setting, but data on tumour response and surgical outcome remain limited.METHODS: Retrospective evaluation of clinical data from patients with non-small cell lung cancer treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors followed by lung resection was performed at 2 large volume institutions (1 North American, 1 European). Data were analysed using Chi-squared, Fisher's and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests where appropriate.RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients were identified from 2017 to 2019. Forty-nine per cent were Stage IIIB and IV. Forty-six per cent received immunotherapy alone and 54% in combination with chemo- and/or radiotherapy. Sixteen per cent of cases were successfully performed minimally invasively. Twenty patients were operated with lobectomy (6 of these with wedges or segments of a neighbouring lobe, 2 with sleeve resections and 1 with a chest wall resection), 4 with bilobectomies, 11 with pneumonectomy (including 5 extrapleural pneumonectomies and 1 atrial resection) and 1 with a wedge resection. Overall, 10 patients (27%) developed postoperative complications and the 90day mortality was zero. One-year recurrence-free survival was 73% for stage II/IIIA and 55% for stage IIIB/stage IV. The major pathologic response rate was 34%.CONCLUSION: In this retrospective study, lung resection after immunotherapy (alone or in combination) is safe, although often requires complex surgery. Due to increasing number of clinical trials adopting immunotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting, it is likely that this therapy will become part of standard of care. Immunotherapy may also allow surgery to have a role for selected patients with advanced disease.

TI  - Case report: Sintilimab combined with anlotinib as neoadjuvant chemotherapy for metastatic bone tumor resection in patients with PSC
T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinoma (PSC) is a rare subtype of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which is resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy with a poor prognosis. PSC is highly malignant and is prone to recurrence even after surgery. The programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) tumor cell proportion score (TPS) 5%, TERT and TP53 gene mutations were detected in this patient accompanied by multiple metastatic sites. The anlotinib is a novel multitarget tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that could be effective for advanced NSCLC and some sarcoma patients. Limited clinical trials and case reports have shown that PSC patients with gene mutations and PD-L1 expression have good responses to multitarget antiangiogenic drug and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). In this article, we reported a case with metastatic PSC diagnosed by Computed Tomography (CT)-guided needle biopsy treated with immunotherapy combined with antiangiogenic drugs as a neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). PSC is controlled and the patient achieves successfully limb salvage treatment by surgical resection. Therefore, targeted therapy and immunotherapy can provide sufficient surgical opportunities for limb salvage in the treatment of metastatic PSC patients.Case summary A 69-year-old male diagnosed with malignant bone tumor in the proximal femur was admitted to our hospital in June 2022 with recurrent fever as well as swelling and pain in the left thigh for twenty days. The initial computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest showed a pulmonary cavity (20 mm x 30 mm) and scattered lung masses. Subsequently, he underwent a CT-guided needle biopsy to distinguish the essence of osteolytic bone destruction and soft tissue mass in the left proximal femur which showed metastatic sarcomatoid carcinoma histology. Genetic testing revealed TERT c.-124C mutation (abundance 8.81%), TP53 p.R342 mutation (abundance 11.35%), tumor mutational burden (TMB) 7.09 muts/Mb, microsatellite stability (MSS), and PD-L1 (SP263) TPS 5% were also detected. The patient was tentatively treated with a combination of antiangiogenic drug and PD-1 inhibitor. After one course, the tumor volume significantly reduced in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and pathological fracture occurred in the femur after combined treatment. The patient received proximal femoral tumor resection and prosthesis replacement after defervescence. Sequentially sintilimab with anlotinib were administered for over 1 year. Finally, the local tumor was well controlled, and no obvious drug-related adverse reactions were observed. The lesions in the lung remained in partial response (PR) for more than 16 months and complete response (CR) of metastatic tumor in the proximal femur was observed through imaging examinations.Conclusion This is the first reported case of a metastatic PSC in femur showing a favorable response to the treatment consisting of anlotinib combined with sintilimab. This case suggests that antiangiogenic therapy combined with immunotherapy may benefit patients with metastatic PSC in the preoperative adjuvant therapy for limb salvage.

TI  - Efficacy and toxicity analysis of thoracic radiotherapy for extensive-stage small cell lung cancer patients after first-line chemoimmunotherapy
T2  - Chinese Journal of Radiation Oncology
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To evaluate the safety and efficacy of thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) for extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) patients in the era of first-line chemoimmunotherapy. Methods Medical records of 56 patients with ES-SCLC who received thoracic radiotherapy after first-line platinum-based chemotherapy plus immunotherapy in Cancer Hospital Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences from January 2018 to December 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. The control group was not established for clinical causes. The overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and local recurrence-free survival (LRFS) were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate analyses were employed to identify prognostic factors using the Cox proportional hazards model. The cumulative incidence of local regional recurrence (LRR) was estimated using the Fine-Grey competing risks regression model. Results Among 56 patients in our cohort, 47 patients received consolidative TRT (cTRT) before progression and 9 patients received salvage TRT after progression. The median follow-up time was 21 months (95%CI=19.8-22.2 months), the median OS was not reached, the median PFS was 9 months (95%CI=7.0-13.0 months), and the 1-year and 18-month OS rates were 84.9%, 62.1%. In the cTRT group, the 1-year and 18-month OS rates were 84.1%, 64.5%, with the median PFS of 10 months; 1-year and 18-month LRFS rates were 73.6% and 66.0%, respectively; the cumulative incidence of LRR at 1-year and 2-year were 24.9% and 30.8%, respectively. No other 4-5 grade adverse events (AE) were reported except 6 patients presenting with 4 grade hematologic toxicities. Three grade radiation esophagitis occurred in 3 patients (5%). Ten patients (18%) developed 1-2 grade treatment-related pneumonitis, including 5 (9%) patients with immune related pneumonitis and 5 (9%) patients with radiation pneumonitis. Conclusion The application of TRT after first-line chemoimmunotherapy is safe and may has potential survival benefit for patients with ES-SCLC.

TI  - Safety of Anlotinib Capsules Combined with PD-1 Inhibitor Camrelizumab in the Third-Line Treatment of Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer and Their Effect on Serum Tumor Markers
T2  - JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. To explore the safety of anlotinib capsules combined with the PD-1 inhibitor (camrelizumab) in the third-line treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and their effect on serum tumor markers. Methods. 88 patients with advanced NSCLC treated in the Oncology Department of our hospital from December 2018 to December 2019 were selected as research subjects and randomly and equally split into the single treatment group (STG) and combined treatment group (CTG). The levels of serum tumor markers after treatment were detected in both groups, and the incidence of adverse reactions during treatment was recorded. Results. Compared with the STG, CTG achieved obviously higher total effective rate (P < 0.05), lower total incidence of adverse reactions (P < 0.05), lower levels of serum tumor markers and average CFS score (P < 0.001), and higher average KPS score (P < 0.001). Conclusion. Application of anlotinib capsules combined with the PD-1 inhibitor (camrelizumab) in the third-line treatment of advanced NSCLC can effectively reduce the levels of serum tumor markers and cancer fatigue degree of patients, with a better effect than that of simple anlotinib treatment. In addition, further research of the combined treatment is helpful to establish a better therapeutic regimen for patients with advanced NSCLC.

TI  - ASTRO Radiation Therapy Summary of the ASCO Guideline on Management of Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
T2  - PRACTICAL RADIATION ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: To develop a radiation therapy summary of recommendations on the management of locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) based on the Management of Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: American Society of Clinical Oncology Guideline, which was endorsed by the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO).Methods: The American Society of Clinical Oncology, ASTRO, and the American College of Chest Physicians convened a multidisci-plinary panel to develop a guideline based on a systematic review of the literature and a formal consensus process, that has been sepa-rately published. A new panel consisting of radiation oncologists from the original guideline as well as additional ASTRO members was formed to provide further guidance to the radiation oncology community. A total of 127 articles met the eligibility criteria to answer 5 clinical questions. This summary focuses on the 3 radiation therapy questions (neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and unresectable settings). Results: Radiation-specific recommendations are summarized with additional relevant commentary on specific questions regarding the management of preoperative radiation, postoperative radiation, and combined chemoradiation.Conclusions: Patients with stage III NSCLC who are planned for surgical resection, should receive either neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiation. The addition of neoadjuvant treatment is particularly important in patients planned for surgery in the N2 or superior sulcus settings. Postoperatively, patients who did not receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be offered adjuvant chemotherapy. The use of postoperative radiation for completely resected N2 disease is not routinely recommended. Unresectable patients with stage III NSCLC should ideally be managed with combined concurrent chemoradiation using a platinum-based doublet with a standard radia-tion dose of 60 Gy followed by consolidation durvalumab in patients without progression after initial therapy. Patients who cannot tol-erate a concurrent chemoradiation approach can be managed either by sequential chemotherapy followed by radiation or by dose -escalated or hypofractionated radiation alone.

TI  - Safety and efficacy of nivolumab and standard chemotherapy drug combination in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer: a four arms phase Ib study
T2  - ANNALS OF ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The human IgG4 monoclonal antibody nivolumab targets programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and promotes antitumor response by blocking the interaction of PD-1 with its ligands. This single-center phase Ib study investigated the tolerability, safety, and pharmacokinetics of nivolumab combined with standard chemotherapy in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Patients and methods: Patients who had stage IIIB without indication for definitive radiotherapy, stage IV, or recurrent NSCLC were eligible. Regimens were nivolumab 10 mg/kg + gemcitabine/cisplatin (arm A), pemetrexed/cisplatin (arm B), paclitaxel/carboplatin/bevacizumab (arm C), or docetaxel (arm D). Regimens A, B, and D were repeated every 3 weeks for up to four cycles and regimen C was repeated for up to six cycles; nivolumab alone (arm A), with pemetrexed (arm B), bevacizumab (arm C), or docetaxel (arm D) was continued every 3 weeks as maintenance therapy until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was evaluated during the first treatment cycle.Results: As of March 2014, six patients were enrolled in each arm. The combination of nivolumab 10 mg/kg and chemotherapy was well tolerated. DLT was observed in only one patient in arm A (alanine aminotransferase increased). Select adverse events (those with a potential immunologic cause) of any grade were observed in six, four, six, and five patients in arms A, B, C, and D, respectively. Three, three, six, and one patient achieved partial response while median progression-free survival was 6.28, 9.63 months, not reached, and 3.15 months in arms A, B, C, and D, respectively.Conclusions: Combination of nivolumab 10 mg/kg and chemotherapy showed an acceptable toxicity profile and encouraging antitumor activity in patients with advanced NSCLC.

AB  - The medical TGMB has a robust clinical program for treatment of patients with advanced thoracic and GI cancers who have failed standard therapies. The thoracic team is conducting innovative studies for patients with non-small cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer, malignant mesothelioma and thymic cancers. These include use of novel treatments developed by scientists at the NCI. A major focus of our team is the development of drugs targeting the tumor antigen, mesothelin that is highly expressed in many cancers. We are using an immunotoxin -LMB-100 and an antibody drug conjugate- BAY 94-9343 to treat these cancers. In addition, we are conducting clinical trials using immunotherapy agents including immune checkpoint inhibitors to treat patients with thoracic cancers who have failed standard treatments. The TGIB is also conducting studies for treatment of gastrointestinal cancers with a special emphasis on liver and pancreatic cancer. Investigators within the TGMB have established a robust program for treatment of patients with liver cancer including use of immunotherapy agents either alone or in combination with radiation therapy or locally ablative therapies for liver cancer. The gastrointestinal group is also conducting clinical trials of novel agents for treatment of pancreatic cancer.

TI  - Correlations between pathogenic variants in DNA repair genes and anticancer treatment efficacy in stage IV non-small cell lung cancer: A large real-world cohort and review of the literature
T2  - THORACIC CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Mutations in genes involved in DNA damage repair (DDR), a hallmark of cancer, are associated with increased cancer cell sensitivity to certain therapies. This study sought to evaluate the association of DDR pathogenic variants with treatment efficacy in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Methods: A retrospective cohort of consecutive patients with advanced NSCLC attending a tertiary medical center who underwent next-generation sequencing in 01/2015-8/2020 were clustered according to DDR gene status and compared for overall response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS) (patients receiving systemic therapy), local PFS (patients receiving definitive radiotherapy), and overall survival (OS) using log-rank and Cox regression analyses.Results: Of 225 patients with a clear tumor status, 42 had a pathogenic/likely pathogenic DDR variant (pDDR), and 183 had no DDR variant (wtDDR). Overall survival was similar in the two groups (24.2 vs. 23.1 months, p = 0.63). The pDDR group had a higher median local PFS after radiotherapy (median 45 months vs. 9.9 months, respectively; p = 0.044), a higher ORR (88.9% vs. 36.2%, p = 0.04), and a longer median PFS (not reached vs. 6.0 months, p = 0.01) in patients treated with immune checkpoint blockade. There was no difference in ORR, median PFS, and median OS in patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy.Conclusion: Our retrospective data suggest that in patients with stage 4 NSCLC, pathogenic variants in DDR pathway genes may be associated with higher efficacy of radiotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). This should be further explored prospectively.

TI  - Immunoradiotherapy as an Effective Therapeutic Strategy in Lung Cancer: From Palliative Care to Curative Intent
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Lung cancer is one of the main causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Over the years, different therapeutic modalities have been adopted depending on tumor stage and patient characteristics, such as surgery, radiotherapy (RT), and chemotherapy. Recently, with the development of immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), the treatment of metastatic and locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has experienced a revolution that has resulted in a significant improvement in overall survival with an enhanced toxicity profile. Despite this paradigm shift, most patients present some kind of resistance to ICI. In this setting, current research is shifting towards the integration of multiple therapies, with RT and ICI being one of the most promising based on the potential immunostimulatory synergy of this combination. This review gives an overview of the evolution and current state of the combination of RT and ICI and provides evidence-based data that can improve patient selection. The combination in lung cancer is a safe therapeutic approach that improves local control and progression-free survival, and it has the potential to unleash abscopal responses. Additionally, this treatment strategy seems to be able to re-sensitize select patients that have reached a state of resistance to ICI, further enabling the continuation of systemic therapy.

TI  - Metrics of dose to highly ventilated lung are predictive of radiation-induced pneumonitis in lung cancer patients
T2  - RADIOTHERAPY AND ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: To identify metrics of radiation dose delivered to highly ventilated lung that are predictive of radiation-induced pneumonitis. Methods and Materials: A cohort of 90 patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer treated with standard fractionated radiation therapy (RT) (60-66 Gy in 30-33 fractions) were evaluated. Regional lung ventilation was determined from pre-RT 4-dimensional computed tomography (4DCT) using the Jacobian determinant of a B-spline deformable image registration to estimate lung tissue expansion during respiration. Multiple voxel-wise population- and individual-based thresholds for defining high functioning lung were considered. Mean dose and volumes receiving dose >= 5-60 Gy were analyzed for both total lung-ITV (MLD,V5-V60) and highly ventilated functional lung-ITV (fMLD,fV5-fV60). The primary endpoint was symptomatic grade 2+ (G2+) pneumonitis. Receiver operator curve (ROC) analyses were used to identify predictors of pneumonitis. Results: G2+ pneumonitis occurred in 22.2% of patients, with no differences between stage, smoking status, COPD, or chemo/immunotherapy use between G<2 and G2+ patients (P >= 0.18). Highly ventilated lung was defined as voxels exceeding the population-wide median of 18% voxel-level expansion. All total and functional metrics were significantly different between patients with and without pneumonitis (P <= 0.039). Optimal ROC points predicting pneumonitis from functional lung dose were fMLD <= 12.3 Gy, fV5 <= 54% and fV20 <= 19 %. Patients with fMLD <= 12.3 Gy had a 14% risk of developing G2+ pneumonitis whereas risk significantly increased to 35% for those with fMLD > 12.3 Gy (P = 0.035). Conclusions: Dose to highly ventilated lung is associated with symptomatic pneumonitis and treatment planning strategies should focus on limiting dose to functional regions. These findings provide important metrics to be used in functional lung avoidance RT planning and designing clinical trials. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Role of surgery in a novel multimodal therapeutic approach to complete cure of advanced lung cancer: current and future perspectives
T2  - SURGERY TODAY
M3  - Review
AB  - Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is considered potentially curable by multimodal therapy in a subset of patients, including those with locally advanced (LA) disease or nodal spread, who would otherwise have a poor prognosis. Guidelines recommend perioperative chemotherapy with platinum-based regimens, with or without radiotherapy, as the standard treatment modality for high-risk resectable LA-NSCLC. Although the classical regimens of adjuvant chemotherapy have been platinum-based doublet or oral agents such as tegafur/uracil, some molecular targeted therapeutic agents and immune checkpoint inhibitors have been developed recently with an expected favorable effect. Recent trials of perioperative therapy using these agents have demonstrated favourable anticancer efficacy for LA-NSCLC with an acceptable adverse events profile. The ideal timing of perioperative therapy administration, before or after surgery, is still controversial. Because some speculation and concepts have arisen from basic research, several trials are ongoing to clarify the efficacy of newly developed agents in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting. This review discusses the role of surgery in the new era and analyzes when and which optimal perioperative multimodal therapy, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, molecular-targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, should be administered for resectable or potentially resectable NSCLC to provide possible complete cure.

TI  - Gefitinib induction followed by chemoradiotherapy in EGFR-mutant, locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer: LOGIK0902/OLCSG0905 phase II study
T2  - ESMO OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The role of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) induction coupled with standard concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is unclear in unresectable, stage III, EGFR-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Therefore, a phase II trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of gefitinib induction followed by CRT in this disease setting.Patients and methods: Patients with unresectable, EGFR-mutant, stage III NSCLC were administered gefitinib monotherapy (250 mg/day) for 8 weeks. Subsequently, patients without disease progression during induction therapy were administered cisplatin and docetaxel (40 mg/m(2) each) on days 1, 8, 29, and 36 with concurrent radiotherapy at a total dose of 60 Gy. The primary endpoint was the 2-year overall survival (OS) rate, which was hypothesized to reach 85%, with a threshold of the lower limit of 60%.Results: Twenty patients (median age: 66 years; male/female: 9/11; histology: 20 adenocarcinoma; stage IIIA/IIIB: 9/11; and exon 19/21: 10/10) were enrolled. The 2-year OS rate was 90% (90% confidence interval: 71.4% to 96.8%), indicating that this trial met the primary objective. The overall response rate and 1- and 2-year progression-free survival rates were 85.0%, 58.1%, and 36.9%, respectively. Grade >= 3 adverse events (>10%) included hepatic toxicity during the induction phase and neutropenia and febrile neutropenia in the CRT phase. Radiation pneumonitis grade >= 3 or treatment-related death did not occur.Conclusions: This is the first prospective study to demonstrate the favorable efficacy and safety of EGFR-TKI induction followed by standard CRT in EGFR-mutant, stage III NSCLC. Further confirmatory studies are needed.

TI  - Sex-Based Clinical Outcome in Advanced NSCLC Patients Undergoing PD-1/PD-L1 Inhibitor Therapy-A Retrospective Bi-Centric Cohort Study
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Retrospective analyses suggest that men treated with immune-checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) monotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have better outcomes than women. However, female patients have more favorable responses when chemotherapy (CHT) is given together with ICI. We aimed to explore the clinical impact of such sex differences in two cohorts, receiving ICI monotherapy or ICI-CHT combination, respectively. We found no significant difference in outcomes between men and women treated with either therapeutic regimen. However, known predictive factors for ICI response such as the expression of programmed-death ligand 1 (PD-L1) on tumor cells or patient performance status had significant implications for men rather than for women. Our results warrant increased research efforts to clarify sex-specific differences in anti-tumor immune response mechanisms and in the efficacy of ICI therapies, especially in women. Men with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have a more favorable response to immune-checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) monotherapy, while women especially benefit from ICI-chemotherapy (CHT) combinations. To elucidate such sex differences in clinical practice, we retrospectively analyzed two cohorts treated with either ICI monotherapy (n = 228) or ICI-CHT combination treatment (n = 80) for advanced NSCLC. Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to calculate progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS), influencing variables were evaluated using Cox-regression analyses. No significant sex differences for PFS/OS could be detected in either cohort. Men receiving ICI monotherapy had a statistically significant independent impact on PFS by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG) >= 2 (hazard ratio (HR) 1.90, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.10-3.29, p = 0.021), higher C-reactive protein (CRP; HR 1.06, 95%CI: 1.00-1.11, p = 0.037) and negative programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) status (HR 2.04, 95%CI: 1.32-3.15, p = 0.001), and on OS by CRP (HR 1.09, 95%CI: 1.03-1.14, p = 0.002). In men on ICI-CHT combinations, multivariate analyses (MVA) revealed squamous histology (HR 4.00, 95%CI: 1.41-11.2, p = 0.009) significant for PFS; and ECOG >= 2 (HR 5.58, 95%CI: 1.88-16.5, p = 0.002) and CRP (HR 1.19, 95%CI: 1.06-1.32, p = 0.002) for OS. Among women undergoing ICI monotherapy, no variable proved significant for PFS, while ECOG >= 2 had a significant interaction with OS (HR 1.90, 95%CI 1.04-3.46, p = 0.037). Women treated with ICI-CHT had significant MVA findings for CRP with both PFS (HR 1.09, 95%CI: 1.02-1.16, p = 0.007) and OS (HR 1.11, 95%CI: 1.03-1.19, p = 0.004). Although men and women responded similarly to both ICI mono- and ICI-CHT treatment, predictors of response differed by sex.

TI  - Mutant-allele dispersion correlates with prognosis risk in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF CANCER RESEARCH AND CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundIntra-tumor heterogeneity (ITH) contributes to lung cancer progression and resistance to therapy. To evaluate ITH and determine whether it may be employed as a predictive biomarker of prognosis in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), we used a novel algorithm called mutant-allele dispersion (MAD).MethodsIn the study, 103 patients with advanced NSCLC were enrolled. Using a panel of 425 cancer-related genes, next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed on tumor specimens that had been collected. From NGS data, we derived MAD values, and we next looked into their relationships with clinical variables and different mutation subtypes.ResultsThe median MAD among 103 NSCLC patients was 0.73. EGFR mutation, tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy cycles were all substantially correlated with the MAD score. In patients with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), correlation analysis revealed that the MAD score was substantially linked with Notch pathway mutation (P = 0.021). A significant relationship between high MAD and shorter progression-free survival (PFS) was found (HR = 2.004, 95%CI 1.269-3.163, P = 0.003). In patients with advanced NSCLC, histological type (P = 0.004), SMARCA4 mutation (P = 0.038), and LRP1B mutation (P = 0.006) were all independently associated with prognosis. The disease control rate was considerably greater in the low MAD group compared to the high MAD group in 19 LUAD patients receiving immunotherapy (92.9% vs. 40%, P = 0.037). TKI-PFS was longer in 37 patients with low MAD who received first-line TKI therapy (P = 0.014).ConclusionOur findings suggested that MAD is a practical and simple algorithm for assessing ITH, and populations with high MAD values are more likely to have EGFR mutations. MAD can be used as a potential biomarker to predict not only the prognosis of NSCLC but also the efficacy of immunotherapy and TKI therapy in patients with advanced NSCLC.

TI  - Final efficacy outcomes of atezolizumab with chemoradiation for unresectable NSCLC: The phase II DETERRED trial
T2  - LUNG CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The phase II DETERRED trial assessed the safety and efficacy of consolidation and concurrent immunotherapy with chemoradiation in unresectable locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer. We present updated efficacy analysis of this trial.Methods: The trial was conducted in 2 parts with patients in part 1 (n = 10) receiving chemoradiation with consolidation atezolizumab, while patients in part 2 (n = 30) received concurrent and consolidation atezolizumab. Progression-free survival (PFS), time to second progression (PFS2), and overall survival (OS) were assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Subset analyses were performed by programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) status and targetable driver oncogene mutation status.Results: At a median follow-up of 39.2 months, the median PFS for part 1 was 18.9 months and 15.1 months for part 2. Median OS for part 1 was 26.5 months and was not reached for part 2. For the cohort, 3-year OS was 53.8%, while 4-year OS was 47.4%. Patients with targetable driver oncogene mutations had a median PFS of 9.4 months and OS of not reached compared to 16.6 months (HR: 3.49, p = 0.02) and 26.9 months (HR: 0.40, p = 0.12) respectively compared to those without targetable driver oncogene mutations. Patients with PD-L1 < 1% had median PFS of 11.0 months and OS of 26.5 months compared to 27.4 months (HR: 2.01, p = 0.10) and not reached (HR: 1.49, p = 0.41) respectively for those with PD-L1 = 1%.Conclusions: In the DETERRED trial, chemoradiation with concurrent and/or consolidative atezolizumab led to comparable efficacy as consolidative durvalumab in the PACIFIC trial. The presence of targetable driver oncogene mutations led to worse PFS, while PD-L1 < 1% trended to worse PFS.

TI  - Real-World Efficacy and Safety of Thoracic Radiotherapy after First-Line Chemo-Immunotherapy in Extensive-Stage Small-Cell Lung Cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - (1) Background: At present, the efficacy and safety of thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) after chemo-immunotherapy (CT-IT) in patients with extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) still remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of TRT after CT-IT in patients with ES-SCLC. (2) Methods: From January 2020 to October 2021, patients with ES-SCLC treated with first-line anti-PD-L1 antibody plus platinum-etoposide chemotherapy were enrolled retrospectively. The survival data and adverse events data of patients treated with or without TRT after CT-IT were collected for analysis. (3) Results: A total of 118 patients with ES-SCLC treated with first-line CT-IT were retrospectively enrolled, with 45 patients with TRT and 73 patients without TRT after CT-IT. The median PFS and OS in the CT-IT + TRT group and CT-IT only group were 8.0 months versus 5.9 months (HR = 0.64, p = 0.025) and 22.7 months versus 14.7 months (HR = 0.52, p = 0.015), respectively. The median PFS and OS in all 118 patients treated with first-line CT-IT were 7.2 and 19.8 months with an ORR of 72.0%. In multivariate analyses, liver metastasis and response to CT-IT were shown to be independent prognostic factors of PFS (p < 0.05), while liver metastasis and bone metastasis were independent predictive factors of OS (p < 0.05). Although TRT was significantly associated with better PFS and OS in univariate analysis, the association of TRT and OS failed to reach statistical significance (HR = 0.564, p = 0.052) in multivariate analysis. There was no significant difference in adverse events (AEs) between two treatment groups (p = 0.58). (4) Conclusions: ES-SCLC patients treated with TRT after first-line CT-IT had prolonged PFS and OS with an acceptable safety profile. Further prospective randomized studies are necessary to explore the efficacy and safety of this treatment modality for ES-SCLC in future.

TI  - Transitioning to Neoadjuvant Therapy for Resectable Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: Trends and Surgical Outcomes in a Regionalized Network
T2  - CLINICAL LUNG CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Of all 428 resectable stage II and III NSCLC patients included in this study, 25% received neoadjuvant therapy. Perioperative outcomes and 5-year overall survival were similar between patients having received neoadjuvant therapy versus upfront surgery. Establishing a neoadjuvant therapy program for NSCLC is feasible and safe from a surgical perspective. Background: Several regulatory agencies have approved the use of the neoadjuvant chemo-immunotherapy for resectable stage II and III of non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and numerous trials investigating novel agents are underway. However, significant concerns exist around the feasibility and safety of offering curative surgery to patients treated within such pathways. The goal in this study was to evaluate the impact of a transition towards a large-scale neoadjuvant therapy program for NSCLC. Methods: Medical charts of patients with clinical stage II and III NSCLC who underwent resection from January 2015 to December 2020 were reviewed. The primary outcome was perioperative complication rate between neoadjuvant-treated versus upfront surgery patients. Multivariable logistic regression estimated occurrence of postoperative complications and overall survival was assessed as an explorator y secondar y outcome by Kaplan-Meier and Cox -regression analyses. Results: Of the 428 patients included, 106 (24.8%) received neoadjuvant therapy and 322 (75.2%) upfront surgery. Frequency of minor and major postoperative complications was similar between groups ( P = .22). Occurrence in postoperative complication was similar in both cohort (aOR = 1.31, 95% CI 0.73-2.34). Neoadjuvant therapy administration increased from 10% to 45% with a rise in targeted and immuno therapies over time, accompanied by a reduced rate of preoperative radiation therapy use. 1-, 2-, and 5 -year overall survival was higher in neoadjuvant therapy compared to upfront surgery patients (Log -Rank P = .017). Conclusions: No significant differences in perioperative outcomes and survival were observed in resectable NSCLC patients treated by neoadjuvant therapy versus upfront surgery. Transition to neoadjuvant therapy among resectable NSCLC patients is safe and feasible from a surgical perspective.

TI  - Deep diving in the PACIFIC: Practical issues in stage III non-small cell lung cancer to avoid shipwreck
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - After publication of the PACIFIC trial results, immune checkpoint inhibitor-based immunotherapy was included in the treatment algorithm of locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The PACIFIC trial demonstrated that 12 mo of durvalumab consolidation therapy after radical-intent platinum doublet chemotherapy with concomitant radiotherapy improved both progression-free survival and overall survival in patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC. This is the first treatment in decades to successfully improve survival in this clinical setting, with manageable toxicity and without deterioration in quality of life. The integration of durvalumab in the management of locally advanced NSCLC accentuates the need for multidisciplinary, coordinated decision-making among lung cancer specialists, bringing new challenges and controversies as well as important changes in clinical work routines. The aim of the present article is to review-from a practical, multidisciplinary perspective - the findings and implications of the PACIFIC trial. We evaluate the immunobiological basis of durvalumab as well as practical aspects related to programmed cell death ligand 1 determination. In addition, we comprehensively assess the efficacy and toxicity data from the PACIFIC trial and discuss the controversies and practical aspects of incorporating durvalumab into routine clinical practice. Finally, we discuss unresolved questions and future challenges. In short, the present document aims to provide clinicians with a practical guide for the application of the PACIFIC regimen in routine clinical practice.

TI  - Predictive value of post-treatment C-reactive protein-to-albumin ratio in locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients receiving durvalumab after chemoradiotherapy
T2  - THORACIC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Backgrounds The PACIFIC trial established durvalumab consolidation therapy after concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) as the standard treatment for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC). However, little is known about the predictive factors of durvalumab efficacy in this population. This study aimed to validate the predictive use of inflammation-related parameters in patients with LA-NSCLC treated with CCRT plus durvalumab. Methods We recruited 76 LA-NSCLC patients who received CCRT followed by durvalumab from 10 Japanese institutions. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), C-reactive protein-to-albumin ratio (CAR), and prognostic nutrition index (PNI) were measured before (pre-treatment) and 2 months after (post-treatment) durvalumab induction. Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to examine prognostic factors associated with progression-free survival (PFS) after durvalumab therapy. Results The median follow-up time was 17 (range, 3.3-35.8) months. The median PFS and overall survival (OS) times were 26.1 and 33.7 months, respectively. Durvalumab was discontinued in 47 (61.8%) patients, with non-infectious pneumonitis being the most common reason. Post-treatment CAR (cutoff, 0.2) was a significant stratifying factor in survival comparison (<0.2 vs. >= 0.2, median PFS, not-reached vs. 9.6 months. Log-rank, p = 0.002). Multivariate analysis with a Cox proportional hazards model showed that post-treatment CAR was an independent prognostic factor for PFS (hazard ratio, 3.16, p = 0.003). Conclusions This study suggests that post-treatment CAR has predictive value for LA-NSCLC patients treated with CCRT plus durvalumab consolidation therapy.

AB  - Lung cancer is one of the cancers with the highest incidence in the world, and there is no standard treatment plan after second-line progression. Tumor angiogenesis has now been identified as an important therapeutic target for malignant tumors. Small molecule multi-target vascular kinase inhibitors can inhibit tumor angiogenesis by inhibiting angiogenesis-related signal pathways. At present, a lot of clinical trials of small molecule anti-angiogenic drugs for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have been carried out, and some vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (VEGFR-TKIs) have been approved for the treatment of advanced NSCLC. Based on the development status of multiple small molecule anti-angiogenic drugs at home and abroad for the treatment of NSCLC, this article summarizes the efficacy and safety studies of multiple VEGFR-TKIs and fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)-TKI single agents or combination treatments [including combined with chemotherapy, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-TKIs, immunotherapy, and radiotherapy, etc.] for NSCLC, and at the same time discussed the possible existence of VEGFR-TKIs drug resistance mechanisms and efficacy predictors, etc., and prospect the future development trend and potential problems of anti-vascular treatment of NSCLC, and provide new ideas for the follow-up precision and individualized treatment of lung cancer. .

T2  - EXPERT OPINION ON BIOLOGICAL THERAPY
M3  - Review
AB  - Standard of care for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (surgery, chemotherapy and radiation) may enhance patient survival but the enhancement is typically transient and quite uncommon with advanced disease. Researchers and medical professionals are using new approaches to improve patient mortality and morbidity. One of these approaches, immunotherapy, seeks to stimulate antitumour immunity above a threshold level needed for tumour regression or to induce stability in the face of progression. Among the most established approaches are vaccines involving monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) or immune effector cells. These approaches stimulate the humoral and cell-mediated arms of the immune system, respectively. As the development of humanised or fully human antibodies has spurred exploration of radioimmunoconjugates and immunotoxins, mAbs have enjoyed a revival of sorts. Cell-based therapies using the tumour cell itself as a vaccine component has resulted in disease stabilisation or regression. In addition, immune cells (e.g., T-lymphocytes and dendritic cells [DCs]) are the focal point of numerous patient trials in which meaningful clinical impact was achieved. In general, there are many tactics under development for the treatment of NSCLC. This review primarily concerns immunotherapeutic cancer treatments that are either already in clinical trial or well progressed into preclinical studies.

TI  - HER2-Altered Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Journey from Current Approaches to Emerging Strategies
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Simple Summary The introduction of trastuzumab deruxtecan is significantly changing the therapeutic landscape of advanced HER2-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The results of the DESTINY-Lung04 trial are highly anticipated for their potential to redefine the first-line therapeutic standard for HER2-mutant disease. Furthermore, several studies evaluating combination therapy regimes are currently ongoing. This review outlines the current state of the art in the clinical management of HER2-altered NSCLC and explores potential future perspectives in the field of HER2 targeted strategies.Abstract For patients diagnosed with advanced HER2-altered non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the current standard of care is represented by a platinum-pemetrexed-based chemotherapy, eventually in combination with immunotherapy. Different pan-HER tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been evaluated in limited phase II trials, yielding generally unsatisfactory outcomes, although certain genotypes demonstrated some clinical benefit. Conversely, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) targeting HER2, particularly trastuzumab-deruxtecan, have shown promising results against HER2-mutant disease, including a great intracranial activity in patients with brain metastasis. Based on the results obtained from DESTINY-Lung01 and DESTINY-Lung02 trials, trastuzumab deruxtecan received regulatory approval as the first targeted therapy for pre-treated, HER2-mutant, advanced NSCLC patients. More recently, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted the accelerated approval of trastuzumab deruxtecan for advanced, pre-treated HER2-positive solid tumours with no other treatment options. In this scenario, emerging evidence is increasingly pointing towards the exploration of combination regimens with synergistic effects in the advanced disease. In this review, we provide a detailed summary of current approaches and emerging strategies in the management of HER2-altered NSCLC, also focusing on unmet needs, including the treatment of patients with brain metastases.

TI  - SCLC Treatment in the Immuno-Oncology Era: Current Evidence and Unmet Needs
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) represents about 13%-15% of all lung cancers. It has a particularly unfavorable prognosis and in about 70% of cases occurs in the advanced stage (extended disease). Three phase III studies tested the combination of immunotherapy (atezolizumab, durvalumab with or without tremelimumab, and pembrolizumab) with double platinum chemotherapy, with practice-changing results. However, despite the high tumor mutational load and the chronic pro-inflammatory state induced by prolonged exposure to cigarette smoke, the benefit observed with immunotherapy is very modest and most patients experience disease recurrence. Unfortunately, biological, clinical, or molecular factors that can predict this risk have not yet been identified. Thanks to these clinically meaningful steps forward, SCLC is no longer considered an "orphan" disease. Innovative treatment strategies and combinations are currently under investigation to further improve the expected prognosis of patients with SCLC. Following the recent therapeutic innovations, we have reviewed the available literature data about SCLC management, with a focus on current unmet needs and potential predictive factors. In detail, the role of radiotherapy; fragile populations, such as elderly or low-performance status patients (ECOG PS 2), usually excluded from randomized studies; predictive factors of response useful to optimize and guide therapeutic choices; and new molecular targets and future combinations have been explored and revised.

TI  - MiRNA-Based Therapies for Lung Cancer: Opportunities and Challenges?
T2  - BIOMOLECULES
M3  - Review
AB  - Lung cancer is a commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths, posing a serious health risk. Despite new advances in immune checkpoint and targeted therapies in recent years, the prognosis for lung cancer patients, especially those in advanced stages, remains poor. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to modulate tumor development at multiple levels, and as such, miRNA mimics and molecules aimed at regulating miRNAs have shown promise in preclinical development. More importantly, miRNA-based therapies can also complement conventional chemoradiotherapy, immunotherapy, and targeted therapies to reverse drug resistance and increase the sensitivity of lung cancer cells. Furthermore, small interfering RNA (siRNA) and miRNA-based therapies have entered clinical trials and have shown favorable development prospects. Therefore, in this paper, we review recent advances in miRNA-based therapies in lung cancer treatment as well as adjuvant therapy and present the current state of clinical lung cancer treatment. We also discuss the challenges facing miRNA-based therapies in the clinical application of lung cancer treatment to provide new ideas for the development of novel lung cancer therapies.

TI  - Vaccination therapy for non-small-cell lung cancer: review of agents in phase III development
T2  - ANNALS OF ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The historical results of cancer vaccination for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were disappointing. In the current decade, however, new insights in the interaction between tumours and the immune system have led to the development of immunotherapy as a fundamentally new concept for the treatment of NSCLC. Modern NSCLC vaccine strategies rely on better identification of antigenic targets, addition of strong immunoadjuvants, and use of more efficient delivery systems. These treatments have convincingly demonstrated to elicit potent immune responses and have shown promising efficacy signals and excellent tolerability in phase II randomised studies. This-together with recent positive phase III data in indications other than NSCLC-has helped to establish the proof of principle for cancer vaccination. In NSCLC, ongoing phase III trials are investigating this approach in different treatment settings: the Melanoma AntiGEn A3 vaccine in resected early-stage NSCLC, the L-BLP25 vaccine in locally advanced NSCLC after chemoradiotherapy, and belagenpumatucel-L, the epidermal growth factor and the TG4010 vaccine in advanced stage, either as an adjunct to chemotherapy or as maintenance after completion of chemotherapy. Mode of action, development, available clinical data, and currently ongoing phase III studies are reviewed.

TI  - Survival benefit from immunocheckpoint inhibitors in stage IV non-small cell lung cancer patients with brain metastases: A National Cancer Database propensity-matched analysis
T2  - CANCER MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Immunocheckpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have become a standard pharmacological therapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Because brain metastases (BMs) have historically been listed as exclusion criteria in previous clinical trials involving ICIs in advanced NSCLC, the survival benefit from ICI in NSCLC patients with BMs remains unclear. The National Cancer Database was queried for stage IV NSCLC patients with or without BMs between 2014 and 2015. Overall survival (OS) of stage IV NSCLC patients who received immunotherapy and that of stage IV NSCLC patients who did not receive immunotherapy were compared according to the presence or absence of BMs. Multivariable logistic analyses identified the clinical characteristics predictive of overall survival. A propensity score analysis was conducted with the aim of adjusting the potential biases arising from the clinical characteristics. This study included 42,512 patients with stage IV NSCLC; 11,810 patients with BMs and 30,702 patients without BMs. In univariate analysis, stage IV NSCLC patients with BMs treated with immunotherapy had a significantly longer OS than those without immunotherapy after propensity score matching (median OS: 12.8 vs 10.1 months, hazard ratio [HR]: 0.80, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.72-0.89, p < 0.0001). Multivariable Cox modeling after propensity score matching confirmed the survival benefit from ICI for stage IV NSCLC patients with BMs (HR: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.67-0.83, p < 0.0001). The HR in NSCLC patients without BMs treated with ICI compared with those without ICI was 0.77 (95% CI: 0.73-0.82, p < 0.0001). Survival in stage IV NSCLC patients with BMs was significantly improved by ICI treatment at levels comparable to those without BMs using a retrospective database. ICI may be one of the promising treatment options for stage IV NSCLC patients with BMs. These findings should be validated in future prospective studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The advances in the lung cancer screening methods and therapeutics, together with awareness towards deleterious habits, such as smoking, is increasing the overall survival with better quality of life for the patients. However, lung cancer is still one of the most common and fatal neoplasm with a high incidence and consequently burden to public health worldwide. Thus, based on guidelines and recent phases II and III clinical trials studies, this manuscript summarizes the current treatment sequencing strategies in lung cancer.METHODS: A comprehensive search of related articles was performed focused on phases II and III clinical trials studies.RESULTS: The lung cancer management should take into consideration the tumor characteristics, histology, molecular pathology and be discussed in a multidisciplinary team. Lung cancer treatment options comprises surgery whenever possible, radiotherapy associate with/or chemotherapy and immunotherapy as monotherapy, or combined with chemotherapy and best palliative care.CONCLUSIONS: The screening predictability in more patients, smoking reduction, early diagnosis, better disease understanding and individualized, more effective and tolerable therapeutics are related to an increasing in overall survival and quality of life. In the near future improvement of personalized therapy in precision medicine is expected, enhancing new predictive biomarkers, optimal doses and optimal treatment sequencing as well as anti-cancer vaccines development.

TI  - Interdisciplinary multimodality management of stage III nonsmall cell lung cancer
T2  - EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY REVIEW
M3  - Review
AB  - Stage III nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) comprises about one-third of NSCLC patients and is very heterogeneous with varying and mostly poor prognosis. It is also called "locoregionally or locally advanced disease". Due to its heterogeneity a general schematic management approach is not appropriate. Usually a combination of local therapy (surgery or radiotherapy, depending on functional, technical and oncological operability) with systemic platinum-based doublet chemotherapy and, recently, followed by immune therapy is used. A more aggressive approach of triple agent chemotherapy or two local therapies (surgery and radiotherapy, except for specific indications) has no benefit for overall survival. Until now tumour stage and the general condition of the patient are the most relevant prognostic factors. Characterising the tumour molecularly and immunologically may lead to a more personalised and effective approach. At the moment, after an exact staging and functional evaluation, an interdisciplinary discussion amongst the tumour board is warranted and offers the best management strategy.

TI  - Measured Steps: Navigating the Path of Oligoprogressive Lung Cancer with Targeted and Immunotherapies
T2  - CURRENT ONCOLOGY REPORTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of ReviewThis review discusses the definitions, treatment modalities, management, future directions, and ongoing clinical trials of oligoprogressive disease in oncogene-driven and non-oncogene-driven NSCLC.Recent FindingsDuring the last decades, diagnostic and treatment modalities for oligometastatic NSCLC have advanced significantly, leading to improved survival. Additionally, our understanding of the tumor biology of oligoprogressive disease has expanded. However, despite the efforts of organizations, such as EORTC, ESTRO, and ASTRO proposing definitions for oligometastatic and oligoprogressive disease, heterogeneity in definitions persists in (ongoing) trials.SummaryRecognizing the significance of subclassification within oligoprogressive disease in NSCLC and the varying risks associated with subsequent metastatic spread, there is a call for tailored management strategies. A consensus on standardized criteria for the definition of oligoprogressive disease is urgently needed and will not only facilitate meaningful comparisons between studies but also pave the way for the development of personalized treatment plans that take into account the heterogeneous nature of oligoprogressive disease.

TI  - Dendritic cell vaccine and cytokine-induced killer cell therapy for the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer
T2  - ONCOLOGY LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study aimed to evaluate the survival time, immune response and safety of a dendritic cell (DC) vaccine and cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cell therapy (DC-CIK) in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The present retrospective study enrolled 507 patients with advanced NSCLC; 99 patients received DC-CIK [immunotherapy group (group I)] and 408 matched patients did not receive DC-CIK, and acted as the control [non-immunotherapy group (group NI)]. Delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH), quality of life (QOL) and safety were analyzed in group I. The follow-up period for the two groups was 489.2 +/- 160.4 days. The overall survival (OS) time was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. DTH was observed in 59 out of 97 evaluated patients (60.8%) and 67 out of 98 evaluated patients (68.4%) possessed an improved QOL. Fever and a skin rash occurred in 36 out of 98 patients (36.7%) and 7 out of 98 patients (7.1%) in group I. DTH occurred more frequently in patients with squamous cell carcinoma compared with patients with adenocarcinoma (77.1 vs. 40.4%; P=0.0013). Radiotherapy was not associated with DC-CIK-induced DTH (72.7 vs. 79.6%; P=0.18), but chemotherapy significantly reduced the rate of DTH (18.2 vs. 79.6%; P=0.00). The OS time was significantly increased in group I compared with group NI (P=0.03). In conclusion, DC-CIK may induce an immune response against NSCLC, improve the QOL, and prolong the OS time of patients, without adverse effects. Therefore, the present study recommends DC-CIK for the treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC.

TI  - A short-term follow-up CT based radiomics approach to predict response to immunotherapy in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer
T2  - ONCOIMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - To develop a short-term follow-up CT-based radiomics approach to predict response to immunotherapy in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and investigate the prognostic value of radiomics features in predicting progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). We first retrospectively collected 224 advanced NSCLC patients from two centers, and divided them into a primary cohort and two validation cohorts respectively. Then, we processed CT scans with a series of image preprocessing techniques namely, tumor segmentation, image resampling, feature extraction and normalization. To select the optimal features, we applied the feature ranking with recursive feature elimination method. After resampling the training dataset with a synthetic minority oversampling technique, we applied the support vector machine classifier to build a machine-learning-based classification model to predict response to immunotherapy. Finally, we used Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival analysis method to evaluate prognostic value of rad-score generated by CT-radiomics model. In two validation cohorts, the delta-radiomics model significantly improved the area under receiver operating characteristic curve from 0.64 and 0.52 to 0.82 and 0.87, respectively (P < .05). In sub-group analysis, pre- and delta-radiomics model yielded higher performance for adenocarcinoma (ADC) patients than squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) patients. Through the KM survival analysis, the rad-score of delta-radiomics model had a significant prognostic for PFS and OS in validation cohorts (P < .05). Our results demonstrated that (1) delta-radiomics model could improve the prediction performance, (2) radiomics model performed better on ADC patients than SCC patients, (3) delta-radiomics model had prognostic values in predicting PFS and OS of NSCLC patients.

TI  - Durvalumab-Associated Pneumonitis in Patients with Locally Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Real-World Population Study
T2  - CURRENT ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The PACIFIC trial led to a new standard of care for patients with locally advanced lung cancer, but real-world practice has demonstrated that immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) pneumonitis can lead to significant clinical complications. This study aimed to examine the clinical predictors, outcomes, and healthcare utilization data in patients who received consolidation durvalumab. Using the Alberta Immunotherapy Database, NSCLC patients who received durvalumab in Alberta, Canada, from January 2018 to December 2021 were retrospectively evaluated. We examined incidence and predictive values of severe pneumonitis, with overall survival (OS) and time-to-treatment failure (TTF) using exploratory multivariate analyses. Of 189 patients, 91% were ECOG 0-1 and 85% had a partial response from chemoradiation prior to durvalumab. Median TTF and OS were not reached; 1-year OS was 82%. An amount of 26% developed any grade of pneumonitis; 9% had >= grade 3 pneumonitis. Male gender and a pre-existing autoimmune condition were associated with severe pneumonitis. V20 was associated with any grade of pneumonitis. Pneumonitis development was found to be an independent risk factor for worse OS (p = 0.038) and TTF (p = 0.007). Our results suggest clinical and dosimetric predictive factors of durvalumab-associated pneumonitis. These results affirm the importance of careful patient selection for safe completion of consolidation durvalumab in real-world LA-NSCLC population.

TI  - Immunotherapy in non-metastatic non-small cell lung cancer: Can the benefits of stage IV therapy be translated into earlier stages?
T2  - THERAPEUTIC ADVANCES IN MEDICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Over the last decade, several steps forward in the treatment of patients with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NCSLC) were made. Examples are the use of pemetrexed, pemetrexed maintenance therapy, or bevacizumab for patients with nonsquamous NSCLC. A big leap forward was the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in patients selected on the basis of an activating oncogene, such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activating mutations or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) translocations. However, all of these achievements could not be translated into survival benefits when studied in randomized controlled trials in patients with nonmetastatic NSCLC. Aside from chemotherapy and targeted therapy, immunotherapy has become the third pillar in the treatment armamentarium of advanced NSCLC. Antigen-specific immunotherapy (cancer vaccination) has been disappointing in large phase III clinical trials in stages I-III NSCLC. Based on the recent breakthroughs with immune checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy in metastatic NSCLC, much hope currently rests on the use of this approach in patients with stage I-III NSCLC as well. Here we give a brief overview of how most new therapeutic approaches for advanced NSCLC failed in other stages, and then elaborate on the role of immunotherapy in patients with stage I-III NSCLC.

TI  - Durvalumab Plus Concurrent Radiotherapy for Treatment of Locally Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer The DOLPHIN Phase 2 Nonrandomized Controlled Trial
T2  - JAMA ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - IMPORTANCE Administration of durvalumab after concurrent chemoradiotherapy is the standard treatment of unresectable, locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); however, 20% to 30% of patients do not receive durvalumab because of adverse events (AEs) during concurrent chemoradiotherapy. In addition, radiotherapy and immunotherapy have a synergistic effect. OBJECTIVE To investigate the efficacy and safety of durvalumab immunotherapy plus concurrent radiotherapy followed by maintenance with durvalumab therapy for treatment of locally advanced NSCLC without chemotherapy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The multicenter, single-arm DOLPHIN (Phase II Study of Durvalumab [MEDI4736] Plus Concurrent Radiation Therapy in Advanced Localized NSCLC Patients) nonrandomized controlled trial was performed by 12 institutions in Japan from September 13, 2019, to May 31, 2022. Participants in the primary registration phase included 74 patients with programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1)-positive, unresectable, locally advanced NSCLC. The current analyses were conducted from June 1, 2022, to October 31, 2022. INTERVENTIONS Patients received radiotherapy (60 Gy) in combination with concurrent and maintenance durvalumab immunotherapy, 10mg/kg every 2 weeks, for up to 1 year. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary end point of the rate of 12-month progression-free survival (PFS), as assessed by an independent central review, was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and evaluated with 90% CIs calculated using the Greenwood formula. The key secondary end points were PFS, objective response rate, treatment completion rate, and AEs. RESULTS Data from 35 patients (median [range] age, 72 [44-83] years; 31 [88.6%] men) were included in the full analysis set of the evaluable population. The 12-month PFS rate was 72.1% (90% CI, 59.1%-85.1%), and the median PFS was 25.6 months (95% CI, 13.1 months to not estimable) at a median follow-up of 22.8 months (range, 4.3-31.8 months). Scheduled radiation therapy was completed in 97.1% of patients. The confirmed objective response rate was 90.9%(95% CI, 75.7%-98.1%), and the treatment completion rate was 57.6%(95% CI, 39.2%-74.5%). Among 34 patients evaluated in the safety analysis set, AEs of grade 3 or 4 occurred in 18 patients (52.9%), and of grade 5 in 2 patients (5.9%). Pneumonitis or radiation pneumonitis of any grade occurred in 23 patients (67.6%), and of grades 3 or 4 in 4 patients (11.8%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Findings from this phase 2 nonrandomized controlled trial indicate that durvalumab immunotherapy combined with curative radiotherapy for patients with PD-L1-positive, unresectable, locally advanced NSCLC is a promising treatment with tolerable AEs and is appropriate as a study treatment for phase 3 clinical trials.

T2  - EXPERT REVIEW OF ANTICANCER THERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Stage IIIA-N2 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents a heterogeneous group of bronchogenic carcinomas with locoregional involvement. Different categories of N2 disease exist, ranging from unexpectedly encountered N2 involvement after detailed preoperative staging or surprise' N2, to potentially resectable disease treated within a combined modality setting, and finally, bulky N2 involvement treated by chemoradiation.Areas covered: Large randomised controlled trials and meta-analyses on stage IIIA-N2 NSCLC have been published but their implications for treatment remain a matter of debate. No definite recommendations can be provided as diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms vary according to local, national or international guidelines.Expert commentary: From the literature, it is clear that patients with stage IIIA-N2 NSCLC should be treated by combined modality therapy including chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery. The relative contribution of each modality has not been firmly established. For patients undergoing induction therapy, adequate restaging is important as only down-staged patients will clearly benefit from surgical resection. Each patient should be discussed within a multidisciplinary team to determine the best diagnostic and therapeutic approach according to the specific local expertise. In the near future, it might be expected that targeted therapies and immunotherapy will be incorporated as possible therapeutic options.

T2  - General thoracic and cardiovascular surgery
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - Despite recent advances in surgery, irradiation, and chemotherapy, the prognosis of patients with lung cancer is still poor. Therefore, the development and application of new therapeutic strategies are essential for improving the prognosis of this disease. Significant progress in our understanding of tumor immunology and molecular biology has allowed us to identify the tumor-associated antigens recognized by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Immune responses and tumor-associated antigens against not only malignant melanoma but also lung cancer have been elucidated at the molecular level. In a theoretical sense, tumor eradication is considered possible through antigen-based immunotherapy against such diseases. However, many clinical trials of cancer vaccination with defined tumor antigens have resulted in objective clinical responses in only a small number of patients. Tumor escape mechanisms from host immune surveillance remain a major obstacle for cancer immunotherapy. A better understanding of the immune escape mechanisms employed by tumor cells is necessary before we can develop a more effective immunotherapeutic approach to lung cancer. We review recent studies regarding the identification of tumor antigens in lung cancer, tumor immune escape mechanisms, and clinical vaccine trials in lung cancer.

T2  - JAPANESE JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The perioperative treatments for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) should control both local and microscopic systemic disease, because the survival of patients with NSCLC who underwent surgical resection alone has been dismal except in stage IA patients. One way to improve surgical outcome is the administration of chemotherapy before or after the surgical procedure. During the last two decades, many clinical studies have focused on developing optimal adjuvant or neoadjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens that can be combined with surgical treatment and/or radiotherapy. Based on the results of those clinical studies, multimodality therapy has been considered to be an appropriate treatment approach for locally advanced NSCLC patients. When nodal involvement is discovered postoperatively, adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy has conferred an overall survival benefit. More recently, neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant use of immunotherapy adding to the cisplatin-based chemotherapy has been revealed to improve survival of the patients with locally advanced NSCLC in many large-scale clinical trials; although, optimal treatment strategies are still evolving.The author reviewed the results of clinical studies focused on developing optimal adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy regimens with or without immunotherapy for advanced lung cancer that can be combined with surgical treatment.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of personalized optimal PD-(L)1 combinations in advanced NSCLC: a network meta-analysis
T2  - JNCI-JOURNAL OF THE NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Programmed death 1 (PD-1)/programmed death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1)-directed immunotherapy has revolutionized the treatments for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), whereas the optimal therapeutic combinations remain uncertain. Methods Our study encompassed phase II/III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that involved anti-PD-(L)1-based therapies for stage-IV NSCLC. The primary outcomes included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), and incidences of adverse events. Subgroup analyses were conducted by treatment lines, PD-L1 expression levels, histological types, and metastatic sites. Results Our analysis incorporated 38 publications, covering 14 therapeutic combinations and involving 18 048 participants. PD-(L)1+chemotherapy (CT), PD-(L)1+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA4) +CT, and PD-(L)1+ T-cell immunoglobulin and ITIM domain were notably effective in prolonging OS. Overall, PD-(L)1+CT and PD-(L)1+CT+ vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were significantly beneficial for PFS and ORR. As for the subsequent-line treatments, incorporating radiotherapy can enhance PFS and ORR (ranked fourth among enrolled treatments). For patients with PD-L1 <1%, PD-(L)1+CT+VEGF and PD-(L)1+CTLA4+CT were favorable approaches. Conversely, in patients with PD-L1 >= 50%, PD-(L)1+CT represented an effective treatment. Patients with nonsquamous cell carcinoma or liver metastases might benefit from the addition of VEGF. In cases of squamous cell carcinoma or brain metastases, the combination of PD-(L)1+CTLA4+CT yielded superior benefits. Conclusions This study underscores the enhanced efficacy of combination immunotherapies over monotherapy. It highlights the necessity for personalized treatment, considering individual factors. These insights are vital for clinical decision making in the management of advanced NSCLC.

TI  - Long survival of patients with small cell lung cancer after adjuvant treatment with the anti-idiotypic antibody BEC2 plus <i>Bacillus Calmette-Guerin</i>
T2  - CLINICAL CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite active therapies for small cell lung cancer (SCLC), most patients relapse and die of the disease. The present study evaluates immunization using the anti-idiotypic antibody BEC2, which mimics the ganglioside GD3 expressed on the surface of most SCLC tumors, combined with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) as an immune adjuvant, We hypothesized that active immunization could alter the natural history of the disease, Fifteen patients who had completed standard therapy for SCLC received a series of five intradermal immunizations consisting of 2.5 mg of BEC2 plus BCG over a 10-week period. Blood was collected for serological analysis, and outcome was monitored, All patients developed anti-BEC2 antibodies, despite having received chemotherapy with or without thoracic radiation. We detected anti-GD3 antibodies in five patients, including those with the longest relapse-free survival. The median relapse-free survival for patients with extensive stage disease is II months and has not been reached for patients with limited stage disease (>47 months), with only one of seven patients having relapsed after a median follow-up of 47 months. Immunization of patients with SCLC after standard therapy using BEC2 plus BCG can induce anti-GD3 antibodies and is safe. The survival and relapse-free survival in this group of patients are substantially better than those observed in a prior group of similar patients. A Phase III trial is being conducted to evaluate BEC2 plus BCG as adjuvant therapy after chemotherapy and irradiation.

TI  - Durvalumab: a potential maintenance therapy in surgery-ineligible non-small-cell lung cancer
T2  - CANCER MANAGEMENT AND RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Lung cancer is the most common cancer worldwide and the most common cause of cancer-related death. Non-small-cell lung cancer comprises similar to 87% of newly diagnosed cases of lung cancer, and nearly one-third of these patients have stage III disease. Despite improvements in the treatment of stage IV lung cancer, particularly with the introduction and dissemination of checkpoint inhibitors, very little progress has been made in the treatment of stage III lung cancer. In this article, we discuss the general staging criteria and treatment options for stage III lung cancer. We review how concurrent radiation and chemotherapy can have immunomodulatory effects, supporting the rationale for incorporating immunotherapy into existing treatment paradigms. Finally, we discuss the results of the PACIFIC trial and implications for the treatment of stage III lung cancer. In the PACIFIC trial, adding durvalumab as a maintenance therapy following the completion of chemoradiotherapy improved progression-free survival in patients with locally advanced unresectable stage III lung cancer. On the strength of these results, durvalumab has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use in this setting, representing the first advance in the treatment of stage III lung cancer in nearly a decade.

TI  - Efficacy of early combination of local radiotherapy and GM-CSF for advanced non-small cell lung cancer treated with icotinib
T2  - IRISH JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Lung cancer is a disease that severely endangers human health. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 4/5 of lung cancers. Aims To investigate the efficacy of early combination of local radiotherapy and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) for advanced NSCLC treated with icotinib. Methods Forty-two patients with stage IV NSCLC complicated with EGFR gene mutation were selected and randomly divided into two groups, with 21 patients in each group. Patients in control group were treated with icotinib, and patients in experimental group were treated with icotinib combined with local radiotherapy and subcutaneous injection of GM-CSF. One-year progression free survival between two groups was compared. Results Three months after treatment, the efficacy in experimental group was significantly better than that in control group, and objective response rate was 95.24% in experimental group, which was higher than the 71.43% in control group. Patients in experimental group had no differences in white blood cell and neutrophil, but had significantly lower carcino-embryonic antigen and neuron-specific enolase levels and higher CD3+, CD4+, and CD4+/CD8+ than those in control group and before treatment. There were no differences in the proportion of patients with adverse reactions between two groups. One-year progression free survival was significantly better in experimental group than in control group. Conclusions Early combination of local radiotherapy and GM-CSF has a significant efficacy for advanced NSCLC accounts for approximately 4/5 of lung cancers treated with icotinib, and it can improve patients' autoimmunity and lengthen progression free survival.

AB  - Background: Cetuximab has demonstrated synergy with taxanes in preclinical models; as well as single agent activity. We assessed the activity of cetuximab with carboplatin and paclitaxel given on a 4-week schedule, in advanced, chemo-naive non-small cell lung cancer.Patients and Methods: This phase II, single arm, multi-institution day 1, then Study featured standard dosage of cetuximab 400 mg/m(2) 250 mg/m(2) with paclitaxel (100 mg/m(2)/wk, For 3 weeks), and carboplatin (area under curve = 6) day 1 of each 28 clay cycle. After 4 to 6 cycles, in the absence of disease progression or excess toxicity, cetuximab was Continued weekly. Primary end point was response rate.Results: Fifty-three patients (median age 63, 51% male) participated. Response rate was 57% (3 complete response and 27 partial response). At a median follow-up of 12.5 months, the estimated overall Survival is 13.8 months (95% CI: 9.08-16.02) with an event-free survival rate of 5.53 months (95% CI: 4.77-7.99) 18.9% remain free from progression at 1 year. Improved survival was associated with female gender, absence of prior radiation, PS 0 and epidermal growth factor receptor expression. Toxicities included rash (28% grade 3), nail changes (3.7% grade 3). hypomagnesemia (7.5% grade 3 and 3.7% grade 4), and neutropenia (25% grade 3 and 13% grade 4) in addition to other typical side effects anticipated with paclitaxel/carboplatin. There were no grade 5 toxicities.Conclusion: Combination of cetuximab/paclitaxel/carboplatin in non-small cell lung cancer was well tolerated and clinically active with manageable toxicities. This unique schedule, integrating weekly paclitaxel and cetuximab has not yet been tested in a randomized trial.

AB  - INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND: Systemic treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is shifting from platinum-based chemotherapy to immunotherapy and targeted therapies associated with improved survival in clinical trials. As new therapies are approved for use, examining variations in use for treating patients in community practice can generate additional evidence as to the magnitude of their benefit.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified 1,442 patients diagnosed with de novo stage IV NSCLC between 3/1/2012 and 12/31/2020. Patient characteristics and treatment patterns are described overall and by type of first- and second-line systemic therapy received. Prevalence ratios estimate the association of patient and tumor characteristics with receipt of first-line therapy.RESULTS: Within 180 days of diagnosis, 949 (66%) patients received first-line systemic therapy, increasing from 53% in 2012 to 71% in 2020 (p=0.0004). The proportion of patients receiving first-line immunotherapy+/-chemotherapy (IMO) increased from 14%-66% (p<0.0001). Overall, 380 (26%) patients received both first- and second-line treatment, varying by year between 16%-36% (p=0.18). The proportion of patients receiving second-line IMO increased from 13%-37% (p<0.0001). Older age and current smoking status were inversely associated with receipt of first-line therapy. Higher BMI, receipt of radiation, and diagnosis year were positively associated with receipt of first-line therapy. No association was found for race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status.CONCLUSION: The proportion of advanced NSCLC patients receiving first- and second-line treatment increased over time, particularly for IMO treatments. Additional research is needed to better understand the impact of these therapies on patient outcomes, including short-term, long-term, and financial toxicities.MICROABSTRACT: Systemic treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is shifting from platinum-based therapies to immunotherapy and targeted therapies. Using de novo stage IV NSCLC patients identified from 4 healthcare systems, we examine trends in systemic therapy. We saw an increase in the portion of patients receiving any systemic therapy and a sharp increase in the proportion of patients receiving immunotherapy.

TI  - Current and Future Treatment Options in the Management of Stage III NSCLC
T2  - JOURNAL OF THORACIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - For much of the past two decades, the treatment options for patients with stage III NSCLC were mostly stagnant. In the past 5 years, ongoing innovations have dovetailed alongside advances in biomarker testing, novel therapeutics, precision surgery, and radiotherapy, all of which are leading to an increase in more personalized option for the treatment. This review article will focus on several completed and ongoing initiatives involving treatment of patients with stage III NSCLC. First, it will tackle the progress made in curative treatment of unresectable stage III NSCLC, starting with PACIFIC, and branching out into topics such as concurrent immunotherapy and chemoradiation, intensification of consolidative immunotherapy, dual immunotherapy consolidation, and a reflection on those subpopulations that may not benefit from consolidative immunotherapy. Second, there will be discussion of novel strategies in the setting of resectable stage III disease, most notably neoadjuvant therapy using combined chemo-immunotherapy and immunotherapy alone before surgical resection. Third, it will delve into recent data evaluating adjuvant immunotherapy for resectable stage III NSCLC, including adjuvant targeted therapy (for those harboring driver mutations) and postoperative radiotherapy. Finally, a look to future trials/initiatives will be interspersed throughout the review, to reveal the ongoing efforts being made to continue to improve outcomes in this group of patients.

TI  - Therapeutic approaches for LKB1-deficient non-small cell lung cancer
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Therapeutic advances have been made in the treatment of subpopulations of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who harbor specific genomic alterations (e.g. EGFR mutation and ALK ROS gene rearrangements) which can be targeted with small molecule kinase inhibitors; however, the serine/threonine kinase STK11 (LKB1) is the second most commonly altered tumor suppressors in NSCLC, with genomic loss or inactivating mutations occurring in 20-30% of lung adenocarcinoma and there are currently no treatment strategies tailored for LKB1-deficient NSCLC. The PIs have developed preliminary data showing that in human tumor specimens and in Genetically Engineered Mouse Models of NSCLC with Lkb1 deletion that loss of LKB1 is associated with higher stage of disease at presentation, increased metastasis and poor overall prognosis as well as unique biological characteristics. This proposal will deeply characterize the distinct biology of LKB1- deficient NSCLCs with a focus on the immune microenvironment as a means to develop novel therapeutic approaches for patients with LKB1-deficient NSCLCs.

TI  - Molecular testing in stage I-III non-small cell lung cancer: Approaches and challenges
T2  - LUNG CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Precision medicine in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a rapidly evolving area, with the development of targeted therapies for advanced disease and concomitant molecular testing to inform clinical decision-making. In contrast, routine molecular testing in stage I-III disease has not been required, where standard of care comprises surgery with or without adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy, or concurrent chemoradiotherapy for unresectable stage III disease, without the integration of targeted therapy. However, the phase 3 ADAURA trial has recently shown that the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), osimertinib, reduces the risk of disease recurrence by 80% versus placebo in the adjuvant setting for patients with stage IB-IIIA EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC following complete tumor resection with or without adjuvant chemotherapy, according to physician and patient choice. Treatment with adjuvant osimertinib requires selection of patients based on the presence of an EGFR-TKI sensitizing mutation. Other targeted agents are currently being evaluated in the adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings. Approval of at least some of these other agents is highly likely in the coming years, bringing with it in parallel, a requirement for comprehensive molecular testing for stage I-III disease. In this review, we consider the implications of integrating molecular testing into practice when managing patients with stage I-III non-squamous NSCLC. We discuss best practices, approaches and challenges from pathology, surgical and oncology perspectives.

TI  - Safety Related to the Timing of Radiotherapy and Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in Patients with Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Single Institutional Experience
T2  - CURRENT ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The safety impact of radiotherapy (RT) timing relative to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is unclear. We investigated if RT within 14 days (Interval 1) and 90 days (Interval 2) of ICI use is associated with toxicities compared to RT outside these intervals. Methods: Advanced NSCLC patients treated with both RT and ICIs were reviewed. Toxicities were graded as per CTCAE v4.0 and attributed to either ICIs or RT by clinicians. Associations between RT timing and Grade >= 2 toxicities were analyzed using logistic regression models adjusted for patient, disease, and treatment factors (alpha = 0.05). Results: Sixty-four patients were identified. Twenty received RT within Interval 1 and 40 within Interval 2. There were 20 Grade >= 2 toxicities in 18 (28%) patients; pneumonitis (6) and nausea (2) were most prevalent. One treatment-related death (immune encephalitis) was observed. Rates of patients with Grade >= 2 toxicities were 35%/25% in the group with/without RT within Interval 1 and 30%/25% in the group with/without RT within Interval 2. No significant association between RT timing relative to ICI use period and Grade >= 2 toxicities was observed. Conclusion: Albeit limited by the small sample size, the result suggested that pausing ICIs around RT use may not be necessary.

TI  - Evolving Therapeutic Scenario of Stage III Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer
T2  - CLINICAL MEDICINE INSIGHTS-ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related death with an incidence that continues to increase in both sexes and all ages. However, 80% to 90% of lung cancers are non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and the remaining 10% to 20% are small cell lung cancer. Adenocarcinoma is the most common histologic subtype of lung cancer worldwide. More frequently, lung cancer diagnosis is made in advanced stages. Stage III NSCLC refers to locoregionally advanced disease without metastases and represents about 30% NSCLC cases. Despite the absence of metastases at diagnosis, the outcome is generally poor. Stage III comprises a heterogeneous group and optimal management requires the input of a multidisciplinary team. All modalities of oncologic treatment are involved: surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and more recently, immunotherapy and targeted therapy. We will discuss the different therapeutic options in stage III NSCLC, both in operable and inoperable scenarios, and the role of immunotherapy and targeted therapy.

TI  - Complete pathological response in locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer patient: A case report
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF CLINICAL CASES
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND Chemotherapy and radiotherapy followed by durvalumab is currently the standard treatment for locally advanced node-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We describe the case of a patient with locally advanced node-positive NSCLC (LA-NSCLC) treated in a phase II prospective protocol with chemotherapy, accelerated hypofractionated radiotherapy (AHRT) and surgery in the pre-immunotherapy era.CASE SUMMARY A 69-year-old male, ex-smoker (20 PY), with a Karnofsky performance status of 90, was diagnosed with locally advanced squamous cell lung carcinoma. He was staged by total body computed tomography (CT) scanning, and integrated F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT scan [cT4 cN3 cM0, stage IIIC according to TNM (tumor-node-metastasis) 8(th) edition] and received AHRT between chemotherapy cycles, in accordance with the study protocol (EudractCT registration 2008-006525-14). At the end of the study the patient underwent surgery, which was not part of the protocol, and showed a complete pathological response.CONCLUSION This case report confirms that AHRT can be used successfully to treat primary LA-NSCLC with bilateral mediastinal lymph node involvement. Our case is of particular interest because of the pathological response after AHRT and the lack of surgical complications. We hypothesize that this radiotherapeutic approach, with its proven efficacy, could be delivered as a short course reducing treatment costs, increasing patient compliance and reducing toxicity. We are currently investigating the possibility of combining hypofractionation, chemotherapy and immunotherapy for patients with LA-NSCLC.

TI  - Factors associated with overall survival, progression-free survival and toxicity in patients with small cell lung cancer and thoracic irradiation in a clinical real-world setting
T2  - RADIATION ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a malignant tumor known for its poor prognosis. In addition to chemotherapy and immunotherapy irradiation plays a big role especially in inoperability. This study evaluated prognostic factors in patients with SCLC, receiving chemotherapy and thoracic irradiation, that may affect overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and toxicity.Methods Patients with limited disease (LD) SCLC (n = 57) and extensive disease (ED) SCLC (n = 69) who received thoracic radiotherapy were analyzed retrospectively. The prognostic factors sex, age, Karnofsky performance status (KPS), tumor-, nodal-stage and timepoint of start of irradiation in relation to the first cycle of chemotherapy were evaluated. Start of irradiation was stratified as early (<= 2 cycles of chemotherapy), late (3 or 4 cycles) and very late (>= 5 cycles). Results were analyzed by Cox univariate and multivariate as well as logistic regression analysis.Results The median OS of LD-SCLC patients was 23.7 months in early, and 22.0 months in late start of irradiation. In very late start, median OS was not reached. PFS was 11.8, 15.2 and 47.9 months, respectively. In patients with ED-SCLC OS was 4.3 months in early, 13.0 months in late and 12.2 months in very late start of irradiation. PFS was 6.7, 13.0 and 12.2 months, respectively. Prognosis of patients with LD-or ED-SCLC receiving late or very late start of irradiation was significantly prolonged in OS and PFS compared to an early start (p < 0.05). KPS >= 80 shows a significant increase of OS and PFS in ED-SCLC. Female sex and smaller mean lung dose were associated with lower risk of toxicity.Conclusion Late or very late start of irradiation is a prognosis-enhancing factor in LD-SCLC and ED-SCLC for OS and PFS. KPS >= 80 increases prognosis of OS and PFS in ED-SCLC as well. Toxicity is less common in female sex and patients with low mean lung dose in LD-SCLC.

TI  - Non-small cell lung cancer: epidemiology, screening, diagnosis, and treatment
T2  - AIMS MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Lung cancer is the most common cancer worldwide and is also one of the leading causes of cancer related deaths. The 5-year survival rate depends largely on stage at diagnosis. Multiple large randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the clinical utility of lung cancer screening. Low dose computed tomography is recommended for lung cancer screening in several guidelines. Lung cancer is often diagnosed at more advanced stages owing to the nonspecific symptoms with which it presents. Diagnosis relies primarily upon imaging and biopsy. Diagnosis and staging should be performed simultaneously, if possible, by performing a biopsy at the site that will confer the highest stage. Sufficient material should be obtained to allow for molecular testing. Liquid biopsy may have a complementary role in detecting actionable mutations in non-small cell lung cancer. Treatment is predicated upon stage and may involve surgery, targeted chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, or some combination thereof.

TI  - Negative correlations of psychological distress with quality of life and immunotherapy efficacy in patients with advanced NSCLC
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - To evaluate the relationships between psychological distress and immunotherapy efficacy, adverse reactions and quality of life scores in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A total of 104 NSCLC patients who received 4-6 cycles of standard immunotherapy were enrolled and evaluated with the Distress Thermometer (DT) and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30). The aim was to analyze the correlation between psychological distress and quality of life and to analyze whether psychological distress affects the efficacy of and adverse reactions to immunotherapy. The objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) of the psychological distress group were 6% and 50%, respectively, and those of the no psychological distress group were 18.5% and 83.3%, respectively. The differences were statistically significant (chi(2) =14.131, P<0.05). The progression-free survival (PFS) of advanced NSCLC patients who received comprehensive immunotherapy and had no psychological distress was significantly better than that of the psychological distress group (HR, 0.338; 95% CI, 0.192-0.592; P<0.05). The PFS of advanced NSCLC patients who received immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy in the no psychological distress group was significantly better than that in the psychological distress group (HR, 0.458; 95% CI, 0.296-0.709; P<0.05). Psychological distress in advanced NSCLC patients affects the efficacy of immunotherapy, and psychological distress is negatively correlated with quality of life during immunotherapy.

TI  - Revisiting neoadjuvant therapy in non-small-cell lung cancer
T2  - LANCET ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Despite the rapidly evolving treatment landscape in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), developments in neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatments have been nascent by comparison. Establishing overall survival benefit in the early-stage setting has been challenging because of the need for large trials and long-term survival data. Encouraged by improved treatment outcomes with a biomarker-driven approach in advanced NSCLC, and recognising the need to improve survival outcomes in early-stage NSCLC, there has been renewed interest in revisiting neoadjuvant strategies. Multiple neoadjuvant trials with targeted therapy and immunotherapy, either alone or in combination with chemotherapy, have yielded unique insights into traditional response parameters, such as the discordance between RECIST response and pathological response, and expanded opportunities for biomarker discovery. With further standardisation of trial endpoints across studies, coupled with the implementation of novel technologies including radiomics and digital pathology, individual risk-stratified neoadjuvant treatment approaches are poised to make a striking impact on the outcomes of early-stage NSCLC.

TI  - Multimodality Treatment of Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer: Where are we with the Evidence?
T2  - Current surgery reports
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The majority of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) present with advanced disease and overall survival rates are poor. This article outlines the current and outstanding evidence for the use of multimodality treatment in this group of patients, including in combination with an increasing number of treatment options, such as immunotherapy and genotype-targeted small molecule inhibitors.RECENT FINDINGS: Optimal therapy for surgically resectable stage III disease remains debatable and currently the choice of treatment reflects each individual patient's disease characteristics and the expertise and opinion of the thoracic multi-disciplinary team. Evidence for a distinct oligometastatic state in which improved outcomes can be achieved remains minimal and there is as yet no consensus definition for oligometastatic lung cancer. Whilst there is supporting evidence for the aggressive management of isolated metastases, the use of consolidative therapy for multiple metastases remains unproven.SUMMARY: Evolution of new RT technologies, improved surgical technique and a plethora of interventional-radiology-guided ablative therapies are widening the choice of available treatment modalities to patients with NSCLC. In the setting of resectable locally advanced disease and the oligometastatic state, there is a growing need for randomised comparison of the available treatment modalities to guide both treatment and patient selection.

TI  - Alteration of PD-L1 expression and its prognostic impact after concurrent chemoradiation therapy in non-small cell lung cancer patients
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CCRT) is the treatment of choice for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC). Several clinical trials that combine programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) axis inhibitors with radiotherapy are in development for patients with LA-NSCLC. However, the effect of CCRT on programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression on tumor cells is unknown. In this study, we analysed paired NSCLC specimens that had been obtained pre- and post-CCRT. PD-L1 expression on tumor cells was studied by immunohistochemistry. A total of 45 patients with LA-NSCLC were included, among which there were sufficient pre- and post-CCRT specimens in 35 patients. Overall, the percentage of tumor cells with PD-L1 expression significantly decreased between pre- and post-CCRT specimens (P = 0.024). Sixteen, 15, and 4 patients had decreased, unchanged, or increased PD-L1 expression after CCRT, respectively. Median OS of patients with decreased, unchanged, or increased PD-L1 expression was 85.1, 92.8, and 14.6 months, respectively (P < 0.001). In conclusion, the percentage of PD-L1-positive tumor cells significantly decreased after CCRT. Alteration of PD-L1 expression after neoadjuvant CCRT was associated with prognosis in patients with LA-NSCLC. These data should be considered when developing the optimal approach of integrating PD-1 axis inhibitors with CCRT.

TI  - Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors for the Treatment of Unresectable Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: Emerging Mechanisms and Perspectives
T2  - LUNG CANCER-TARGETS AND THERAPY
M3  - Review
AB  - There has been no improvement in outcome for patients with unresectable locally advanced (stage III) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) for more than 10 years. The standard treatment for these patients is definitive concurrent chemotherapy and radiation (CCRT). Although the goal of treatment in this setting is to achieve a cure, most patients progress and their prognosis is poor, with a 5-year survival rate of 15-30%. There is thus an urgent need for the development of novel anticancer treatments in this patient population. Recent advances in cancer immunotherapy have led to a marked improvement in clinical outcome for advanced NSCLC. Such immunotherapy mainly consists of the administration of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) such as antibodies to cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein-4 (CTLA-4) or to either programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) or its ligand PD-L1. Durvalumab (MEDI4736) is a high-affinity human immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody that blocks the binding of PD-L1 on tumor cells or antigen-presenting cells to PD-1 on T cells. The PACIFIC study recently evaluated consolidation immunotherapy with durvalumab versus placebo administered after concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) in patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC. It revealed a significant improvement in both progression-free and overall survival with durvalumab, and this improvement was associated with a favorable safety profile. This achievement has made durvalumab a standard of care for consolidation after CCRT in patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC, and it has now been approved in this setting by regulatory agencies in the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia, Switzerland, Malaysia, Singapore, India, and the United Arab Emirates. In this review, we briefly summarize the results of the PACIFIC trial, including those of post hoc analysis, and we address possible molecular mechanisms, perspectives, and remaining questions related to combined treatment with CCRT and ICIs in this patient population.

TI  - Role of Neoadjuvant Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in Resectable Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
T2  - PHARMACEUTICALS
M3  - Review
AB  - The neoadjuvant use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) in resectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is being increasingly adopted, but questions about the most appropriate applications remain. Although patients with resectable NSCLC are often treated with surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy or targeted therapies +/- radiotherapy, they still have a high risk of recurrence and death. In recent years, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) (anti-PD-1/PD-L1 and anti-CTLA-4) have provided a new and effective therapeutic strategy for the treatment of advanced NSCLC. Therefore, it is possible that ICIs for early-stage NSCLC may follow the pattern established in metastatic disease. Currently, there are several ongoing trials to determine the efficacy in the neoadjuvant setting for patients with local or regional disease. To date, only nivolumab in combination with chemotherapy has been approved by the U.S. FDA in the preoperative setting, but data continue to evolve rapidly, and treatment guidelines need to be determined. In this article, we review the current preclinical and clinical evidence on neoadjuvant ICIs alone and combination in the treatment of early-stage NSCLC.

The utility of agents such as immune checkpoint inhibitors highlights the importance of identifying key characteristics and treatment strategies that contribute to long-term survival and could help guide therapeutic decisions.<bold>Objective:</bold> This real-world analysis examines the characteristics, treatment patterns, and clinical outcomes of patients receiving chemotherapy without immunotherapy for ES-SCLC in Manitoba, Canada.<bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective cohort study assessed patient characteristics, treatment, and survival duration (short: <6 months; medium: 6-24 months; long: >24 months) using the Manitoba Cancer Registry and CancerCare Manitoba records. Eligible patients were aged >18 years with cytologically confirmed ES-SCLC diagnosed between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2018, and received cytotoxic chemotherapy (CT). The one-, two-, and five-year probabilities of overall survival (OS) were assessed relative to patient, disease, and treatment characteristics using Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox proportional hazards models.<bold>Results:</bold> This analysis included 537 patients. Cisplatin was used in 56.1% of patients, 45.6% received thoracic radiotherapy (RT), and few received prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI). In the overall cohort, one-, two- and five-year OS rates were 26%, 8%, and 3%, respectively. For patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) 0, OS rates at one, two, and five years were 43%, 17%, and 10%, respectively, vs. 27%, 8%, and 2% for those with ECOG PS 1-2, and 16%, 3%, and 3% for those with ECOG PS 3-4. In long-term survivors, ECOG PS scores were lower and abnormal laboratory test results were less frequent. Overall, 74.4% of long-term survivors received thoracic RT and 53.5% received PCI. Known poor prognostic factors - including brain/liver metastases, high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), abnormal sodium, and low hemoglobin levels - were less common but still seen in long-term survivors.<bold>Conclusion:</bold> Although rare, patients with ES-SCLC may experience long-term survival with CT +/- thoracic RT +/- PCI. Factors predicting long-term survival include traditional prognostic factors such as ECOG PS, LDH level, and receipt of thoracic RT or PCI. These findings support current treatment algorithms for ES-SCLC and provide baseline survival estimates to assess the real-world impact of adding immune checkpoint inhibitors in the future.

TI  - Clinical efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with brain metastases
T2  - IMMUNOTHERAPY
M3  - Review
AB  - Brain metastases (BMs) represent a negative prognostic factor for patients with solid malignancies. BMs are generally approached with loco-regional treatments and the blood-brain barrier limits the efficacy of some systemic drugs. The aim of this review is to summarize current knowledge about the role of immune checkpoint inhibitors for the management of brain metastases in patients with solid malignancies. We performed a review of available literature. Immune checkpoint inhibitors represent the standard treatment for several advanced solid malignancies. However, with the exception of melanoma their clinical role in other solid malignancies is not completely clear due to the exclusion of patients with BM from approval clinical trials. Immune-checkpoint inhibitors may be an effective treatment of brain metastases of melanoma while their clinical role on brain metastases from other solid malignancies is uncertain.

TI  - Pattern of failure and clinical value of local therapy for oligo-recurrence in locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer after definitive chemoradiation: Impact of driver mutation status
T2  - CANCER MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Considerable differences of treatment response and pattern of failure may exist between definitive chemoradiation (CRT) treated locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC) patients. The clinical value of additional tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) before disease recurrence and salvage local therapy after initial recurrent disease remain controversial. Methods and Materials: Consecutive LA-NSCLC patients receiving definitive CRT and having definite results about driver mutations (EGFR, ALK and ROS1) were retrospectively reviewed. Initial recurrent disease was classified as in-field recurrence, out-of-field recurrence and distant metastasis. Recurrent disease occurred only in the brain or limited to <= 3 extra-cranial organs and <= 5 extra-cranial lesions, was defined as oligo-recurrence. Progression free survival and overall survival (OS) were calculated from diagnosis to disease progression or death, and to death, respectively. OS2 was measured from initial disease recurrence to death among patients who had recurrent disease. Results: Of the 153 enrolled patients, 39 had driver mutations and 13 received additional TKI therapy besides definitive CRT. Patients harboring driver mutations but without additional TKI therapy had a similar PFS and significantly longer OS (p = 0.032) than those without driver mutations. Additional TKI therapy prolonged PFS (p = 0.021) but not OS among patients with driver mutations. No significant difference of pattern of failure was observed between patient subgroups stratified by the status of driver mutations and the usage of additional TKI therapy. Furthermore, 57 of the 95 patients with initial recurrent disease developed oligo-recurrence and salvage local therapy significantly improved OS2 (p = 0.01) among patients with oligo-recurrence disease. Conclusion: LA-NSCLC patients receiving definitive CRT generally had similar PFS and pattern of treatment failure, regardless of driver mutation status. Additional TKI therapy besides definitive CRT could prolong PFS but not OS. The majority of recurrent disease after definitive CRT belongs to oligo-recurrence and salvage local therapy may provide survival benefit.

TI  - Nivolumab plus ipilimumab with chemotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer with untreated brain metastases: A multicenter single-arm phase 2 trial (NIke, LOGiK 2004).
T2  - European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: The effect of dual immunotherapy combined with platinum-based chemotherapy on untreated brain metastases derived from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has remained unclear.METHODS: This multicenter single-arm phase 2 study enrolled patients with chemotherapy-naive advanced NSCLC and at least one brain metastasis ≥5 mm in size that had not been previously treated. Patients received nivolumab plus ipilimumab combined with platinum-doublet chemotherapy (two cycles), followed by nivolumab-ipilimumab alone. The primary endpoint of the study was intracranial response rate as determined by modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) for brain metastases of ≥5 mm as target lesions.RESULTS: A total of 30 patients from 18 institutions was enrolled in this study. The median age was 66.5 years (range, 47-83 years), and 26 patients (87%) had a non-squamous cell carcinoma histology. The median size of all target brain lesions was 8.4mm, with a range of 5-39mm. The intracranial response rate assessed by modified RECIST was 50.0% (95% CI, 33.2-66.8%), with the rate of complete response being 20.0%, and the study met its primary endpoint. The systemic response rate was 53.3% (95% CI, 36.1-69.8%), and responses for intracranial and extracranial lesions were generally consistent. The median intracranial progression-free survival was 8.1 months, and both the median intracranial duration of response and time to brain radiotherapy were not reached.CONCLUSION: Nivolumab plus ipilimumab combined with platinum-based chemotherapy showed promising intracranial activity in NSCLC patients with untreated brain metastases.TRIAL REGISTRATION: jRCT071210019.

TI  - Survival outcomes of targeted and immune consolidation therapies in locally advanced unresectable lung adenocarcinoma
T2  - INTERNATIONAL IMMUNOPHARMACOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Locally advanced non -small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC) presents unique challenges due to its progression and tumor heterogeneity. The effectiveness of consolidation therapies, particularly in patients with gene mutations, remains an area of active investigation. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we examined data from 3,454 patients with unresectable lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), narrowing our focus to 242 individuals with stage II/III. We gathered patient data, such as demographics, ECOG status, histology, treatment specifics, and gene expression, from patients in China. The study's primary outcome was overall survival (OS), while progression-free survival (PFS) served as the secondary outcome. Results: In this study, 50 % of the 242 patients underwent only radical chemoradiotherapy, with 45.87 % (111/ 242) exhibiting driver gene mutations, predominantly EGFR (58.57 %), followed by KRAS and ALK. Patients with mutations who received either targeted or immune consolidation therapy demonstrated a significantly longer median PFS (42.97 months vs. 24.87 months, p = 0.014) and improved OS (not reached vs. 24.37 months, p = 0.006), compared to those without consolidation therapy. Targeted therapy in mutant patients resulted in an extended median PFS (42.87 months) compared to immune therapy (27.03 months, p = 0.029), with no significant difference in OS. Median PFS and OS were similar between mutant and wild -type patients receiving immune therapy (p = 0.380 and p = 0.928, respectively). Conclusion: This study underscores the efficacy of targeted consolidation therapy in enhancing PFS in LUAD patients with genetic mutations. It also shows that immune consolidation therapy provides similar survival benefits to mutant and wild -type patients. Future research should focus on optimizing these therapies for improved patient outcomes.

TI  - Patterns of Failure, Low-Volume Relapse, and Subsequent Ablative Management in Locally Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Treated With De fi nitive Chemoradiation and Consolidation Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION ONCOLOGY BIOLOGY PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: The objective of this study was to describe the patterns of failure, frequency of low-volume relapse (LVR), and candidacy for ablative therapy at time of disease progression (PD) after chemoradiation and consolidative immunotherapy (CRT + ICI) in patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer. Methods and Materials: We identi fi ed 229 consecutive patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer treated with CRT + ICI between October 2017 and December 2021 at a single institution. PD was classi fi ed as isolated locoregional failure (LRF), isolated distant failure (DF), or synchronous LRF + DF. Any LRF was subclassi fied as in - field failure, marginal failure, or out -of - fi eld failure. LVR was de fi ned as 3 or fewer sites of PD in any number of organs. Ablative candidates were defined as having 5 or fewer sites of PD radiographically amenable to high -dose radiation or surgery. Time-to-event data were calculated using cumulative incidence analysis and Kaplan -Meier methods. Multivariable Cox modeling was used to examine the correlations between characteristics of relapse and postprogression survival. Results: Of the 229 patients, 119 (52%) had PD. Of these 119 patients, 20 (21%) had isolated LRF, 28 (24%) had synchronous LRF + DF, and 71 (60%) had isolated DF. Of the 48 patients with any LRF, 28 (58%) had in - fi eld failure, 10 (21%) marginal failure, and 10 (21%) out -of - fi eld failure. The cumulative incidence of LRF and DF was 13% (95% CI, 9.2%-18%) and 32% (95% CI, 26%-38%) at 1 year and 19% (95% CI, 14%-24%) and 39% (95% CI, 33%-46%) at 2 years, respectively. Overall, 64 patients (54%) were considered to have LVR. At time of PD, 60 patients (50%) were eligible for ablative therapy. Patients with LVR had longer median survival versus with high -volume relapse (37.4 vs 15.2 months, P < .001). On multivariable analysis, LVR (hazard ratio, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.18-0.56; P < .001) was associated with improved postprogression survival. Conclusions: After CRT + ICI, approximately half of patients experience LVR at time of PD and are candidates for ablative therapies. Prospective trials are needed to validate the optimal treatment strategy for LVR. (c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - The Molecular and Microenvironmental Landscape of Glioblastomas: Implications for the Novel Treatment Choices
T2  - FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most frequent and aggressive primary central nervous system tumor. Surgery followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy with alkylating agents constitutes standard first-line treatment of GBM. Complete resection of the GBM tumors is generally not possible given its high invasive features. Although this combination therapy can prolong survival, the prognosis is still poor due to several factors including chemoresistance. In recent years, a comprehensive characterization of the GBM-associated molecular signature has been performed. This has allowed the possibility to introduce a more personalized therapeutic approach for GBM, in which novel targeted therapies, including those employing tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), could be employed. The GBM tumor microenvironment (TME) exerts a key role in GBM tumor progression, in particular by providing an immunosuppressive state with low numbers of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and other immune effector cell types that contributes to tumor proliferation and growth. The use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has been successfully introduced in numerous advanced cancers as well as promising results have been shown for the use of these antibodies in untreated brain metastases from melanoma and from non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Consequently, the use of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors has also been proposed in several clinical trials for the treatment of GBM. In the present review, we will outline the main GBM molecular and TME aspects providing also the grounds for novel targeted therapies and immunotherapies using ICIs for GBM.

TI  - Beyond PACIFIC: Real-World Outcomes of Adjuvant Durvalumab According to Treatment Received and PD-L1 Expression
T2  - CURRENT ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Adjuvant durvalumab after chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is the standard of care for unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A post hoc exploratory analysis of PACIFIC revealed no OS benefit in the PD-L1 < 1% subgroup. This retrospective analysis assesses the realworld impact of durvalumab on OS according to PD-L1 tumor proportion score (TPS). Patients with stage III, unresectable NSCLC treated by CRT, with available PD-L1 TPS, from 1 March 2018 to 31 December 2020, at BC Cancer, British Columbia, Canada were included. Patients were divided into two groups, CRT + durvalumab and CRT alone. OS and PFS were analyzed in the PD-L1 >= 1% and <1% subgroups. A total of 134 patients were included in the CRT + durvalumab group and 117, in the CRT alone group. Median OS was 35.9 months in the CRT + durvalumab group and 27.4 months in the CRT alone group [HR 0.59 (95% CI 0.42-0.83), p = 0.003]. Durvalumab improved OS in the PD-L1 >= 1% [HR 0.53 (95% CI 0.34-0.81), p = 0.003, n = 175], but not in the <1% subgroup [HR 0.79 (95% CI 0.44-1.42), p = 0.4, n = 76]. This retrospective study demonstrates a statistically significant improvement in OS associated with durvalumab after CRT in PD-L1 >= 1%, but not PD-L1 < 1% NSCLC. Variables not accounted for may have biased the survival analysis. A prospective study would bring more insight.

TI  - Early recurrence factors in patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy
T2  - THORACIC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The clinical characteristics and risk factors for cancer recurrence have not been well evaluated regarding early recurrence in patients with unresectable locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC) who receive concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT). The aim of this study was to determine the clinical characteristics and risk factors of patients with stage III unresectable LA-NSCLC treated with CRT who developed early recurrence. Methods We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of 46 patients diagnosed with stage III unresectable LA-NSCLC treated with CRT at our center between July 2012 and July 2021. A tumor proportion score (TPS) < 50% was defined as "low expression" and a TPS > 50% was defined as "high expression." Results A total of 17 (37.0%) patients had a confirmed recurrence within 1 year of treatment. More patients had a lower body mass index in the early recurrence group than in the later recurrence group (p = 0.038). A higher number of patients in the late recurrence group underwent surgery after CRT (p = 0.036). Patients with a higher TPS were more likely to experience late recurrence than early recurrence (p = 0.001), whereas more patients with stage N3 disease were in the early recurrence group (p = 0.011). Multivariate analysis identified lower TPS expression as an independent risk factor for early recurrence after CRT. Overall survival was prolonged in the late recurrence group (p < 0.001). Conclusions A lower TPS may be a predictor of early recurrence after CRT in patients with LA-NSCLC. These patients should be closely monitored for post-treatment recurrence.

TI  - Effectiveness of immunological agents in non-small cell lung cancer
T2  - CANCER REPORTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Background and aim Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) continues to claim millions of lives worldwide. Although its poor prognosis is largely attributed to the lack of adequate and precise detection technologies, cancer cells' suppression of the immune system adds on to the difficulty of identifying abnormal NSCLC tumors in their early stages. Therefore, cancer immunotherapy, which activates the immune system and helps it fight tumors, has recently become the most sought-after technique, especially in the advanced stages of NSCLC, where surgery or chemotherapy may or may not bring about the desired survival benefits in patients. Methods This review focuses on the various immunotherapeutic interventions and their efficacy in advanced NSCLC clinical trials. Monoclonal antibodies like anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agents and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies, cancer vaccines, oncolytic viruses and adoptive T cell therapy have been discussed in brief. Furthermore, the effects of gender, age, and race on the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors and suggest plausible future approaches in the realm of immuno-oncology. Results Immunotherapy is used alone or in combination either with other immunological agents or with chemotherapy. However, the efficacy of these strategies depends extensively on various demographic variables, as some patients respond perfectly well to immunotherapy, while others do not benefit at all or experience disease progression. By targeting a "hallmark" of cancer (immune evasion), immunotherapy has transformed NSCLC management, though several barriers prevent its complete effectiveness. Conclusions All these immunological strategies should be interpreted in the current setting of synergistic treatment, in which these agents can be combined with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and, or surgery following patient and tumor characteristics to proportionate the best-individualized treatment and achieve superior results. To better pursue this goal, further investigations on cost-effectiveness and sex-gender, race, and age differences in immunotherapy are needed.

TI  - Thorough survey and analysis of pulmonary lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma in Macau and multimodality treatment for advanced disease
T2  - LUNG CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Pulmonary lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma (LELC) is a rare type of non-small cell lung cancer. The clinical course and prognosis of advanced LELC are largely unknown. Few reports have discussed multimodality treatment for LELC.Materials and methods: This retrospective study identified records from 2007 to 2018 of pulmonary LELCs and other lung cancer subtypes from hospital information systems and collected demographic, treatment, and survival data.Results: In this cohort of 69 LELCs (median age: 55.4), more female, non-smokers, and fewer right upper lobe tumors (4.3%) were observed in the LELC subgroup compared with others. The median overall survival (OS) of LELCs was 40 months, superior to other subtypes (p < 0.05), except adenocarcinoma (p = 0.062). Patients with early stage disease and primary tumor resection tended to have better OS in univariate analysis, but surgery was the independent predictor in multivariate analysis (0.042). The median OS of 52 advanced LELCs was 22.7 months. Platinum-based chemotherapy and radiotherapy with curative purpose were independent predictors for OS of advanced LELCs (p = 0.004 and 0.003, respectively). For patients who received multimodality treatment in advanced setting, the median line of treatments was two. The overall response and disease-control rates were 61.8% and 80.6%, respectively. There were no differences in response or survival between patients receiving taxane-combined and non-taxane-combined chemotherapy. However, patients treated with radiotherapy in upfront settings had significantly favorable response and progression-free survival compared with those without. One case with PD-L1 positivity had pembrolizumab in the 4th line and achieved tumor shrinkage and stable disease for 12 months.Conclusion: Patients who underwent radical resection of primary tumors had better prognoses. Patients with advanced LELC could achieve satisfactory survival by receiving multimodality treatment, including platinum-based chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. Immune checkpoint inhibitors may be part of future therapies. A well-organized clinical trial should be performed to determine the optimal treatment regimen.

TI  - Strategies to Improve the Antitumor Effect of Immunotherapy for Hepatocellular Carcinoma
T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), one of the most fatal malignancies in the world, is usually diagnosed in advanced stages due to late symptom manifestation with very limited therapeutic options, which leads to ineffective intervention and dismal prognosis. For a decade, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have offered an overall survival (OS) benefit when used in a first-line (sorafenib and lenvatinib) and second-line setting (regorafenib and cabozantinib) in advanced HCC, while long-term response remains unsatisfactory due to the onset of primary or acquired resistance. Recently, immunotherapy has emerged as a promising therapy in the treatment of several solid tumors, such as melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer. Moreover, as the occurrence of HCC is associated with immune tolerance and immunosurveillance escape, there is a potent rationale for employing immunotherapy in HCC. However, immunotherapy monotherapy, mainly including immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) that target checkpoints programmed death-1 (PD-1), programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), and the cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4), has a relatively low response rate. Thus, the multi-ICIs or the combination of immunotherapy with other therapies, like antiangiogenic drugs and locoregional therapies, has become a novel strategy to treat HCC. Combining different ICIs may have a synergistical effect attributed to the complementary effects of the two immune checkpoint pathways (CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1 pathways). The incorporation of antiangiogenic drugs in ICIs can enhance antitumor immune responses via synergistically regulating the vasculature and the immune microenvironment of tumor. In addition, locoregional treatments can improve antitumor immunity by releasing the neoplasm antigens from killed tumor cells; in turn, this antitumor immune response can be intensified by immunotherapy. Therefore, the combination of locoregional treatments and immunotherapy may achieve greater efficacy through further synergistic effects for advanced HCC. This review aims to summarize the currently reported results and ongoing trials of the ICIs-based combination therapies for HCC to explore the rational combination strategies and further improve the survival of patients with HCC.

TI  - Feasibility study of DCs/CIKs combined with thoracic radiotherapy for patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer
T2  - RADIATION ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The combination of dendritic cells (DCs) and cytokine-induced killer cells (CIKs) can induce the anti-tumor immune response and radiotherapy may promote the activity. We aimed to explore the feasibility of DCs/CIKs combined with thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) for patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Method: In this study, patients with unresectable stage III/IV NSCLC and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) of 0-2 and previously receiving two or more cycles of platinum-based doublet chemotherapy without disease progression received TRT plus DCs/CIKs or TRT alone until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was median progression-free survival (mPFS). In treatment group, patients received four-cycle autologous DCs/CIKs infusion starting from the 6th fraction of irradiation.Results: From Jan 13, 2012 to June 30, 2014, 82 patients were enrolled, with 21 patients in treatment group and 61 in control group. The mPFS in treatment group was longer than that in control group (330 days vs 233 days, hazard ratio 0.51, 95 % CI 0.27-1.0, P < 0.05), and the objective response rate (ORR) of treatment group (47.6 %) was significantly higher that of control group (24.6 %, P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in disease control rate (DCR) and median overall survival (mOS) between two groups (P > 0.05). The side effects in treatment group were mild and there was no treatment-related deaths.Conclusion: The combination of DCs/CIKs with TRT could be a feasible regimen in treating locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC patients. Further investigation of the regimen is warranted.

TI  - Harnessing the power of traditional Chinese medicine monomers and compound prescriptions to boost cancer immunotherapy
T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - At present, cancer is the largest culprit that endangers human health. The current treatment options for cancer mainly include surgical resection, adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy, but their therapeutic effects and long-term prognosis are unsatisfactory. Immunotherapy is an emerging therapy that has completely transformed the therapeutic landscape of advanced cancers, and has tried to occupy a place in the neoadjuvant therapy of resectable tumors. However, not all patients respond to immunotherapy due to the immunological and molecular features of the tumors. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) provides a new perspective for cancer treatment and is considered to have the potential as promising anti-tumor drugs considering its immunoregulatory properties. This review concludes commonly used TCM monomers and compounds from the perspective of immune regulatory pathways, aiming to clearly introduce the basic mechanisms of TCM in boosting cancer immunotherapy and mechanisms of several common TCM. In addition, we also summarized closed and ongoing trials and presented prospects for future development. Due to the significant role of immunotherapy in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), TCM combined with immunotherapy should be emphasized in NSCLC.

TI  - Alectinib activity in chemotherapy-refractory metastatic <i>RET</i>-rearranged non-small cell lung carcinomas: A case series
T2  - LUNG CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: to report outcomes of four cases of chemo-refractory RET-rearranged non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs) treated with alectinib in a single center.Materials and methods: we retrospectively assessed and reported the activity and tolerability of alectinib 600 mg twice daily in advanced and chemo-refractory RET-rearranged NSCLC patients treated in a Brazilian institution. Identification of RET rearrangements was performed using the FoundationOne (R) next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform.Results: The four patients herein reported were white, female and non-smokers, ranging between 59-66 years of age. All patients had been previously treated with chemotherapy and were TKI naive; three of them presented disease progression to nivolumab as well. Molecular tumor profiling showed a KIF5B-RET fusion in three patients and a CCDC6-RET in the fourth. One patient exhibited disease progression and clinical deterioration two months after treatment initiation. Disease control was documented in two patients with PFS ranging from 4 to 5 months (one partial metabolic response and one stable disease). In one of the cases, which developed oligoprogression on alectinib, radiation therapy plus post-progression alectinib were able to provide additional disease control for 9 more months. No grade 3/4 adverse events, dose reductions or discontinuation due to toxicity were documented.Conclusion: Although this is a small single center evaluation, alectinib was well tolerated and demonstrated clinical activity against advanced RET-rearranged NSCLCs, suggesting its potential role in this specific subset of malignancies. Clinical trials addressing its efficacy and the optimal dosing schedule in the present context are underway, and results are eagerly awaited.

TI  - Meta-analysis of chemotherapy and dendritic cells with cytokine-induced killer cells in the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of the most fatal cancers, which leads to large number of people dead. Followed by surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, chemotherapy combined dendritic cells with cytokine-induced killer cells (DC-CIK) immunotherapy has been applied in NSCLC for some time, but little consistent beneficial results are provided. So, it is essential to weigh the pros and cons of the new therapeutic method. Methods: We searched the randomized controlled trials of NSCLC mainly by PubMed database. Terms combination of "cytokine-induced killer cells", "tumor" and "cancer" were used. After evaluating the heterogeneity of selected studies, then we performed the meta-analysis. Pooled risk ratios (RRs) were estimated and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a fixed-effect model. Sensitivity analysis was also performed. Results: Six eligible trials were enrolled. Efficiency and safety of chemotherapy followed by DC-CIK immunotherapy (experimental group) and chemotherapy alone (control group) were compared. 1-year overall survival (OS) (P=0.02) and progression free survival (PFS) (P=0.005) in the experimental group were significantly increased compared with the control. Disease control rate (DCR) (P=0.006) rose significantly in experimental group. However, no significant differences between the two groups were observed in 2-year OS (P=0.21), 2-year PFS (P=0.10), overall response rate (ORR) (P=0.76) and partial response (PR) (P=0.22). Temporary fever, anemia, leukopenia and nausea were the four major adverse events (AEs) treated by chemotherapy. The incidence of anemia, leukopenia and nausea in the experimental group was obviously lower than the control group. Temporary fever rate was higher in experimental group than that in the control, but could be alleviated by taking sufficient rest. Conclusions: Chemotherapy combined with DC-CIK immunotherapy showed superiority in DCR, 1-year OS and PFS, and no more AEs appeared, however, there was no significant improvement in ORR, PR, 2-year OS and PFS. As a whole, the combination therapy is safer but modest in efficacy for advanced NSCLC patients.

T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a special type of lung cancer that belongs to highly aggressive neuroendocrine tumors. At present, radiotherapy and chemotherapy remain the mainstay of treatment for SCLC. Progress in targeted therapies for SCLC with driver mutations has been slow, and these therapies are still under investigation in preclinical or early-phase clinical trials, and research on antiangiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitors (e.g., anlotinib) has achieved some success. Immunotherapy is becoming an important treatment strategy for SCLC after radiotherapy and chemotherapy. In this article we review the recent advances in immunotherapy for SCLC.

TI  - Rationale and Design for a Multicenter, Phase II Study of Durvalumab Plus Concurrent Radiation Therapy in Locally Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: The DOLPHIN Study (WJOG11619L)
T2  - CANCER MANAGEMENT AND RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Durvalumab (anti-programmed cell death ligand-1) administration after concurrent chemoradiotherapy (cCRT) has improved the survival of patients with unresectable, locally advanced (LA) stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Some patients are unable to complete cCRT and cannot receive immunotherapy due to poor performance status based on adverse events after cCRT. Immunotherapy plays an important role in anti-programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1)-positive advanced NSCLC and is replacing chemotherapy. In addition, radiotherapy and immunotherapy have been reported to have a synergistic effect. This Phase II, multicenter study (DOLPHIN, WJOG11619L, JapicCTI-194840) is designed to assess the efficacy and safety of durvalumab plus concurrent curative radiation therapy for PD-L1-positive unresectable LA-NSCLC without chemotherapy. Unresectable LA stage III NSCLC patients aged 20 years or older with a World Health Organization/Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0 or 1 and PD-L1 positivity are enrolled. The patients will receive curative radiation therapy (60 Gy) plus durvalumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks (q2w) for up to 12 months until there is evidence of disease progression (PD) or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint is the 12-month progression-free survival rate as assessed by an independent central review. The secondary endpoints are progression-free survival, overall survival, objective response rate, treatment completion rate, and safety. Recruitment began in September 2019.

TI  - Giant Circulating Cancer-Associated Macrophage-Like Cells Are Associated With Disease Recurrence and Survival in NoneSmall-Cell Lung Cancer Treated With Chemoradiation and Atezolizumab
T2  - CLINICAL LUNG CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Development of distant metastatic disease is common in patients with locally advanced nonesmall-cell lung cancer, leading to high rates of cancer-related mortality. Monitoring for early signs of disease recurrence from peripheral blood markers is an attractive avenue toward personalizing cancer care. We identified a novel macrophage-like circulating cell whose size appears to associate with poorer survival and the development of metastatic disease shortly after completion of definitive treatment.Background: Cancer-associated macrophage-like cells (CAMLs) are a potential peripheral blood biomarker for disease progression. This study used data from a phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate prognostic utility of CAMLs for locally advanced nonesmall-cell lung cancer treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT) and atezolizumab (DETERRED; ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02525757). Patients and Methods: Sample collection occurred at baseline (T0), during CRT (T1), at end of CRT (T2), and at first follow-up (T3). CAMLs were captured and quantified by the CellSieve system using multiplex immunostaining. Giant CAMLs were defined as characteristic CAMLs >= 50 mu m. Kaplan-Meier methodology estimated progression-free survival, distant failure-free survival, relapse-free survival, and overall survival at 30 months. Results: Thirty-nine patients were evaluated between December 2015 and March 2018. Median follow-up was 27 months. Most disease was stage III (85%) and comprised squamous-cell carcinoma (38%) or adenocarcinoma (59%). In total, 267 blood samples were analyzed. Giant CAMLs were identified in 57%, 60%, 64%, and 63% of patients at T0, T1, T2, and T3, respectively. Patients with giant CAMLs at T3, occurring at a median of 30 days after completion of CRT, had significantly worse distant failure-free survival (hazard ratio [HR] 4.9, P = .015), progression-free survival (HR 2.5, P = .025), recurrence-free survival (HR 2.4, P = .036), and overall survival (HR 3.5, P = .034) compared to patients with small or no CAMLs. Conclusions: Presence of giant CAMLs after CRT completion was associated with development of metastatic disease and poorer survival despite the use of maintenance immunotherapy. Monitoring CAMLs may help risk-stratify patients for adaptive treatment strategies.

TI  - Mechanisms of drugs-resistance in small cell lung cancer: DNA-related, RNA-related, apoptosis-related, drug accumulation and metabolism procedure
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL LUNG CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), the highest malignant cancer amongst different types of lung cancer, has the feature of lower differentiation, rapid growth, and poor survival rate. Despite the dramatically initial sensitivity of SCLC to various types of treatment methods, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy and immunotherapy, the emergence of drugs-resistance is still a grandly clinical challenge. Therefore, in order to improve the prognosis and develop new therapeutic approaches, having a better understanding of the complex mechanisms of resistance in SCLC is of great clinical significance. This review summarized recent advances in understanding of multiple mechanisms which are involved in the resistance during SCLC treatment, including DNA-related process, RNA-related process, apoptosis-related mechanism, and the process of drug accumulation and metabolism.

TI  - Treatment Intensification in Locally Advanced/Unresectable NSCLC Through Combined Modality Treatment and Precision Dose Escalation
T2  - SEMINARS IN RADIATION ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The best survival for patients with unresectable, locally advanced NSCLC is currently achieved through concurrent chemoradiation followed by durvalumab for a year. Despite the best standard of care treatment, the majority of patients still develop disease recurrence, which could be distant and/or local. Trials continue to try and improve outcomes for patients with unresectable NSCLC, typically through treatment intensification, with the addition of more systemic agents, or more radiation dose to the tumor. Although RTOG 0617 showed that uniform dose escalation across an unselected population of patients undergoing chemoradiation is not beneficial, efforts continue to select patients and tumor subsets that are likely to benefit from dose escalation. This review describes some of the ongoing therapeutic trials in unresectable NSCLC, with an emphasis on quantitative imaging and precision radiation dose escalation.

A1  - NVALT Immunotherapy Register
TI  - Effects of checkpoint inhibitors in advanced non-small cell lung cancer at population level from the National Immunotherapy Registry
T2  - LUNG CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Phase III studies of checkpoint inhibitors changed the therapeutic landscape for lung cancer. In 2015 the Dutch Society of Chest Physicians (NVALT) introduced a national immunotherapy registry for patients with lung cancer; quality standards for hospitals were implemented. At population level we studied clinical benefit in daily practice and in patients who are underrepresented in phase III trials.Materials and Methods: From the initial introduction of checkpoint inhibitors in the Netherlands patients were centrally registered. Educational programs and quality control were provided under supervision of NVALT. The largest immunotherapy providing hospitals were compared to hospitals who provided less checkpoint inhibitors as marker of experience. Patients characteristics, treatment and side effects, response rate and survival were studied.Results: A total of 2676 patients were registered, 2302 with follow up data were evaluated. Between October 2015 and December 2017 a gradual increase from 12 to 30 qualified hospitals showed no major toxicity differences. Toxicity led to a hospital admission rate of 9.1 with an average duration of 10.4 days.Overall tumor response was 21.8 % and median overall survival 12.6 months. Overall survival was not significantly different for patients aged >= 75 years, those having brain metastases or selected auto-immune diseases before start checkpoint inhibitors compared to younger patients or those without, respectively. Survival outcomes were worse in patients with PS 2+, non-smokers, and patients who received any palliative radiotherapy (HR 2.1, 95 % CI 1.7-2.7; 1.3, 95 % CI 1.0-1.6 and 1.2, 95 % CI 1.1-1.4, respectively).Conclusions: Changes in the therapeutic landscape did not lead to major differences in quality of care between hospitals. Elderly patients, those with brain metastases or selected auto-immune disease underrepresented in clinical trials did not do worse on checkpoint inhibitors, except for those with PS 2+.

TI  - Impact of Intercurrent Introduction of Steroids on Clinical Outcomes in Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Patients under Immune-Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICI)
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple SummaryRecently, the introduction of immunotherapy radically changed the therapeutic algorithm of non-small-cell lung cancer as an upfront or secondary strategy. Unfortunately, the small amount of patient benefits from immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) and the prognostic role of concomitant treatments are a burning open issue. The use of steroids was associated with poor outcomes during ICI. We investigated the impact of intercurrent steroids, according to clinical indication, which is actually unclear. Interestingly, the use of intercurrent steroids given for cancer-unrelated symptoms has no survival impact on our study cohort.Background: Baseline steroids before ICI have been associated with poor outcomes, particularly when introduced due to cancer symptoms. Methods: Retrospective analysis of advanced NSCLC patients treated with ICI. We collected the use of intercurrent steroids (>= 10 mg of prednisone-equivalent) within the first eight weeks of ICI. We correlated steroid use with patient outcomes according to the indications. Results: 413 patients received ICI, 299 were steroids-naive at baseline. A total of 49 patients received intercurrent steroids (16%), of whom 38 for cancer-related symptoms and 11 for other indications, such as immune-related events. Overall, median (m) progression-free survival (PFS) was 1.9 months (mo.) [95% CI, 1.8-2.4] and overall survival (OS) 10 mo. [95% CI, 8.1-12.9]. Intercurrent steroids under ICI correlated with a shorter PFS/OS (1.3 and 2.3 mo. respectively, both p < 0.0001). Intercurrent steroids for cancer-related symptoms correlated with poorest mPFS [1.1 mo.; 95% CI, 0.9-1.5] and mOS [1.9 mo.; 95%CI, 1.5-2.4; p < 0.0001)]. No mOS and mPFS differences were found between cancer-unrelated-steroid group and no-steroid group. Steroid use for cancer-related symptoms was an independent prognostic factor for poor PFS [HR 2.64; 95% CI, 1.2-5.6] and OS [HR 4.53; 95% CI, 1.8-11.1], both p < 0.0001. Conclusion: Intercurrent steroids during ICI had no detrimental prognostic impact if the indication was unrelated to cancer symptoms.

TI  - A review of glioblastoma immunotherapy
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEURO-ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction Glioblastoma is a very aggressive cancer with dismal prognosis despite standard of care including surgical resection, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. There is interest in applying immunotherapy to glioblastoma as this modality has demonstrated remarkable improvements in the management of several solid tumors including melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, and non-small cell lung cancer. This review aims to provide an overview of the current state of glioblastoma immunotherapy. Methods Literature search was performed on PubMed between 1961 and 2020. Results Initial clinical trials of checkpoint inhibitors and vaccine therapy for glioblastoma have largely been disappointing for both primary and recurrent glioblastoma. This failure has been attributed to glioblastoma's highly immunosuppressive environment and multiple mechanisms of therapy resistance including high tumor heterogeneity, low mutational burden, systemic immunosuppression, and local immune dysfunction. Conclusions Current clinical trials are exploring combination therapy and novel treatment strategies beyond immune checkpoint therapies and vaccine therapy such as CAR T cells. There is also an effort to establish synergy between immunotherapy and current standard of care. Furthermore, recent advances in personalized neoantigen vaccines suggest a shift towards personalized, patient-specific GBM treatment.

TI  - Neutrophil-Lymphocyte Ratio Is a Prognostic Marker in Patients with Locally Advanced (Stage IIIA and IIIB) Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Treated with Combined Modality Therapy
T2  - ONCOLOGIST
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a measure of systemic inflammation that appears prognostic in localized and advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Increased systemic inflammation portends a poorer prognosis in cancer patients. We hypothesized that low NLR at diagnosis is associated with improved overall survival (OS) in locally advanced NSCLC (LANSCLC) patients.Patients and Methods. Records from 276 patients with stage IIIA and IIIB NSCLC treated with definitive chemoradiation with or without surgery between 2000 and 2010 with adequate data were retrospectively reviewed. Baseline demographic data and pretreatment peripheral blood absolute neutrophil and lymphocyte counts were collected. Patients were grouped into quartiles based on NLR. OS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The log-rank test was used to compare mortality between groups. A linear test-for-trend was used for the NLR quartile groups. The Cox proportional hazards model was used for multivariable analysis.Results. The NLR was prognostic for OS (p < .0001). Median survival in months (95% confidence interval) for the first, second, third, and fourth quartile groups of the population distribution of NLR were 27 (19-36), 28 (22-34), 22 (12-31), and 10 (8-12), respectively. NLR remained prognostic for OS after adjusting for race, sex, stage, performance status, and chemoradiotherapy approach (p=.004).Conclusion. To our knowledge, our series is the largest to demonstrate that baseline NLR is a significant prognostic indicator in LANSCLC patients who received definitive chemoradiation with or without surgery. As an indicator of inflammatory response, it should be explored as a potential predictive marker in the context of immunotherapy and radiation therapy.

AB  - PURPOSEStandard therapy for locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC) is concurrent chemoradiotherapy followed by adjuvant durvalumab. For biomarker-selected patients with LA-NSCLC, we hypothesized that sequential pembrolizumab and risk-adapted radiotherapy, without chemotherapy, would be well-tolerated and effective.METHODSPatients with stage III NSCLC or unresectable stage II NSCLC and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1 were eligible for this trial. Patients with a PD-L1 tumor proportion score (TPS) of >= 50% received three cycles of induction pembrolizumab (200 mg, once every 21 days), followed by a 20-fraction course of risk-adapted thoracic radiotherapy (55 Gy delivered to tumors or lymph nodes with metabolic volume exceeding 20 cc, 48 Gy delivered to smaller lesions), followed by consolidation pembrolizumab to complete a 1-year treatment course. The primary study end point was 1-year progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary end points included response rates after induction pembrolizumab, overall survival (OS), and adverse events.RESULTSTwenty-five patients with a PD-L1 TPS of >= 50% were enrolled. The median age was 71, most patients (88%) had stage IIIA or IIIB disease, and the median PD-L1 TPS was 75%. Two patients developed disease progression during induction pembrolizumab, and two patients discontinued pembrolizumab after one infusion because of immune-related adverse events. Using RECIST criteria, 12 patients (48%) exhibited a partial or complete response after induction pembrolizumab. Twenty-four patients (96%) received definitive thoracic radiotherapy. The 1-year PFS rate is 76%, satisfying our efficacy objective. One- and 2-year OS rates are 92% and 76%, respectively. The most common grade 3 adverse events were colitis (n = 2, 8%) and esophagitis (n = 2, 8%), and no higher-grade treatment-related adverse events have occurred.CONCLUSIONPembrolizumab and risk-adapted radiotherapy, without chemotherapy, are a promising treatment approach for patients with LA-NSCLC with a PD-L1 TPS of >= 50%.Prospective study of chemo-free treatment with pembro + RT for biomarker-selected LA-NSCLC patients.

TI  - Evaluation of the efficacy and surgical-related safety of neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy in advanced resectable none small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe emergence of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has brought about a paradigm shift in the treatment landscape of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Despite the promising long-term survival outcomes and optimization of pathological complete response (cPR) demonstrated by various studies such as Impower010 and Checkmate-816, the effectiveness of neoadjuvant immunotherapy in advanced resectable NSCLC remains a subject of debate. Although previous research has explored the connection between the efficacy of neoadjuvant therapy and surgical-related safety, limited studies have specifically investigated the surgical-related safety of neoadjuvant immunotherapy. Therefore, our study aims to assess the efficacy and surgical-related safety of neoadjuvant immunotherapy in advanced resectable non-small cell lung cancer.MethodWe conducted a retrospective study on a cohort of 93 patients with stage IIIA-IIIC NSCLC who underwent neoadjuvant therapy and surgical resection. Among them, 53 patients received neoadjuvant immunotherapy, 18 patients underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy while the remaining 22 underwent neoadjuvant targeted therapy. The patients were separated into further groups according to their pathological type. Data analyses were performed using Mann-Whitney U test, chi-square test.ResultsAll patients were categorized into six distinct groups. Notably, the neoadjuvant immunotherapy squamous carcinoma group exhibited a favorable edge over the neoadjuvant targeted squamous carcinoma group concerning the duration of drainage tube indwelling and the extent of lymph node dissection. Furthermore, the neoadjuvant immunotherapy adenocarcinoma group outperformed neoadjuvant targeted therapy adenocarcinoma counterpart in terms of achieving complete pathological response (cPR). Simultaneously, the neoadjuvant immunotherapy adenocarcinoma group surpassed the neoadjuvant chemotherapy adenocarcinoma group in the incidence of hydrothorax. Nevertheless, no statistically significant disparities were noted between the neoadjuvant immunotherapy squamous carcinoma group and the neoadjuvant chemotherapy carcinoma group.ConclusionRegarding surgical outcomes, neoadjuvant immunotherapy conferred notable advantages compared to conventional neoadjuvant chemotherapy and neoadjuvant targeted therapy for patients diagnosed with adenocarcinoma. In the case of squamous carcinoma, neoadjuvant immunotherapy exhibited superiority over neoadjuvant targeted therapy, although additional evidence is required to conclusively establish its precedence over neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

TI  - Consolidation Systemic Therapy in Locally Advanced, Inoperable Nonsmall Cell Lung Cancer-How to Identify Patients Which Can Benefit from It?
T2  - CURRENT ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Consolidation systemic therapy (ST) given after concurrent radiotherapy (RT) and ST (RT-ST) is frequently practiced in locally advanced inoperable nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Little is known, however, about the fate of patients achieving different responses after concurrent phases of the treatment. Methods: we searched the English-language literature to identify full-length articles on phase II and Phase III clinical studies employing consolidation ST after initial concurrent RT-ST. We sought information about response evaluation after the concurrent phase and the outcome of these patient subgroups, the patterns of failure per response achieved after the concurrent phase as well as the outcome of these subgroups after the consolidation phase. Results: Eighty-seven articles have been initially identified, of which 20 studies were excluded for various reasons, leaving, therefore, a total of 67 studies for our analysis. Response evaluation after the concurrent phase was performed in 36 (54%) studies but in only 14 (21%) response data were provided, while in 34 (51%) studies patients underwent a consolidation phase regardless of the response. No study provided any outcome (survivals, patterns of failure) as per response achieved after the concurrent phase. Conclusions: Information regarding the outcome of subgroups of patients achieving different responses after the concurrent phase and before the administration of the consolidation phase is still lacking. This may negatively affect the decision-making process as it remains unknown which patients may preferentially benefit from the consolidation of ST.

TI  - Surgical Management of Stage IIIA Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - According to the eighth edition of the tumor-node-metastasis classification, stage III non-small cell lung cancer is subdivided into stages IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC. They represent a heterogeneous group of bronchogenic carcinomas with locoregional involvement by extension of the primary tumor and/or ipsilateral or contralateral lymph node involvement. Surgical indications have not been definitely established but, in general, long-term survival is only obtained in those patients in whom a complete resection is obtained. This mini-review mainly focusses on stage IIIA disease comprising patients with locoregionally advanced lung cancers. Different subcategories of N2 involvement exist, which range from unexpected N2 disease after thorough preoperative staging or "surprise" N2, to bulky N2 involvement, mostly treated by chemoradiation, and finally, the intermediate category of potentially resectable N2 disease treated with a combined modality regimen. After induction therapy for preoperative N2 involvement, best surgical results are obtained with proven mediastinal downstaging when a lobectomy is feasible to obtain a microscopic complete resection. However, no definite, universally accepted guidelines exist. A relatively new entity is salvage surgery applied for recurrent disease after full-dose chemoradiation when no other therapeutic options exist. Equally, only a small subset of patients with T4N0-1 disease qualify for surgical resection after thorough discussion within a multidisciplinary tumor board on the condition that a complete resection is feasible. Targeted therapies and immunotherapy have recently become part of our therapeutic armamentarium, and it might be expected that they will be incorporated in current regimens after careful evaluation in randomized clinical trials.

TI  - Hypofraction Radiotherapy Followed by Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors for Locally Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Phase I/II Clinical Trial
T2  - International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics
M3  - Journal Paper
AB  - Purpose/Objective(s)To explore the safety and primary efficacy of hypofraction radiotherapy followed by immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) for stage III locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients.Materials/MethodsWe anticipated to enrolled 36 patients with stage III locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer, among which 18 patients were supposed to receive high-dose hypofraction radiotherapy (60-68Gy/15-17f) with ICI and another 18 patients for low-dose hypofraction radiotherapy (48Gy/12f) with ICI. The technique of esophagus-sparing simultaneous integrated boost was utilized. Chemotherapy could be given before or concurrent with hypofraction radiotherapy. The primary endpoints were the rate of radiation-induced pneumonitis (Grade III or more), esophagitis and myelosuppression. The second endpoints were 1-year local-regional control rate, 1-year progression-free survival rate, 1-year overall survival rate.ResultsFrom June 1<sup>st</sup>, 2021 to December 31th 2021, we totally enrolled 13 male patients (51-82 years old) and at present reported the primary outcome of safety and efficacy. All of these 13 patients were squamous cell carcinoma, among which there were 4 patients with stage IIIA, 6 patients with stage IIIB and 3 patients with IIIC. 11 patients received 60Gy/15f, 1 patient received 64Gy/16f and 1 patient received 68Gy/17f. 7 patients received inductive chemotherapy before radiotherapy and 8 patients received concurrent chemotherapy. 6 patients are currently within ICI maintenance (Durvalumab for 3 patients and Tislelizumab for 2 patients). After hypofraction radiotherapy, 4 patients were evaluated as partial response and the remaining 9 patients were evaluated as complete response (ORR=100%). No patients developed Grade III or more radiation-induced pneumonitis. 1 and 3 patients developed Grade I and Grade II esophagitis respectively. 2 patients developed myelosuppression (1 for Grade II and 1 for Grade IV, both patients received concurrent chemotherapy).ConclusionWithin short-term follow-up, hypofraction radiotherapy followed by immune checkpoint inhibitors is safe and efficacious.

AB  - During the last 30 years the developments in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) have been extremely scarce. Concurrent chemo-radiation associated with prophylactic cranial irradiation in case of complete clinical remission is standard in limited disease. In extensive disease, platinum/etoposide and topotecan remain the standard systemic approaches in the first- and second-line setting, respectively. The only notable improvement was communicated in the IMpower133 trial, by the addition of atezolizumab to the platinum/etoposide chemotherapy backbone. Against this background, the current article aims to review the most important abstracts presented at ASCO 2019 along with their potential impact for current clinical practice.

T2  - THORACIC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Bone metastasis (BoM) is common in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and considered as one of the negative prognostic factors. However, the impact of BoM on clinical outcomes of patients with advanced NSCLC treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) remains unclear. Methods A total of 103 patients treated with ICI monotherapy and 101 patients treated with ICIs combined with chemotherapy or antiangiogenesis therapy were retrospectively analyzed. The differences in progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and objective response rate (ORR) between BoM+ and BoM- were investigated. Results Of those 101 patients who received combination therapy, no significant difference between BoM- and BoM+ in terms of both median PFS and median OS (median PFS, 10.1 vs. 12.1 months,P= 0.6; median OS, NR vs. 24.6 months,P= 0.713) was determined. In contrast, of the 103 patients who received ICI monotherapy, BoM+ patients had an inferior PFS (4.2 vs. 6.7 months,P= 0.0484) and OS (12.5 vs. 23.9 months,P= 0.0036) compared with BoM- patients. The univariate and multivariate analysis in the ICI monotherapy group also identified BoM as an independent factor attenuating the efficacy of ICI monotherapy. Of all BoM+ patients who received ICI monotherapy, neither palliative radiotherapy nor bisphosphonate drugs improved OS (palliative radiotherapy: 12.5 vs. 16.7 months,P= 0.487; bisphosphonate drugs: 12.5 vs. 9.7 months,P= 0.568). Conclusions BoM attenuated the efficacy of ICI monotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC. Of BoM+ patients who received ICI monotherapy, neither palliative radiotherapy nor bisphosphonate drugs improved OS. Other therapeutic strategies are needed for patients with BoM.

TI  - Prophylactic cranial irradiation in SCLC
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL LUNG CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) has well established place in therapy for patients with limited-disease small cell lung cancer who responded to treatment. The data from randomized trials document that PCI reduces brain metastases rate from approximately 60% to 30%, and increases 3-year overall survival by approximately 5%. Currently, the dose of 25 Gy in 10 fractions is considered as standard. In attempt to reduce neuropsychological sequelae attributable to PCI hippocampal sparing techniques are employed. The existing studies suggest the benefit of hippocampal sparing in limiting memory and higher neurocognitive function losses, but with a risk of failures in the spared region. Ongoing studies will further validate the role of hippocampal sparing, both in terms of toxicity reduction and metastases prevention. PCI for patients who have undergone resection for stage I small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is not recommended, PCI may be, however, associated with a favourable outcome in SCLC patients who have undergone complete surgery in stages II?III. The role of PCI in extensive-disease (ED) SCLC has been evolving. Most recent evidence indicate that PCI is controversial in ED patients with response to initial chemotherapy and absence of brain metastases confirmed by contrast-enhanced MRI. The patients who do not receive PCI, must, however, receive periodic MRI examination during follow-up, i.e., remain under active surveillance with access to radiotherapy at brain relapse. The assessment of safety and effectiveness of hippocampalsparing PCI, with or without drug neuroprotection in consideration of diverse combinations of radiotherapy, chemotherapy and immunotherapy create a background for future directions of research.

AB  - Background Small cell lung cancers (SCLC) are aggressive tumors, which are typically diagnosed at a late stage with a limited prognosis. Advances in the diagnosis and therapy of SCLC over the past decades have led to a slight improvement in prognosis and survival. Results In limited stage (LS) SCLC, the treatment of choice is combined chemoradiation, either hyper- or conventionally fractionated, followed by a prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in case of response after primary treatment. The chemotherapy combination of choice is a platinum-containing doublet with etoposide, over at least 4 cycles. In the metastatic setting, the role of consolidation mediastinal radiotherapy (RT) and PCI is controversial. The integration of immunotherapy in combination with chemoradiation is currently under investigation in several studies. Concepts for avoiding long-term neurocognitive side effects using whole-brain radiation with hippocampal sparring or radiosurgery in SCLC are also being investigated in prospective studies. Conclusion Radiotherapy plays an important role in the treatment of small cell lung cancer.

AB  - Brain metastases in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients are more often detected due to imaging modalities improvements but also emerge because of improved treatments of the primary tumor which lead to a longer survival. In this context, development of leptomeningeal metastases (LM) is a devastating complication and its prognosis remains poor despite advances in systemic and local approaches. Histology characterization of NSCLC and molecular expression influence LM management. For those with "oncogene addiction," new generation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) were developed to strongly penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) with the aim to prevent central nervous system cancer dissemination, eventually impacting on LM appearance and its subsequent management. Systemic chemotherapy, often combined with intrathecal chemotherapy (when possible), was one of common indications for lung cancer patients affected by LM, without driver mutations and a good performance status but currently, with the advent of innovative systemic approaches treatment solutions in this subgroup of patients are rapidly evolving. Whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) is the conventional treatment for patients with brain metastases. Furthermore, modern radiation techniques, as stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT), improve outcomes in those cases with a limited number of lesions. However, LM represent a minority of CNS metastases and few literature data are available to drive the radiotherapy approach. Considering all relevant progress made in this setting, after a literature review, the aim of this paper is to discuss about recent developments and therapeutic options in LM management of non-oncogene addicted NSCLC.

TI  - Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in Esophageal Cancers: Are We Finally Finding the Right Path in the Mist?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - Esophageal cancer remains a challenging disease due to limited treatment options and poor prognosis. In recent years, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have been proven to be safe and effective in the treatment of highly lethal malignancies, such as non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma. Recent clinical trials also showed promising activity in immune checkpoint inhibitors in pretreated advanced esophageal carcinoma and a potentially significant impact on the outcome of selected patients, independently of histology. Combination studies evaluating immunotherapy and chemotherapy and, in localized disease, radiotherapy are in progress and will hopefully confirm their promises in the near future. However, reliable predictive biomarkers are still lacking. Indeed, at present, the role of programmed cell death ligand 1 expression and other factors (such as microsatellite instability and tumor mutational burden) as predictive biomarkers of benefit to immune checkpoint inhibitors is still controversial. Our aim was to explore the rationale of ICIs in esophageal cancer, review the results already available in multiple settings, and investigate future perspectives with single-agent and combination strategies.

TI  - Clinical practice guideline for the management of small cell lung cancer: extensive disease
T2  - GACETA MEXICANA DE ONCOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) represents 13-15% of all primary lung neoplasms and is characterized by its rapid growth rate and the rapid development of distant metastases. Objectives: To guide and standardize the treatment of extensive disease small cell lung cancer in Mexico based on national and international clinical evidence. Material and methods: This document was developed as a collaboration between the National Cancer Institute and the Mexican Society of Oncology in compliance with international standards. An interdisciplinary group was formed, including medical oncologists, oncological surgeons, thoracic surgeons, radiation oncologists, and methodologists with experience in systematic reviews of the literature and clinical practice guidelines. Results: A consensus was reached, both by the Delphi method and in remote meetings, of extensive disease recommendations resulting from work questions. The scientific evidence that answers each of these clinical questions was identified and critically evaluated, before being incorporated into the body of evidence of the Guide. Conclusions: This Clinical Practice Guide provides clinical recommendations for the management of extensive disease of SCLC to contribute to the decision-making process of the clinicians involved with its management in our country, hoping that this will contribute to improving the quality of clinical care in these patients.

TI  - Efficacy and safety analysis of immune checkpoint inhibitor rechallenge therapy in locally advanced and advanced non-small cell lung cancer: a retrospective study
T2  - JOURNAL OF THORACIC DISEASE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have dramatically changed the first-line treatment pattern of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) without driver gene alterations. However, the optimal choice for second-line treatment after initial treatment with ICIs is unclear. This study aimed to clarify the efficacy and safety of ICI rechallenge therapy in locally advanced and advanced NSCLC. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the histories of 224 patients with locally advanced or advanced NSCLC treated with programmed death-1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors alone or in combination with chemotherapy and/or antiangiogenic therapy in first-line treatment. Progression-free survival 2 (PFS2) was the time from the first defined progress disease (PD) to the second disease progression or death. Efficacy evaluation was performed directly in accordance with RECIST v1.1 criteria. Adverse events (AEs) were graded following the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v5.0. Survival data were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method or Cox survival regression model and compared using the log-rank test in overall cohort and other subgroups. Results: There were no significant differences in objective response rate (ORR) and median PFS2 (mPFS2) between the ICI rechallenge group and non-rechallenge group (ORR: 10.3% vs. 15.3%, P=0.308; mPFS2: 5.33 vs. 4.40 months, P=0.715). And the ICI rechallenge group showed no new safety signals compared with non-rechallenge group. In ICI rechallenge group, patients resistant to first-line immunotherapy had a lower ORR and shorter PFS2 compared with those who responded to initial ICIs treatment (ORR: 7.0% vs. 17.6%, P=0.038; mPFS2: 3.68 vs. 5.91 months, P=0.014). No significant difference in mPFS2 was observed among different second-line treatment groups (P=0.362). Radiotherapy in second-line treatment and ICI rechallenge therapy were not the main factors affecting PFS2. Conclusions: ICI rechallenge therapy beyond disease progression did not improve clinical outcomes in patients with NSCLC, but no new safety signals emerged. However, patients with favorable response to initial ICIs treatment still showed significant efficacy of subsequent ICI rechallenge therapy.

TI  - Induction immunochemotherapy followed by definitive chemoradiotherapy for unresectable locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer: a multi-institutional retrospective cohort study
T2  - MEDCOMM
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of induction immunochemotherapy followed by definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for unresectable locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC). We identified unresectable stage III NSCLC patients who received induction immunochemotherapy. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were the primary endpoints. From February 2019 to August 2022, 158 patients were enrolled. Following the completion of induction immunochemotherapy, the objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) were 52.5% and 83.5%, respectively. The ORR of CRT was 73.5%, representing 68.4% of the total cohort. The median PFS was 17.8 months, and the median OS was 41.9 months, significantly higher than in patients who received CRT alone (p < 0.001). Patients with concurrent CRT demonstrated markedly improved PFS (p = 0.012) and OS (p = 0.017) than those undergoing sequential CRT. Additionally, those with a programmed-death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression of 50% or higher showed significantly elevated ORRs (72.2% vs. 47.2%, p = 0.011) and superior OS (median 44.8 vs. 28.6 months, p = 0.004) compared to patients with PD-L1 expression below 50%. Hematologic toxicities were the primary severe adverse events (grade >= 3) encountered, with no unforeseen treatment-related toxicities. Thus, induction immunochemotherapy followed by definitive CRT demonstrated encouraging efficacy and tolerable toxicities for unresectable LA-NSCLC.

TI  - Phase II Study of Immunotherapy With Tecemotide and Bevacizumab After Chemoradiation in Patients With Unresectable Stage III Non-Squamous Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NS-NSCLC): A Trial of the ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group (E6508)
T2  - CLINICAL LUNG CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the fact that chemoradiation is potentially curative for locally advanced non -small-cell lung cancer, many patients suffer from relapse. We studied the combination of tecemotide, a MUC1 antigen-specific immunotherapy vaccine, and bevacizumab after definitive chemoradiation in a single-arm phase II study. This trial demonstrated tolerability and encouraging outcomes and may support further investigation of antiangiogenic and immunotherapy combinations.Introduction: Although chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is the standard of care for patients with unresectable stage III non-small-cell lung cancer (LA- NSCLC), most patients relapse. Tecemotide is a MUC1 antigen- specific cancer immunotherapy vaccine. Bevacizumab improves survival in advanced nonsquamous (NS)-NSCLC and has a role in immune modulation. This phase II trial tested the combination of tecemotide and bevacizumab following CRT in patients with LA- NSCLC. Patients and Methods: Subjects with stage III NS-NSCLC suitable for CRT received carboplatin/paclitaxel weekly + 66 Gy followed by 2 cycles of consolidation carboplatin/paclitaxel <= 4 weeks of completion of CRT (Step 1). Patients with partial response/stable disease after consolidation therapy were registered onto step 2, which was 6 weekly tecemotide injections followed by every 6 weekly injections and bevacizumab every 3 weeks for up to 34 doses. The primary endpoint was to determine the safety of this regimen. Results: Seventy patients were enrolled; 68 patients (median age, 63 years; 56% male; 57% stage IIIA) initiated therapy, but only 39 patients completed CRT and consolidation therapy per protocol, primarily owing to disease progression or toxicity. Thirty-three patients (median age, 61 years; 58% male; 61% stage IIIA) were registered to step 2 (tecemotide + bevacizumab). The median number of step 2 cycles received was 11 (range, 2-25). Step 2 worst toxicity included grade 3, N = 9; grade 4, N = 1; and grade 5, N = 1. Grade 5 toxicity in step 2 was esophageal perforation attributed to bevacizumab. Among the treated and eligible patients (n = 32) who were treated on step 2, the median overall survival was 42.7 months (95% confidence interval, 21.7-63.3 months), and the median progression-free survival was 14.9 months (95% confidence interval, 11.0-20.9 months) from step 1 registration. Conclusions: This cooperative group trial met its endpoint, demonstrating tolerability of bevacizumab + tecemotide after CRT and consolidation. In this selected group of patients, the median progression-free survival and overall survival are encouraging. Given that consolidation immunotherapy is now a standard of care following CRT in patients with LA-NSCLC, these results support a role for continued investigation of antiangiogenic and immunotherapy combinations in LA-NSCLC.

TI  - Tumor-derived extracellular vesicles in the colorectal cancer immune environment and immunotherapy
T2  - PHARMACOLOGY & THERAPEUTICS
M3  - Review
AB  - Despite significant advances in the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC) immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) continue to have limited utility outside of microsatellite-high disease. Given the durable response to immunotherapy seen across malignancies, increasing CRC response rates to ICI therapy is an active area of clinical research. An increasing body of work has demonstrated that tumor-derived extracellular vesicles (TEVs) are key modulators in tumor signaling and the determinants of the tumor microenvironment. Pre-clinical models have shown that TEVs are directly involved in antigen presentation and are involved in radiation-induced DNA damage signaling. Both direct and indirect modifications of these TEVs can alter CRC immunogenicity and ICI treatment response, making them attractive targets for potential therapeutic develop-ment. In addition, modified TEVs can be developed using several different mechanisms, with varied cargo including micro-RNAs and small peptide molecules. Recent work has shown strong pre-clinical evidence of injected modified TEV-induced ICI activity, with knockdown of the micro-RNA miR-424 in TEVs improving CRC immunogenicity and increasing anti-PD-1 activity in mouse models. Clinical trials are ongoing in the evalu-ation of modified TEVs in cancer therapy, but they appear to be a promising therapeutic target in CRC.Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Site-Specific Response and Resistance Patterns in Patients with Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer Treated with First-Line Systemic Therapy
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Immunotherapy or combined chemoimmunotherapy is currently first-line therapy for patients with metastatic NSCLC without a driver mutation. Despite immunotherapy contributing to improved survival outcomes, the estimated 5-year OS rate for metastatic NSCLC remains poor. The aim of our retrospective study was to assess how patients with different anatomical metastatic sites respond or develop resistance to immunotherapy, combination chemoimmunotherapy, or chemotherapy alone. We confirmed that patients with bone metastases have poorer survival outcomes compared to those without bone metastases. This highlights a group of patients that may benefit from a specific clinical trial evaluation to assess the benefit of additional novel therapeutics or upfront radiotherapy.Abstract Patients with advanced NSCLC have heterogenous responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) with or without chemotherapy. In NSCLC, the impact of the distribution of metastatic sites and the response to systemic therapy combinations remain poorly understood. In a retrospective cohort study of patients with unresectable stage III/IV NSCLC who received first-line systemic therapy, we sought to assess the association between the site of metastases with patterns of response and progression. Data regarding demographics, tumour characteristics (including site, size, and volume of metastases), treatment, and outcomes were examined at two cancer care centres. The endpoints included organ site-specific response rate, objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Two-hundred and eighty-five patients were included in the analysis. In a multivariate analysis, patients with bone metastases had a reduced ORR, PFS, and OS. Primary resistance was also more likely in patients with bone metastases. Patients with bone or liver metastases had a shorter OS when receiving ICIs with or without chemotherapy, but not with chemotherapy alone, suggesting an immunological basis for therapeutic resistance. A directed assessment of the tumour microenvironment in these locations and a deeper understanding of the drivers of organ-specific resistance to immunotherapy are critical to optimise novel combination therapies and sequencing in these patients.

TI  - Neoadjuvant immunotherapy of locoregionally advanced solid tumors
T2  - JOURNAL FOR IMMUNOTHERAPY OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Definitive management of locoregionally advanced solid tumors presents a major challenge and often consists of a combination of surgical, radiotherapeutic and systemic therapy approaches. Upfront surgical treatment with or without adjuvant radiotherapy carries the risks of significant morbidities and potential complications that could be lasting. In addition, these patients continue to have a high risk of local or distant disease relapse despite the use of standard adjuvant therapy. Preoperative neoadjuvant systemic therapy has the potential to significantly improve clinical outcomes, particularly in this era of expanding immunotherapeutic agents that have transformed the care of patients with metastatic/unresectable malignancies. Tremendous progress has been made with neoadjuvant immunotherapy in the treatment of several locoregionally advanced resectable solid tumors leading to ongoing phase 3 trials and change in clinical practice. The promise of neoadjuvant immunotherapy has been supported by the high pathologic tumor response rates in early trials as well as the durability of these responses making cure a more achievable potential outcome compared with other forms of systemic therapy. Furthermore, neoadjuvant studies allow the assessment of radiologic and pathological responses and the access to biospecimens before and during systemic therapy. Pathological responses may guide future treatment decisions, and biospecimens allow the conduct of mechanistic and biomarker studies that may guide future drug development. On behalf of the National Cancer Institute Early Drug Development Neoadjuvant Immunotherapy Working Group, this article summarizes the current state of neoadjuvant immunotherapy of solid tumors focusing primarily on locoregionally advanced melanoma, gynecologic malignancies, gastrointestinal malignancies, non-small cell lung cancer and head and neck cancer including recent advances and our expert recommendations related to future neoadjuvant trial designs and associated clinical and translational research questions.

TI  - Exploratory analysis to predict pneumonitis during durvalumab consolidation therapy for patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer from proteomic profiling of circulating extracellular vesicles
T2  - THORACIC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Risk factors for predicting pneumonitis during durvalumab consolidation after chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC) are still lacking. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) play a crucial role in intercellular communication and are potential diagnostic tools for various diseases.Methods We retrospectively collected predurvalumab treatment serum samples from patients treated with durvalumab for LA-NSCLC, isolated EVs using anti-CD9 and anti-CD63 antibodies, and performed proteomic analyses. We examined EV proteins that could predict the development of symptomatic pneumonitis (SP) during durvalumab treatment. Potential EV-protein biomarkers were validated in an independent cohort.Results In the discovery cohort, 73 patients were included, 49 with asymptomatic pneumonitis (AP) and 24 with SP. Of the 5797 proteins detected in circulating EVs, 33 were significantly elevated (fold change [FC] > 1.5, p < 0.05) in the SP group, indicating enrichment of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) pathway. Patients with high levels of EV-RELA, an NF-kappa B subunit, had a higher incidence of SP than those with low levels of EV-RELA (53.8% vs. 13.4%, p = 0.0017). In the receiver operating characteristic analysis, EV-RELA demonstrated a higher area under the curve (AUC) than lung V20 (0.76 vs. 0.62) and was identified as an independent risk factor in the multivariate logistic regression analysis (p = 0.008, odds ratio 7.72). Moreover, high EV-RELA was also a predictor of SP in the validation cohort comprising 43 patients (AUC of 0.80).Conclusions Circulating EV-RELA may be a predictive marker for symptomatic pneumonitis in patients with LA-NSCLC treated with durvalumab.

TI  - Thoracic Radiotherapy in Extensive Disease Small Cell Lung Cancer: Multicenter Prospective Observational TRENDS Study
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for about 15% of all lung cancers, and seventy percent of patients already have advanced disease at diagnosis. In advanced disease, the use of consolidative chest RT should be recommended for patients with good response to platinum-based first-line chemotherapy, but its use has not yet been standardized. This prospective study was carried out with the intention of evaluating the spread in Italy of the use of thoracic RT in ES-SCLC, with a focus on the pattern of care (RT modalities, volumes and doses) and its effectiveness in terms of disease control and tolerability. From January 2017 to December 2019, sixty-four patients were enrolled. An extensive variability in doses, treatment volume and technique were recorded. Nevertheless, consolidative RT was well-tolerated by all patients and, after treatment, over 66% of patients did not experience in-field progression, and it has been shown to be useful in reducing the risk of thoracic disease progression in patients with advanced stage SCLC, with good response after first-line chemotherapy. (1) Introduction: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive tumor type, accounting for about 15% of all lung cancers. Radiotherapy (RT) plays a fundamental role in both early and advanced stages. Currently, in advanced disease, the use of consolidative chest RT should be recommended for patients with good response to platinum-based first-line chemotherapy, but its use has not yet been standardized. The present prospective study aims to evaluate the pattern of care of consolidative chest RT in patients with advanced stage SCLC, and its effectiveness in terms of disease control and tolerability. (2) Materials and methods: This study was a multicenter prospective observational trial, proposed and conducted within the AIRO lung study group to evaluate the pattern of care of consolidative chest RT after first-line chemotherapy in patients with advanced SCLC. The patient and tumor characteristics, doses, fractionation and volumes of thoracic RT and prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI), as well as the thoracic and extrathoracic response to the treatment, toxicity and clinical outcomes, were collected and analyzed. (3) Results: From January 2017 to December 2019, sixty-four patients were enrolled. Median follow-up was 33 months. The median age was 68 years (range 42-81); 38 patients (59%) were male and 26 (41%) female. Carboplatin + etoposide for 6 cycles was the most commonly used first-line therapeutic scheme (42%). With regard to consolidative chest RT, 56% of patients (35) received 30 Gy in 10 factions and 16 patients (26%) received 45 Gy in 15 sessions. The modulated intensity technique was used in 84.5% of cases, and post-chemotherapy macroscopic residual disease was the target volume in 87.5% of patients. Forty-four patients (69%) also underwent PCI. At the last follow-up, over 60% of patients did not experience chest disease progression, while 67% showed extrathoracic progression. At the first radiological evaluation after RT, complete response and stable disease were recorded in 6% and 46% of the cases, respectively. Two patients had a long-term complete response to the combined treatment. The brain was the first site of extrathoracic progression in 28%. 1y and 2y OS and PFS were 67%, 19%, 28% and 6%, respectively. Consolidative chest RT was well-tolerated in the majority of patients; it was interrupted in three cases (due to G2 pulmonary toxicity, disease progression and clinical decay, respectively). Only 1 patient developed G3 asthenia.(4) Conclusions: Consolidative chest RT has been shown to be useful in reducing the risk of thoracic disease progression and is absolutely well-tolerated in patients with advanced stage SCLC with good response after first-line chemotherapy. Among the Italian centers that participated in this study, there is still variability in the choice of fractionation and target volumes, although the guidelines contain clear recommendations. The aim of future research should be to clarify the role and modalities of chest RT in the era of immunotherapy in advanced-stage SCLC.

TI  - Therapeutic approaches for LKB1-deficient non-small cell lung cancer
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - ﻿   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. In recent years dramatic progress has been made in tailoring therapies for subgroups of patients harboring specific genomic alterations, such as EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors for the 10-15% of patients bearing EGFR mutations, and through the use drugs blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint pathway. Unfortunately, only a minority of patients benefit from these approaches. LKB1 (STK11) is the second most commonly altered tumor suppressor in NSCLC, and is lost in 20-30% of lung adenocarcinoma, resulting in 30,000-40,000 deaths annually. There is a major unmet need for therapeutic strategies tailored for LKB1-deficient (LD) NSCLC. Project investigators have demonstrated that LKB1 loss is associated with increased metastatic potential, chemotherapy resistance, and, more recently, with an immunosuppressed phenotype as well as resistance to checkpoint inhibitors. Given our initial findings, we hypothesize that a) LKB1 loss directly drives a distinctve immunosuppressed phenotype, and that potential underlying mechanisms include reduced antigen presentation and/or altered cytokine production; and b) therapeutic regimens can be developed to enhance the antitumor immune response and overcome resistance to checkpoint inhibition. We will test these hypotheses in the following aims. In Aim 1, we will characterize theimmunosuppressed phenotype of LD-NSCLC, by a) investigating the mechanisms underlying the LD-associated intratumor immunosuppression in preclinical models, including reduced antigen presentation and altered production of immunosuppressive cytokines such as IL-6 and VEGF; and b) comparing the immune phenotype in LD and LKB1-intact (LI) tumors from NSCLC patients. Next, in Aim 2, we will use insights gained from Aim 1 to develop more effective immunotherapy approaches, by testing a) direct and indirect cytokine suppression, b) combinations of cytokine suppression with anti-PD1, to determine whether we can overcome the LD-associated resistance to checkpoint inhibition; and c) combinations with radiotherapy (RT) and other approaches enhancing antigen presentation. Finally, in Aim 3, we will translate this work into the clinic using a recently activated randomized clinical trial testing the anti-PD- antibody pembrolizumab, alone or combined with RT in 104 NSCLC patients. This will enable us to test our preclinical observations regarding the relative resistance of LD-NSCLC to PD-1 inhibition, and determine whether RT can enhance anti-tumor immunity and overcome PD-1 inhibitor resistance in LD NSCLC patients. Clinical significance: LD-NSCLC causes more deaths than pancreatic cancer, and there are critical unmet needs for new treatment approaches and insights into its distinct biology. We have assembled a multidisciplinary team of leading investigators to tackle these needs, with deep expertise in lung cancer genomics, immunotherapy, pathology, mouse models and radiotherapy that is poised to rapidly translate discoveries directly into clinical advances for NSCLC patients.

TI  - Differential Effect of Consolidative Thoracic Radiation Therapy in Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer Based on Sex
T2  - ADVANCES IN RADIATION ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: The landmark randomized trial on chest irradiation in extensive disease small cell lung cancer (CREST) demonstrated that consolidative thoracic radiation therapy (cTRT) improved overall (OS) and progression -free survival (PFS) after initial chemotherapy (chemo) in extensive -stage small cell lung cancer, with potentially increased benefit in women compared with men. It is unknown whether similar findings would apply after chemoimmunotherapy became the standard first -line treatment. In this analysis, we report national practice patterns and survival outcomes of cTRT according to patient sex. Methods and Materials: We included patients from de -identified electronic health record -derived database diagnosed with stage IV small cell lung cancer (2014-2021) who completed 4 to 6 cycles of first -line systemic therapy (platinum -doublet chemotherapy or chemoimmunotherapy). We evaluated OS and PFS using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression with receipt of cTRT as an independent variable and stratified by sex. As a sensitivity analysis, we weighted the models by the inverse probability of receiving cTRT. Results: A total of 1227 patients were included (850 chemotherapy, 377 chemoimmunotherapy). There were no statistically significant differences in baseline characteristics between patients who did and did not receive cTRT. Among women, cTRT was associated with superior OS (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.67; 95% CI, 0.52-0.87) and PFS (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.49-0.82) compared with those not receiving cTRT. Conversely, no OS or PFS benefit with cTRT was observed in men (OS HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.80-1.31; PFS HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.85-1.47). Findings were similar in weighted analyses. Conclusions: The survival efficacy of cTRT may be moderated by sex, with female patients appearing more likely to benefit than male patients. These findings refiect sex -based survival trends with similar effect sizes to those observed in the CREST trial. Although the underpinnings of this association need to be elucidated, stratification by sex should be considered for randomized -controlled trials studying cTRT in extensive -stage small cell lung cancer.

TI  - Extended resections for the treatment of patients with T4 stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (T<sub>4</sub>N<sub>0-1</sub>M<sub>0</sub>) with or without cardiopulmonary bypass: a 15-year two-center experience
T2  - JOURNAL OF THORACIC DISEASE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a heterogeneous group of patients, often requiring variable and individualized approaches. The dilemma to operate or not frequently arises, since more than 75% of the cases of NSCLC are diagnosed in advanced stages (IIIA). The main objective of this study was to assess whether the benefits outweigh surgical risks for the T4N0-1M0 subgroup.Methods: Data from 857 patients with locally advanced T4 NSCLC were retrospectively collected from two different institutions, between 2002 and 2017. Clinical data that were retrieved and analyzed, included demographics, comorbidities, surgical details, neoadjuvant or/and adjuvant therapy and postoperative complications.Results: Twelve patients were in the cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) group and thirty in the non-CPB. The most common types of lung cancer were squamous cell carcinoma (50.0%) and adenocarcinoma (35.7%). The most frequent invasion of the tumor was seen in main pulmonary artery and the superior vena cava. Significantly more patients of the CPB group underwent pneumonectomy as their primary lung resection (P=0.006). In all patients R0 resection was achieved according to histological reports. The overall 5-year survival was 60%, while the median overall survival was 22.5 months. Analysis revealed that patient age (P=0.027), preoperative chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (P=0.001), tumor size (4.0 vs. 6.0 cm) (P=0.001), postoperative respiratory dysfunction (P=0.001) and postoperative atelectasis ( P=0.036) are possible independent variables that are significantly correlated with patient outcome.Conclusions: We suggest that in patients with stage IIIA/T4 NSCLC, complete resection of the T4 tumor, although challenging, can be performed in highly selected patients. Such an approach seems to result in improved long-term survival. More specific studies on this area of NSCLC probably will further enlighten this field, and may result in even better outcomes, as advanced systemic perioperative approaches such as modern chemotherapy, immunotherapy and improvements in radiation therapy have been incorporated in daily practice.

TI  - Salvage surgery following immuno-chemo-radiotherapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer
T2  - SURGICAL CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Salvage surgery following definitive radiotherapy or systemic treatment has become a feasible treatment option in selected patients with advanced initially unresectable non-small cell lung cancer. Recent clinical trials of neoadjuvant treatment have showed that surgery following immuno-chemotherapy is safely performed. Here, we present the first case of salvage surgery following immuno-chemotherapy with concurrent definitive radiotherapy for advanced lung large cell carcinoma. Case presentation A 44-year male was admitted to our hospital for salvage surgery. Ten months prior to this administration, he had been diagnosed with unresectable large cell carcinoma with malignant pericardial effusion (clinical stage IVA/T3N2M1A; no driver-gene alteration) originating from the right upper lobe (RUL). Due to rapid intrabronchial tumor growth causing severe dyspnea, emergency bronchial stenting in the right main bronchus using an expandable metallic stent had been performed. Thereafter, he had received immuno-chemotherapy with concurrent definitive radiotherapy. Despite dramatic radiographic response, he had suffered from persistent and refractory Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infection associated with bronchial stent placement. As pericardial effusion had disappeared and no distant metastasis had developed, he was diagnosed with a potentially curable disease and was referred to our hospital. An extended sleeve resection was successfully performed, and pathological sections revealed that pathologic complete response was achieved with immuno-chemo-radiotherapy. The patient received no subsequent treatment, and is alive without tumor recurrence at 8 months after surgery. Conclusions Salvage surgery following immuno-chemotherapy with concurrent definitive radiotherapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer may be feasible in selected patients, and may be considered as a treatment option to control local disease.

TI  - Therapeutic approaches for LKB1-deficient non-small cell lung cancer
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Therapeutic advances have been made in the treatment of subpopulations of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who harbor specific genomic alterations (e.g. EGFR mutation and ALK ROS gene rearrangements) which can be targeted with small molecule kinase inhibitors; however, the serine/threonine kinase STK11 (LKB1) is the second most commonly altered tumor suppressors in NSCLC, with genomic loss or inactivating mutations occurring in 20-30% of lung adenocarcinoma and there are currently no treatment strategies tailored for LKB1-deficient NSCLC. The PIs have developed preliminary data showing that in human tumor specimens and in Genetically Engineered Mouse Models of NSCLC with Lkb1 deletion that loss of LKB1 is associated with higher stage of disease at presentation, increased metastasis and poor overall prognosis as well as unique biological characteristics. This proposal will deeply characterize the distinct biology of LKB1- deficient NSCLCs with a focus on the immune microenvironment as a means to develop novel therapeutic approaches for patients with LKB1-deficient NSCLCs.

TI  - Perspective on treatment for unresectable locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer with oncogene-driven mutation: a narrative review
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL LUNG CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - The standard treatment of unresectable locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA NSCLC) is concurrent chemoradiotherapy. With the addition of immunotherapy, patients with LA NSCLC received a significantly prolonged outcome, while patients with harboring epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation benefited less. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have revolutionized the treatment of stage IV with harboring EGFR mutation and anaplastic lymphoma kinase rearrangement, but there are few recommendations indicating whether TKI treatment is effective in unresectable NSCLC. Preclinical studies have shown that TKIs could have a radiosensitizing effect, which provided a rationale to consider the application TKI with radiotherapy. In this review, we summarize the clinical studies that have used TKIs in LA-NSCLC as well as ongoing trials, and discuss recent progress in research related to the efficacy of TKI for unresectable LA NSCLC patients. Recent results of small studies evaluating TKI therapy for LA NSCLC patients in combination with radiation or chemoradiation demonstrated promising efficacy, improved outcomes with a tolerable toxicity profile. However, there is a lack of strong evidence for TKI treatment in unresectable LA NSCLC, because of unpowered statistics, lack of molecular selection, or lack of large randomized arms. We prospect the combination of TKI and radiation or chemoradiation therapy might eventually replace the current standard treatment for patients with LA NSCLC harboring oncogene-driven mutation.

TI  - High-dose irradiation in combination with toll-like receptor 9 agonist CpG oligodeoxynucleotide 7909 downregulates PD-L1 expression via the NF-κB signaling pathway in non-small cell lung cancer cells
T2  - ONCOTARGETS AND THERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Irradiation resistance appears as local recurrence and distant metastasis in advanced stages of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). High-dose irradiation combined with immunotherapy improved overall survival and local control of NSCLC. This study explored the underlying molecular mechanism by which the effect of high-dose irradiation plus toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonist CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG ODN) 7909 on NSCLC.Materials and methods: NSCLC H460 cells were exposed to constant high-dose irradiation (6.37 Gy) in irradiation (IR) group and the irradiation plus CpG group. Gene expression was assessed using quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. Knockdown of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) p65 expression was conducted using p65 siRNA.Results: Expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) mRNA was significantly decreased in IR combined with CpG ODN 7909 group compared with the control or IR-alone groups (P<0.05). TLR9 expression was also obviously increased in the combination group compared with the control (P<0.05). Moreover, expression of NF-kappa B p65 was apparently reduced in the combination group compared with the control (P<0.05). However, expression of PD-L1 was significantly decreased after knockdown of p65 in IR group (P<0.05), but increased in the combination group (P<0.05) and slightly increased in CpG ODN-alone group (P<0.05), which was opposite to that without p65 knockdown group.Conclusion: This study demonstrated that radiotherapy combined with CpG ODN 7909 was able to downregulate PD-L1 expression through inhibition via the NF-kappa B signaling pathway.

TI  - Therapeutic approaches for LKB1-deficient non-small cell lung cancer
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - ﻿   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. In recent years dramatic progress has been made in tailoring therapies for subgroups of patients harboring specific genomic alterations, such as EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors for the 10-15% of patients bearing EGFR mutations, and through the use drugs blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint pathway. Unfortunately, only a minority of patients benefit from these approaches. LKB1 (STK11) is the second most commonly altered tumor suppressor in NSCLC, and is lost in 20-30% of lung adenocarcinoma, resulting in 30,000-40,000 deaths annually. There is a major unmet need for therapeutic strategies tailored for LKB1-deficient (LD) NSCLC. Project investigators have demonstrated that LKB1 loss is associated with increased metastatic potential, chemotherapy resistance, and, more recently, with an immunosuppressed phenotype as well as resistance to checkpoint inhibitors. Given our initial findings, we hypothesize that a) LKB1 loss directly drives a distinctve immunosuppressed phenotype, and that potential underlying mechanisms include reduced antigen presentation and/or altered cytokine production; and b) therapeutic regimens can be developed to enhance the antitumor immune response and overcome resistance to checkpoint inhibition. We will test these hypotheses in the following aims. In Aim 1, we will characterize theimmunosuppressed phenotype of LD-NSCLC, by a) investigating the mechanisms underlying the LD-associated intratumor immunosuppression in preclinical models, including reduced antigen presentation and altered production of immunosuppressive cytokines such as IL-6 and VEGF; and b) comparing the immune phenotype in LD and LKB1-intact (LI) tumors from NSCLC patients. Next, in Aim 2, we will use insights gained from Aim 1 to develop more effective immunotherapy approaches, by testing a) direct and indirect cytokine suppression, b) combinations of cytokine suppression with anti-PD1, to determine whether we can overcome the LD-associated resistance to checkpoint inhibition; and c) combinations with radiotherapy (RT) and other approaches enhancing antigen presentation. Finally, in Aim 3, we will translate this work into the clinic using a recently activated randomized clinical trial testing the anti-PD- antibody pembrolizumab, alone or combined with RT in 104 NSCLC patients. This will enable us to test our preclinical observations regarding the relative resistance of LD-NSCLC to PD-1 inhibition, and determine whether RT can enhance anti-tumor immunity and overcome PD-1 inhibitor resistance in LD NSCLC patients. Clinical significance: LD-NSCLC causes more deaths than pancreatic cancer, and there are critical unmet needs for new treatment approaches and insights into its distinct biology. We have assembled a multidisciplinary team of leading investigators to tackle these needs, with deep expertise in lung cancer genomics, immunotherapy, pathology, mouse models and radiotherapy that is poised to rapidly translate discoveries directly into clinical advances for NSCLC patients.

TI  - Analysis of Circulating Tumor DNA Predicts Outcomes of Short-Course Consolidation Immunotherapy in Unresectable Stage III NSCLC.
T2  - Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Clinical Trial, Phase II
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The current standard of care for patients with inoperable stage III non-small cell lung cancer includes chemoradiotherapy (CRT) followed by 1 year of checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) therapy. Nevertheless, the optimal duration of consolidation CPI remains unknown. Here, we characterized the relationship between circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) minimal residual disease (MRD) and clinical outcomes of patients with unresectable locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer treated on a phase 2 trial of short-course consolidation immunotherapy after CRT, with the goal of testing whether ctDNA may be able toidentify patients who do not require a full year of treatment.METHODS: Plasma samples for ctDNA analysis were collected from patients on the Big Ten Cancer Research Consortium LUN 16-081 trial after completion of CRT, before day 1 of cycle 2 (C2D1) of CPI (i.e., 1 mo after treatment start), and at the end of up to 6 months of treatment. Tumor-informed ctDNA MRD analysis was performed using cancer personalized profiling by deep sequencing. Levels of ctDNA at each time point were correlated with clinical outcomes.RESULTS: Detection of ctDNA predicted significantly inferior progression-free survival after completion of CRT (24-mo 29% versus 65%, p= 0.0048), before C2D1 of CPI (24-mo 0% versus 72%, p < 0.0001) and at the end of CPI (24-mo 15% versus 67%, p= 0.0011). In addition, patients with decreasing or undetectable ctDNA levels after 1 cycle of CPI had improved outcomes compared with patients with increasing ctDNA levels (24-mo progression-free survival 72% versus 0%, p < 0.0001). Progression of disease occurred within less than 12 months of starting CPI in all patients with increasing ctDNA levels at C2D1.CONCLUSIONS: Detection of ctDNA before, during, or after 6 months of consolidation CPI is strongly associated with inferior outcomes. Our findings suggest that analysis of ctDNA MRD may enable personalizing the duration of consolidation immunotherapy treatment.

TI  - Challenges to multimodal treatment of elderly patients with lung cancer
T2  - ONKOLOGIE
M3  - Review
AB  - Despite continuous improvements in early detection and interdisciplinary treatment approaches, locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) continues to have a high incidence and dismal prognosis. It is commonly diagnosed in elderly patients, in whom frailty and comorbidities may challenge the feasibility of intensified multimodality treatment. Rather than chronological age, comorbidities should be considered in the design and realization of the recommended treatments. Dose- and substance-adapted chemotherapies and precisely planned and administered radiotherapy may offer attractive treatment options. Genomic analyses should always be performed, as a relevant number of patients may benefit from the commonly less toxic tyrosine or checkpoint inhibitors. Such personalized and interdisciplinary therapies have been shown to be both feasible and highly effective in an aging lung cancer population.

TI  - CD8-Targeted PET Imaging of Tumor-Infiltrating T Cells in Patients with Cancer: A Phase I First-in-Humans Study of <SUP>89</SUP>Zr-Df-IAB22M2C, a Radiolabeled Anti-CD8 Minibody
T2  - JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a need for in vivo diagnostic imaging probes that can noninvasively measure tumor-infiltrating CD8+ leukocytes. Such imaging probes could be used to predict early response to cancer immunotherapy, help select effective single or combination immunotherapies, and facilitate the development of new immunotherapies or immunotherapy combinations. This study was designed to optimize conditions for performing CD8 PET imaging with Zr-89-Df-IAB22M2C and determine whether CD8 PET imaging could provide a safe and effective noninvasive method of visualizing the whole-body biodistribution of CD8+ leukocytes. Methods: We conducted a phase 1 first-in humans PET imaging study using an anti-CD8 radiolabeled minibody, Zr-89-Df-IAB22M2C, to detect whole-body and tumor CD8+ leukocyte distribution in patients with metastatic solid tumors. Patients received 111 MBq of Zr-89-Df-IAB22M2C followed by serial PET scanning over 5-7 d. A 2-stage design included a dose-escalation phase and a dose-expansion phase. Biodistribution, radiation dosimetry, and semiquantitative evaluation of Zr-89-Df-IAB22M2C uptake were performed in all patients. Results: Fifteen subjects with metastatic melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma were enrolled. No drug-related adverse events or abnormal laboratory results were noted except for a transient increase in antidrug antibodies in 1 subject. Zr-89-Df-IAB22M2C accumulated in tumors and CD8rich tissues (e.g., spleen, bone marrow, nodes), with maximum uptake at 24-48 h after injection and low background activity in CD8-poor tissues (e.g., muscle and lung). Radiotracer uptake in tumors was noted in 10 of 15 subjects, including 7 of 8 subjects on immunotherapy, 1 of 2 subjects on targeted therapy, and 2 of 5 treatment-naive subjects. In 3 patients with advanced melanoma or hepatocellular carcinoma on immunotherapy, posttreatment CD8 PET/CT scans demonstrated increased 89Zr-Df-IAB22M2C uptake in tumor lesions, which correlated with response. Conclusion: CD8 PET imaging with Zr-89-Df-IAB22M2C is safe and has the potential to visualize the whole-body biodistribution of CD8+ leukocytes in tumors and reference tissues, and may predict early response to immunotherapy.

TI  - Consolidative Thoracic Radiation Therapy After First-Line Chemotherapy and Immunotherapy in Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Multi-Institutional Case Series
T2  - ADVANCES IN RADIATION ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Survival for patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) remains poor. Consolidative thoracic radiation therapy (cTRT) and upfront immunotherapy with chemotherapy have each incrementally improved patient outcomes, but have not yet been combined in clinical trials. We sought to characterize outcomes and toxicities after first-line chemotherapy and immunotherapy followed by cTRT.& nbsp;Methods and Materials: Patients with ES-SCLC who were treated with first-line chemotherapy and immunotherapy followed by cTRT were identified at 2 institutions. Patient outcomes including overall survival (OS), progression-free survival, local progression free survival, distant progression free-survival, and toxicity were assessed.& nbsp;Results: Twenty patients were included in our data set treated from 2018 to 2021 with a median follow-up of 12 months. Median OS in this cohort was 16 months with 6-month OS of 94.7% and 12-month OS of 77.5% (comparable to historical controls). There were also low rates of toxicity, including 0% grade 3+ toxicity, 0% grade 2 pneumonitis, and 5% grade 2 esophagitis.& nbsp;Conclusions: Treatment of ES-SCLC with first-line chemoimmunotherapy followed by cTRT appears to be safe and to have outcomes comparable to published modern clinical trials. Further studies are warranted to determine the therapeutic effect of cTRT after chemoimmunotherapy. (C)& nbsp;2021 The Authors.

TI  - Alternative Multidisciplinary Management Options for Locally Advanced NSCLC During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Global Pandemic
T2  - JOURNAL OF THORACIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is currently accelerating. Patients with locally advanced NSCLC (LA-NSCLC) may require treatment in locations where resources are limited, and the prevalence of infection is high. Patients with LA-NSCLC frequently present with comorbidities that increase the risk of severe morbidity and mortality from COVID-19. These risks may be further increased by treatments for LA-NSCLC. Although guiding data is scarce, we present an expert thoracic oncology multidisciplinary (radiation oncology, medical oncology, surgical oncology) consensus of alternative strategies for the treatment of LA-NSCLC during a pandemic. The over-arching goals of these approaches are the following: (1) reduce the number of visits to a health care facility, (2) reduce the risk of exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2, (3) attenuate the immunocom-promising effects of lung cancer therapies, and (4) provide effective oncologic therapy. Patients with resectable disease can be treated with de finitive nonoperative management if surgical resources are limited or the risks of perioperative care are high. Nonoperative options include chemotherapy, chemoimmunotherapy, and radiation therapy with sequential schedules that may or may not affect long-term outcomes in an era in which immunotherapy is available. The order of treatments may be on the basis of patient factors and clinical resources. Whenever radiation therapy is delivered without concurrent chemotherapy, hypo-fractionated schedules are appropriate. For patients who are con firmed to have COVID-19, usually, cancer therapies may be withheld until symptoms have resolved with negative viral test results. The risk of severe treatment-related morbidity and mortality is increased for patients undergoing treatment for LA-NSCLC during the COVID-19 pandemic. Adapting alternative treatment stra-tegies as quickly as possible may save lives and should be implemented through communication with the multidisci-plinary cancer team.

TI  - Clinical outcomes of atezolizumab in combination with etoposide/platinum for treatment of extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer: A real-world, multicenter, retrospective, controlled study in China
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Atezolizumab along with chemotherapy has prolonged the survival of patients with extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) worldwide, although real-world (RW) data are lacking in China. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and clinical outcomes of atezolizumab plus etoposide/platinum (EP). Methods: Data obtained in this retrospective study were captured from six oncology units of five medical facilities from January 2019 to April 2022. For first-line treatments, atezolizumab combined with EP vs. EP alone, we primarily evaluated progression-free survival (PFS); other efficacy indicators, including overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and patterns of SCLC progression and adverse events (AEs) were assessed. Results: The primary analysis included data from 225 patients, of whom 133 received EP along with atezolizumab (atezolizumab group) and 92 received EP alone (EP group). The PFS duration of the atezolizumab group [7.10 months; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 6.53-9.00] exceeded that of the EP group (6.50 months; 95% CI, 4.83-7.53). Overall, the hazard ratio (HR) was 0.69 (95% CI, 0.49-0.97) (P=0.029); particularly, the HR was 0.54 (95% CI, 0.36-0.80) among patients undergoing >= 4 chemotherapy cycles and 0.33 (95% CI, 0.20-0.56) among individuals with atezolizumab maintenance. The ORR and disease-control rate (DCR) were similar between the two groups. Because of incomplete OS data, the median OS was not determined for either group. Bone marrow suppression was the most common AE detected (58.6%) in the atezolizumab group. Immune-related AEs occurred in 19 patients in the atezolizumab group (14.3%), with only one case of grade 3 encephalitis. Conclusions: This RW study in China demonstrated improved clinical outcomes of atezolizumab along with EP for ES-SCLC, particularly in the chemosensitive population. These results align with the results of the the of this treatment on OS warrants additional studies.

TI  - Epigenetic Therapy for Thoracic Malignancies
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - Our published studies pertaining to laboratory experiments and our related clinical protocols have clearly demonstrated that Decitabine and romidepsin alone or in combination can modulate gene expression in thoracic malignancies and induce immune responses against these neoplasms. Our goal has always been to couple epigenetic priming regimens with adoptive immunotherapy for thoracic malignancies. Presently, poor biodistribution and systemic toxicities prevent optimal, chronic administration of epigenetic agents necessary to reprogram thoracic malignancies. To overcome these limitations, we formulated DAC and tetrahydrouridine (a potent, non-toxic inhibitor of cytidine deaminase) for oral administration in collaboration with the Cleveland Clinic. A phase I/II study of oral DAC/THU and pembrolizumab for patients with inoperable NSCLC, esophageal cancers, or malignant pleural mesotheliomas was initialed in late 2017, but was closed this year due to drug stability issues. This was unfortunate as virtually all patients had exhibited evidence of systemic epigenetic reprogramming, and impressive, near complete and durable responses were observed in several patients. To further optimize epigenetic priming of pulmonary malignancies for immune checkpoint blockade while decreasing potential systemic toxicities, we recently initiated preclinical studies to examine the pharmacokinetics and potential efficacy of azacytidine (AZA) administered by aerosolization techniques. We have developed a unique immunocompetent murine pulmonary metastasis model using cancer stem cells isolated from highly lethal syngeneic lung cancer and sarcoma cell lines for systematic, rational evaluation of DNA demethylating agents, LSD1 inhibitors, and cytokines such as IL-12. A phase I/II clinical protocol trial to examine the toxicities and potential efficacy of AZA administered via inhalation techniques in combination with durvalumab as induction therapy for patients with operable NSCLC is presently undergoing FDA review. This trial is intended to establish the paradigm for evaluation of a series of aerosolized epigenetic agents alone or in combination with adoptive immunotherapy for the treatment of locally advanced pulmonary malignancies. No such clinical efforts are currently underway elsewhere in the world. Results of our preclinical and translational research efforts were presented as a formal plenary session talk at the Annual Meeting of the AACR in 2023. Cancer-germline antigens comprise a group of shared tumor antigens that are only expressed in cancers arising from somatic cells or immune-privileged sites such as testes, ovary, or placenta. As such, cancer-germline antigens have emerged as highly attractive targets for cancer immunotherapy. Although cancer-germline antigens are expressed in a variety of human malignancies, immune responses to these proteins are uncommon in thoracic oncology patients due to low level, heterogeneous antigen expression, deficient antigen processing/presentation, and local as well as systemic immunosuppression. Our published studies from cell lines and patient biopsies have demonstrated that thoracic malignancies exhibit diverse patterns of CTA expression and heterogeneous responses to epigenetic regimens that up-regulate these proteins. A strategy to overcome these limitations is to immunize patients against a panel of CTAs that potentially can be upregulated by systemic administration of chromatin remodeling agents. Following positive results of a phase 2.5 First-in-Human trial evaluating the use of a cancer cell lysate vaccine as adjuvant therapy in patients with primary thoracic malignancies or tumors metastatic to the lungs, we have written two new protocols using this lysate vaccine (which was developed in our lab) as adjuvant therapy for patients with lung or esophageal cancers. The lung cancer protocol will evaluate the lysate vaccine in combination with the IL-15 super-agonist N-803 as post-operative adjuvant therapy, while the esophageal cancer protocol will evaluate the lysate in combination with the HDAC inhibitor, entinostat, and the immune checkpoint inhibitor, nivolumab following chemo-radiation +/- surgery. Both protocols have been approved by the FDA and NIH IRB and are expected to be open for patient accrual in early Q1 of FY24.

TI  - A phase II, multicenter study of lazertinib as consolidation therapy in patients with locally advanced, unresectable, <i>EGFR</i> mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer (stage III) who have not progressed following definitive, platinum-based, chemoradiation therapy (PLATINUM trial)
T2  - THORACIC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction The PACIFIC study demonstrated that durvalumab consolidation therapy significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT). However, there was no clinical benefit in both PFS and OS in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation-positive patient groups in a post hoc exploratory analysis. Moreover, the clinical effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in EGFR mutation-positive stage IV NSCLC were demonstrated to be poor. Personalized treatment according to the mutation status is also required in stage III NSCLC. Lazertinib, a third-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), is newly developed and approved for use in Korea. Methods This prospective, open, single-arm, multicenter, phase II clinical trial aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lazertinib as a consolidative therapy after CCRT treatment in unresectable, EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC stage III patients. The primary endpoint of this study is PFS, and the secondary endpoints are OS, objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DoR), time to death or distant metastasis (TTDM), and safety profiles. Discussion Our study may extend the indications for third-generation EGFR-TKIs to treat patients with stage III NSCLC. Moreover, using this drug to treat stage III NSCLC would emphasize the value of mutation analysis and personalized medicine.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Surgical resection is the most effective therapeutic option for the cure in early stage resectable non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, despite complete resection, up to 70% of patients die within 5 years mainly due to tumor recurrence in extra-thoracic organs. Adjuvant or neoadjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy may improve postoperative survival, but the absolute survival benefit is modest with an around 5% improvement at 5 years. Recent advance in systemic therapy has changed treatment strategy for advanced unresectable NSCLC, and also has provided a paradigm shift in treatment strategy for resectable NSCLC. For NSCLC without oncogenic driver alterations, immunotherapy using immune-checkpoint inhibitors may improve clinical outcomes in preoperative neoadjuvant setting as well as in postoperative adjuvant setting. Here, we overview recent evidence of adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapy and discuss emerging clinical questions in decision-making of treatment for potentially resectable patients with NSCLC harboring no oncogenic alterations.

TI  - Combination of Radiotherapy and Targeted Agents in Brain Metastasis: An Update
T2  - CURRENT TREATMENT OPTIONS IN NEUROLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The combination of radiation therapy and targeted agents (molecular inhibitors or immunotherapy) represents an opportunity to improve the outcomes of patients with brain metastases. The combination of whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) with targeted agents takes advantage of radiosensitization, while the combination with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) may allow one to substitute an effective systemic agent for adjuvant WBRT, the historical standard of care. This strategy may in turn allow the promotion of secondary prevention paradigms with possibly less cognitive toxicity. At present, the combination of targeted therapy with SRS rather than with WBRT is the more viable option although both avenues will likely have a role in the future management of brain metastases. Patients should be encouraged to enter clinical trials since the off-study use of these combinations will delay the advancement of the field. Caution is advised in the combination of radiation and targeted agents as unexpected toxicities can occur. Clinicians should avail themselves of clinical trials in order to offer patients these promising options and to move the field forward. In the absence of a clinical trial, we recommend the combination of SRS with targeted agents and deferred WBRT. Small, asymptomatic brain metastases may be best managed with single-modality targeted agents with deferred radiation therapy, preferably on a clinical trial. Advances in targeted therapies combined with radiation therapy will most likely improve local control and hopefully the quality of life and survival of patients with brain metastasis.

M3  - Review
AB  - Opinion statement Systemic therapy for brain metastases (BM) is quickly moving from conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy toward targeted therapies, that allow a disruption of driver molecular pathways. The discovery of actionable driver mutations has led to the development of an impressive number of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), that target the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, anaplastic-lymphoma-kinase (ALK) rearrangements, and other rare molecular alterations in patients bearing metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the brain, with remarkable results in terms of intracranial disease control and overall survival. Moreover, these drugs may delay the use of local therapies, such as stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) or whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT). New drugs with higher molecular specificity and ability to cross the CNS barriers (BBB, BTB and blood-CSF) are being developed. Two major issues are related to targeted therapies. First, the emergence of a resistance is a common event, and a deeper understanding of molecular pathways that are involved is critical for the successful development of effective new targeted agents. Second, an early detection of tumor progression is of utmost importance to avoid the prolongation of an ineffective therapy while changing to another drug. In order to monitor over time the treatment to targeted therapies, liquid biopsy, that allows the detection in biofluids of either circulating tumor cells (CTCs) or circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) or exosomes, is increasingly employed in clinical trials: with respect to BM the monitoring of both blood and CSF is necessary. Also, radiomics is being developed to predict the mutational status of the BM on MRI. For patients without druggable mutations or who do not respond to targeted agents, immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors is increasingly employed, alone or in combination with radiotherapy. Pseudoprogression after immunotherapy alone maybe a challenge for several months after the start of treatment, and the same is true for radionecrosis after the combination of immunotherapy and SRS. In this regard, the value of advanced MRI techniques and PET imaging for a better distinction of pseudoprogression/radionecrosis and true tumor progression is promising, but needs validation in large prospective datasets. Last, a new frontier in the near future will be chemoprevention (primary and secondary), but we need to identify among solid tumors those subgroups of patients with a higher risk of relapsing into the brain and novel drugs, active on either neoplastic or normal cells of the microenvironment, that are cooperating in the invasion of brain tissue.

AB  - In this national lung cancer audit of inoperable NSCLC patients, acute toxicity and 3-month mortality of curative chemoradiation was analyzed. Another important question was whether concurrent chemoradiation for elderly stage III NSCLC patients is safe. The results showed that 3-month toxicity was significantly higher in patients treated with concurrent chemoradiation, higher TNM stage IIIC and poor performance (WHO >= 2) patients. Introduction: Chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is the standard of care in inoperable non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, favoring concurrent (cCRT) over sequential CRT (seqCRT), with adjuvant immunotherapy in responders. Elderly and frail NSCLC patients have generally been excluded from trials in the past. In elderly patients however, the higher treatment related morbidity of cCRT, may outweigh the possible lower tumor control of seqCRT. For elderly patients with locally advanced NSCLC real-world data is essential to be able to balance treatment toxicity and treatment outcome. The aim of this study is to analyze acute toxicit y and 3-month mortalit y of curative chemoradiation (CRT) in patients with stage III NSCLC and to analyze whether cCRT for elderly stage III NSCLC patients is safe. Methods: The Dutch Lung Cancer Audit-Radiotherapy (DLCA-R) is a national lung cancer audit that started in 2013 for patients treated with curative intent radiotherapy. All Dutch patients treated for stage III NSCLC between 2015 and 2018 with seqCRT or cCRT for (primary or recurrent) stage III lung cancer are included in this population-based study. Information was collected on patient, tumor- and treatment characteristics and the incidence and severity of acute non-hematological toxicity (CTCAE-4 version 4.03) and mortality within 3 months after the end of radiotherapy. To evaluate the association between prognostic factors and outcome (acute toxicity and mortality within 3 months), an univariable and multivariable analysis was performed. The definition of cCRT was:radiotherapy started within 30 days after the start of chemotherapy. Results: Out of all 20 Dutch departments of radiation oncology, 19 centers participated in the registry. A total of 2942 NSCLC stage III patients were treated with CRT. Of these 67.2% (n = 1977) were treated with cCRT (median age 66 years) and 32.8% (n = 965) were treated with seqCRT (median age 69 years). Good performance status (WHO 0-1) was scored in 88.6% for patients treated with cCRT and in 71.0% in the patients treated with seqCRT. Acute nonhema-tological 3-month toxicity (CTCAE grade >3 or radiation pneumonitis grade >2) was scored in 21.9% of the patients treated with cCRT and in 17.7% of the patients treated with seqCRT. The univariable analysis for acute toxicity showed significantly increased toxicity for cCRT (P = .008), WHO >2 (P = .006), and TNM IIIC (P = .031). The multivari-able analysis for acute toxicity was significant for cCRT (P = .015), WHO >2 (P = .001) and TNM IIIC (P = .016). The univariable analysis for 3-month mortality showed significance for seqCRT (P = .025), WHO >2 (P < .001), higher cumulative radiotherapy dose (P < .001), higher gross tumor volume total (P = .020) and male patients (p < .001). None of these variables reached significance in the multivariable analysis for 3-month mortality. Conclusion: In this national lung cancer audit of inoperable NSCLC patients, 3-month toxicity was significantly higher in patients treated with cCRT (21.9% vs.17.7% for seqCRT) higher TNM stage IIIC, and poor performance (WHO >2) patients.The 3-months mortality was not significantly different for tested parameters. Age was not a risk factor for acute toxicity, nor 3 months mortality.

However, thus far, its use has only been established in patients with advanced disease either as first-line therapy in selected patients or following chemotherapy. What is not yet known is how best to incorporate radiation with immunotherapy agents. Many patients with advanced disease can benefit from palliative radiation, but the combination of radiation with immunotherapy has the potential to increase the toxicity of both modalities. Intriguingly, the combination also has the potential to enhance the efficacy of both modalities. For this reason, combining immunotherapy and radiation may help salvage patients with recurrent localized disease who are candidates for re-irradiation. We review the current data evaluating immunotherapy with both palliative radiation as well as definitive re-irradiation in NSCLC.

TI  - Immunotherapy (excluding checkpoint inhibitors) for stage I to III non-small cell lung cancer treated with surgery or radiotherapy with curative intent
T2  - COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - BackgroundNon-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common lung cancer, accounting for approximately 80% to 85% of all cases. For people with localised NSCLC (stages I to III), it has been speculated that immunotherapy may be helpful for reducing postoperative recurrence rates, or improving the clinical outcomes of current treatment for unresectable tumours. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2017 and it includes two new randomised controlled trials (RCTs).ObjectivesTo assess the effectiveness and safety of immunotherapy (excluding checkpoint inhibitors) among people with localised NSCLC of stages I to III who received curative intent of radiotherapy or surgery.Search methodsWe searched the following databases (from inception to 19 May 2021): CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and five trial registers. We also searched conference proceedings and reference lists of included trials.Selection criteriaWe included RCTs conducted in adults (>= 18 years) diagnosed with NSCLC stage I to III after surgical resection, and those with unresectable locally advanced stage III NSCLC receiving radiotherapy with curative intent. We included participants who underwent primary surgical treatment, postoperative radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy if the same strategy was provided for both intervention and control groups.Data collection and analysisTwo review authors independently selected eligible trials, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. We used survival analysis to pool time-to-event data, using hazard ratios (HRs). We used risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous data, and mean differences (MDs) for continuous data, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Due to clinical heterogeneity (immunotherapeutic agents with different underlying mechanisms), we combined data by applying random-effects models.Main resultsWe included 11 RCTs involving 5128 participants (this included 2 new trials with 188 participants since the last search dated 20 January 2017). Participants who underwent surgical resection or received curative radiotherapy were randomised to either an immunotherapy group or a control group. The immunological interventions were active immunotherapy Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) adoptive cell transfer (i.e. transfer factor (TF), tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), dendritic cell/cytokine-induced killer (DC/CIK), antigen-specific cancer vaccines (melanoma-associated antigen 3 (MAGE-A3) and L-BLP25), and targeted natural killer (NK) cells. Seven trials were at high risk of bias for at least one of the risk of bias domains. Three trials were at low risk of bias across all domains and one small trial was at unclear risk of bias as it provided insufficient information. We included data from nine of the 11 trials in the meta-analyses involving 4863 participants.There was no evidence of a difference between the immunotherapy agents and the controls on any of the following outcomes: overall survival (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.05; P = 0.27; 4 trials, 3848 participants; high-quality evidence), progression-free survival (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.03; P = 0.19; moderate-quality evidence), adverse events (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.28; P = 0.11; 4 trials, 4126 evaluated participants; low-quality evidence), and severe adverse events (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.40; 6 trials, 4546 evaluated participants; low-quality evidence).Survival rates at different time points showed no evidence of a diEffrence between immunotherapy agents and the controls. Survival rate at 1-year follow-up (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.08; I-2 = 57%; 7 trials, 4420 participants; low-quality evidence), 2-year follow-up (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.12; 7 trials, 4420 participants; moderate-quality evidence), 3-year follow-up (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.09; 7 trials, 4420 participants; I-2 = 22%; moderate-quality evidence) and at 5-year follow-up (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.12; I-2 = 0%; 7 trials, 4389 participants; moderate-quality evidence).Only one trial reported overall response rates. Two trials provided health-related quality of life results with contradicting results.Authors' conclusionsBased on this updated review, the current literature does not provide evidence that suggests a survival benefit from adding immunotherapy (excluding checkpoint inhibitors) to conventional curative surgery or radiotherapy, for people with localised NSCLC (stages I to III). Several ongoing trials with immune checkpoints inhibitors (PD-1/PD-L1) might bring new insights into the role of immunotherapy for people with stages I to III NSCLC.

TI  - A Review of the Current Approach and Treatment Landscape for Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - The therapeutic landscape of the management of stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has drastically evolved with the incorporation of immunotherapy and targeted therapy. Stage III NSCLC accounts for one-third of the cases and the treatment strategy of these locally advanced presentations are diverse, ranging from surgical to non-surgical options; with the incorporation of chemo-immunotherapy, radiation, and targeted therapies wherever applicable. The staging of this disease has also changed, and it is essential to have a strong multidisciplinary approach to do justice to patient care. In this article, we aim to navigate the nuanced approaches in the diagnosis and treatment of stage III NSCLC and expand on the evolution of the management of this disease.

TI  - Extensive-stage small cell lung cancer: Is prophylactic cranial irradiation necessary in the era of immunotherapy with MRI surveillance?
T2  - PRECISION RADIATION ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveThe role of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in treating extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) has been controversial. This study aimed to comprehensively analyze the efficacy of PCI for the treatment of ES-SCLC under active brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) surveillance.MethodsPatients with ES-SCLC with no brain metastases (BM) confirmed by MRI at the time of diagnosis who responded well to first-line chemoimmunotherapy at three general hospitals were retrospectively included. Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and cumulative incidence of BM were compared between patients who underwent PCI and those who did not.ResultsIn total, 66 consecutive patients treated between March 2019 and December 2021 were included in our dataset. Seventeen patients underwent PCI (PCI group) and 49 patients did not (non-PCI group). In comparison with the non-PCI group, PCI did not provide OS (median OS: 18.53 vs. 17.35 months, p = 0.28) or PFS (median PFS: 8.61 vs. 7.56 months, p = 0.41) benefits. When death was counted as a competing risk, the difference in the cumulative incidence rate of BM was not statistically significant (1-year: 12.79% vs. 38.09%; p = 0.14).ConclusionCompared to active MRI surveillance, first-line chemoimmunotherapy followed by PCI did not improve the prognosis of patients with ES-SCLC. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the therapeutic effects of PCI following chemoimmunotherapy.In the modern era of immunotherapy prolonging overall survival and increasing routine use of surveillance MRI, the use of prophylactic cranial irradiation after first-line chemotherapy and immunotherapy was not associated with an overall survival benefit or a progression-free survival benefit for patients with extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer. The use of prophylactic cranial irradiation was also not associated with a decrease in the risk of developing new brain metastases. image

TI  - Stereotactic radiosurgery with and without checkpoint inhibition for patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer to the brain: a matched cohort study
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) improve survival in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Clinical trials examining the efficacy of ICIs in patients with NSCLC excluded patients with untreated brain metastases (BMs). As stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is commonly employed for NSCLC-BMs, the authors sought to define the safety and radiological and clinical outcomes for patients with NSCLC-BMs treated with concurrent ICI and SRS.METHODS A retrospective matched cohort study was performed on patients who had undergone SRS for one or more NSCLC-derived BMs. Two matched cohorts were identified: one that received ICI before or after SRS within a 3-month period (concurrent ICI) and one that did not (ICI naive). Locoregional tumor control, peritumoral edema, and central nervous system (CNS) adverse events were compared between the two cohorts.RESULTS Seventeen patients (45 BMs) and 34 patients (92 BMs) composed the concurrent-ICI and ICI-naive cohorts, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in overall survival (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.39-2.52, p = 0.99) or CNS progression-free survival (HR 2.18, 95% CI 0.72-6.62, p = 0.11) between the two groups. Similarly, the 12-month local tumor control rate was 84.9% for tumors in the concurrent-ICI cohort versus 76.3% for tumors in the ICI-naive cohort (p = 0.94). Further analysis did reveal that patients receiving concurrent ICI had increased rates of CNS complete response for BMs treated with SRS (8/16 [50%] vs 5/32 [15.6%], p = 0.012) per the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria. There was also a shorter median time to BM regression in the concurrent-ICI cohort (2.5 vs 3.1 months, p < 0.0001). There was no increased rate of radiation necrosis or intratumoral hemorrhage in the patients receiving concurrent ICI (5.9% vs 2.9% in ICI-naive cohort, p = 0.99). There was no significant difference in the rate of peritumoral edema progression between the two groups (concurrent ICI: 11.1%, ICI naive: 21.7%, p = 0.162).CONCLUSIONS The concurrent use of ICI and SRS to treat NSCLC-BM was well tolerated while providing more rapid BM regression. Concurrent ICI did not increase peritumoral edema or rates of radiation necrosis. Further studies are needed to evaluate whether combined ICI and SRS improves progression-free survival and overall survival for patients with metastatic NSCLC.

TI  - TENERGY: multicenter phase II study of Atezolizumab monotherapy following definitive Chemoradiotherapy with 5-FU plus Cisplatin in patients with unresectable locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma
T2  - BMC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The standard treatment for patients with unresectable locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT) using 5-FU plus cisplatin. However, complete response (CR) rates are low at 11-25%, resulting in 9-10 months of median overall survival (OS). An improved therapeutic efficacy by combining immunotherapy with radiation has been reported in patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer. The results using ESCC cell lines suggest sequential treatment with anti-PD-L1 agents soon after completion of CRT is the most effective combination. Methods TENERGY trial is a multicenter, phase II, proof-of-concept study to assess the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab following definitive CRT in patients with locally advanced ESCC. The main inclusion criteria are unresectable locally advanced ESCC without distant metastasis, completion of 60 Gy of radiation plus two concomitant cycles of chemotherapy (cisplatin 70 mg/m(2) on day 1 and 5-FU 700 mg/m(2) on days 1-4, every 28 days), and adequate organ function. Within 6 weeks after CRT, participants will start taking 1200 mg of atezolizumab every three weeks and continue until 12 months or disease progression. The primary endpoint is the confirmed CR rate by the investigator's assessment. Secondary endpoints include overall response rate, progression-free survival (PFS), OS, adverse events, and confirmed CR rate by central assessment. We will enroll 50 patients (40 with primary locally advanced ESCC and 10 with postoperative locoregionally recurrent ESCC). We will obtain biopsies from the primary site and will collect blood at 3 time points (before CRT, after CRT, and four weeks after the start of atezolizumab) for an exploratory biomarker study. We will analyze the phenotype of immune-competent cells, neoantigens, tumor mutational burden, PD-L1 status, and Human Leukocyte Antigen haplotyping. Discussion The synergistic efficacies of the sequential combination of CRT and atezolizumab should improve the CR rate, resulting in survival improvement for patients with unresectable locally advanced ESCC. Because CRT is a standard treatment option for patients with early stage to locally advanced ESCC, the sequential combination of CRT and atezolizumab has the potential to change the standard ESCC treatments.

TI  - The role of radiotherapy in extensive-stage small cell lung cancer after durvalumab-based immunochemotherapy: A retrospective study.
T2  - Chinese medical journal
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of subsequent radiotherapy (RT) following first-line treatment with durvalumab plus chemotherapy in patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC).METHODS: A total of 122 patients with ES-SCLC from three hospitals during July 2019 to December 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) analysis was performed to address potential confounding factors. The primary focus of our evaluation was to assess the impact of RT on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).RESULTS: After IPTW analysis, 49 patients received durvalumab plus platinum-etoposide(EP) chemotherapy followed by RT (Durva+EP+RT) and 72 patients received immunochemotherapy (Durva+EP). The median OS was 17.2months vs. 12.3months (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.38, 95% CI: 0.17-0.85, P=0.020), and the median PFS was 8.9months vs. 5.9months (HR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.32-0.97, P=0.030) in Durva+EP+RT and Durva+EP groups, respectively. Thoracic radiation therapy (TRT) resulted in longer OS (17.2months vs. 14.7months) and PFS (9.1months vs. 7.2months) compared to RT directed to other metastatic sites. Among patients with oligo-metastasis, RT also showed significant benefits, with a median OS of 17.4months vs. 13.7months and median PFS of 9.8months vs. 5.9months compared to no RT. Continuous durvalumab treatment beyond progression (TBP) prolonged OS compared to patients without TBP, in both the Durva+EP+RT (NA vs. 15.8months, HR: 0.48, 95% CI: 0.14-1.63, P=0.238) and Durva+EP groups (12.3months vs. 4.3months, HR: 0.29, 95% CI: 0.10-0.81, P=0.018). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in 13 (26.5%) and 13 (18.1%) patients, respectively, in the two groups; pneumonitis was mostly low-grade.CONCLUSION: Addition of RT after first-line immunochemotherapy significantly improved survival outcomes with manageable toxicity in ES-SCLC.

T2  - Revue des maladies respiratoires
M3  - English Abstract
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Nowadays, biological cancer treatments represent the major advance in non-small cell lung cancer therapeutic strategies. During the last decade, more than 15 randomized trials associating chemo with biological treatments, in first line setting, have included more than 12,073 NSCLC patients, and as much in phase 2-3 trials in second and third line setting. Very few were positive, but currently anti-angiogenic strategy using the humanized monoclonal antibody bevacizumab has been approved in association with chemotherapy, in first line treatment of carefully selected NSCLC patients (with non proximal tumors, without cerebral metastasis, and of non-squamous histology). On the same way, monotherapy by the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib has been approved in second and third line setting, with comparable results as chemotherapy. 2008 was the year of new targeted therapies with cetuximab, the chimeric monoclonal antibody directed against EFGR, in association with chemotherapy in first line setting, whereas EGFR TKI are also tested in first line, in patients selected on the ground of the molecular properties of their tumors (with EGFR mutation or positive EGFR FISH). New generation EGFR TKI (more potent if not more selective) are developed in new settings (neo-adjuvant or adjuvant treatment), with promising results in phase 2 trials, whereas active immunotherapy directed toward MUC1 or MAGE-A3 are tested in large phase 3 randomized trials in adjuvant setting (post-surgery or post-radiotherapy), since phase 2 results were appealing. Therefore, during the last few years, targeted therapies quit science-fiction to enter in our current practice, leading clinicians to learn how to treat new kinds of toxicities and to select patients on molecular grounds.

TI  - Radiomics approaches to predict PD-L1 and PFS in advanced non-small cell lung patients treated with immunotherapy: a multi-institutional study
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the increasing use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), there is an urgent need to identify biomarkers to stratify responders and non-responders using programmed death-ligand (PD-L1) expression, and to predict patient-specific outcomes such as progression free survival (PFS). The current study is aimed to determine the feasibility of building imaging-based predictive biomarkers for PD-L1 and PFS through systematically evaluating a combination of several machine learning algorithms with different feature selection methods. A retrospective, multicenter study of 385 advanced NSCLC patients amenable to ICIs was undertaken in two academic centers. Radiomic features extracted from pretreatment CT scans were used to build predictive models for PD-L1 and PFS (short-term vs. long-term survivors). We first employed the LASSO methodology followed by five feature selection methods and seven machine learning approaches to build the predictors. From our analyses, we found several combinations of feature selection methods and machine learning algorithms to achieve a similar performance. Logistic regression with ReliefF feature selection (AUC = 0.64, 0.59 in discovery and validation cohorts) and SVM with Anova F-test feature selection (AUC = 0.64, 0.63 in discovery and validation datasets) were the best-performing models to predict PD-L1 and PFS. This study elucidates the application of suitable feature selection approaches and machine learning algorithms to predict clinical endpoints using radiomics features. Through this study, we identified a subset of algorithms that should be considered in future investigations for building robust and clinically relevant predictive models.

TI  - First exploration of the on-treatment changes in tumor and organ uptake of a radiolabeled anti PD-L1 antibody during chemoradiotherapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer using whole body PET
T2  - JOURNAL FOR IMMUNOTHERAPY OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background In patients with locally advanced unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), durvalumab, an anti-programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) antibody, has shown improved overall survival when used as consolidation therapy following concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT). However, it is unclear whether CRT itself upregulates PD-L1 expression. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the changes in the uptake of the anti PD-L1 antibody [89Zr]Zr-durvalumab in tumors and healthy organs during CRT in patients with NSCLC.Methods Patients with NSCLC scheduled to undergo CRT were scanned 7 +/- 1 days after administration of 37 +/- 1 MBq [89Zr]Zr-durvalumab at baseline, 1-week on-treatment and 1 week after finishing 6 weeks of CRT. First, [89Zr]Zr-durvalumab uptake was visually assessed in a low dose cohort with a mass dose of 2 mg durvalumab (0.13% of therapeutic dose) and subsequently, quantification was done in a high dose cohort with a mass dose of 22.5 mg durvalumab (1.5% of therapeutic dose). Tracer pharmacokinetics between injections were compared using venous blood samples drawn in the 22.5 mg cohort. Visual assessment included suspected lesion detectability. Positron emission tomography (PET) uptake in tumoral and healthy tissues was quantified using tumor to plasma ratio (TPR) and organ to plasma ratio, respectively.Results In the 2 mg dose cohort, 88% of the 17 identified tumor lesions were positive at baseline, compared with 69% (9/13) for the 22.5 mg cohort. Although the absolute plasma concentrations between patients varied, the intrapatient variability was low. The ten quantitatively assessed lesions in the 22.5 mg cohort had a median TPR at baseline of 1.3 (IQR 0.7-1.5), on-treatment of 1.0 (IQR 0.7-1.4) and at the end of treatment of 0.7 (IQR 0.6-0.7). On-treatment, an increased uptake in bone marrow was seen in three out of five patients together with a decreased uptake in the spleen in four out of five patients.Conclusions This study successfully imaged patients with NSCLC with [89Zr]Zr-durvalumab PET before and during CRT. Our data did not show any increase in [89Zr]Zr-durvalumab uptake in the tumor 1-week on-treatment and at the end of treatment. The changes observed in bone marrow and spleen may be due to an CRT-induced effect on immune cells.Trial registration number EudraCT number: 2019-004284-51

TI  - PCSK9 regulates the efficacy of immune checkpoint therapy in lung cancer
T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) secreted by tumors was reported as a deleterious factor that led to the reduction of lymphocyte infiltration and the poorer efficacy of ICIs in vivo. This study aimed to explore whether PCSK9 expression in tumor tissue could predict the response of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy and the synergistic antitumor effect of the combination of the PCSK9 inhibitor with the anti-CD137 agonist. One hundred fifteen advanced NSCLC patients who received anti-PD-1 immunotherapy were retrospectively studied with PCSK9 expression in baseline NSCLC tissues detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The mPFS of the PCSK9(lo) group was significantly longer than that of the PCSK9(hi) group [8.1 vs. 3.6 months, hazard ratio (HR): 3.450; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.166-5.496]. A higher objective response rate (ORR) and a higher disease control rate (DCR) were observed in the PCSK9(lo) group than in the PCSK9(hi) group (54.4% vs. 34.5%, 94.7% vs. 65.5%). Reduction and marginal distribution of CD8(+) T cells were observed in PCSK9(hi) NSCLC tissues. Tumor growth was retarded by the PCSK9 inhibitor and the anti-CD137 agonist alone in the Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) mice model and further retarded by the PCSK9 inhibitor in combination with the CD137 agonist with long-term survival of the host mice with noticeable increases of CD8(+) and GzmB(+) CD8(+) T cells and reduction of Tregs. Together, these results suggested that high PCSK9 expression in baseline tumor tissue was a deleterious factor for the efficacy of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in advanced NSCLC patients. The PCSK9 inhibitor in combination with the anti-CD137 agonist could not only enhance the recruitment of CD8(+) and GzmB(+) CD8(+) T cells but also deplete Tregs, which may be a novel therapeutic strategy for future research and clinical practice.

TI  - Adjuvant and inductive systemic treatment in non-small cell lung cancer
T2  - CHIRURG
M3  - Article
AB  - A large number of randomized trials have demonstrated an undoubted advantage of adjuvant chemotherapy in comparison to surgery alone. This is true for all lymph node positive cases of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with a tumor size of 4 cm or more. Worldwide, the application of adjuvant chemotherapy for these indications is regarded as standard treatment. Due to the positive results of adjuvant chemotherapy, nearly all studies focusing on neoadjuvant chemotherapy were stopped early because control arms with surgery alone were no longer regarded as ethically justified; however, in meta-analyses the effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy seems be as strong as the effect of adjuvant chemotherapy. In clinical practice neoadjuvant chemotherapy is not routinely established in early stage disease. This approach is more often applied in advanced stages, such as N2 lymph node involvement or in patients where the tumor most probably requires pneumectomy for resection. In the last decade the options for systemic treatment of NSCLC have dramatically changed. In addition to chemotherapy, targeted treatment of patients with molecularly altered tumors and immunotherapy have been used very successfully in advanced stages. The options might also have a high impact on survival in early stages and the integration of these treatment modalities in the management of early stage disease is warranted. This article summarizes the established and new options in additive systemic treatment and presents the current state of treatment.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THORACIC DISEASE
M3  - Review
AB  - Lung cancer is the most common cancer worldwide. Approximately 18% of all deaths related to cancer are associated with lung cancer. Management of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has been changing rapidly in last few years. For patients with unresectable non-metastatic disease, maintenance durvalumab is now given after offering chemo-radiation concurrently based on the result from the PACIFIC trial. Management of metastatic disease greatly depends on the status of sensitizing driver mutation and PD L1 level of the tumor cells. In this review article, we will summarize the outcome of various clinical trials and will provide the most up-to-date information on the management of patients with advanced and metastatic NSCLC.

TI  - CRACD-controlled cell plasticity and small cell lung cancer
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACTSmall cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an extremely deadly cancer, and current chemo/radiation therapies lack durableeffects. Immunotherapy with immune checkpoint blockades is effective for only ~13% of SCLC patients andrarely results in sustained responses in extensive-stage SCLC. Targeted therapy development for SCLC ischallenging as SCLC tumors typically have few actionable drivers but instead are mainly driven by loss-of-function mutations in RB1 and TP53 (>90%) and frequent loss and inactivation of other potential tumorsuppressors, including a set of epigenetic regulators. Nevertheless, recent discoveries from SCLC genomicsprovide a new framework for understanding the biology of SCLC and identifying the molecular vulnerabilities ofthe disease. Functional characterization of the recurrent mutations in putative tumor suppressor genes is crucialfor defining the mechanisms of tumorigenesis, which will facilitate the discovery of biomarkers for tumorprevention and intervention. We recently identified a new tumor suppressor gene, CRACD (Capping proteininhibiting Regulator of ACtin Dynamics; KIAA1211/CRAD). CRACD encodes a protein that binds to and inhibitsthe capping proteins, thereby facilitating actin polymerization. CRACD is frequently mutated or transcriptionallydownregulated in SCLC patient tumors. Cracd knockout (KO) promotes the transformation of preneoplasticprecursor lung epithelial cells. Cracd KO also significantly accelerates SCLC development in an autochthonousmouse model in which tumor initiation is induced by the deletion of Rb1, Trp53, and Rbl2 triple KO mousemodels. Cracd KO SCLC tumors harbor distinct root cell clusters with aberrant cell lineage trajectories andimpaired antigen presentation. Single-cell transcriptome analysis has further stratified SCLC patients by CRACDinactivation and antigen presentation pathway impairment. Intriguingly, ablation of Cracd alone induceshyperplasia of neuroendocrine cells and aberrant cell lineage plasticity in the mouse lung. These results led tothe hypothesis that CRACD inactivation induces aberrant neuroendocrine cell plasticity to initiate and promoteSCLC tumorigenesis via dysregulated nuclear actin dynamics and subsequent epigenetic reprogramming. Theproposed study will unveil the biology of SCLC initiation and progression and determine the cells-of-origin andtheir relevant cell lineages inducing neuroendocrine cell plasticity, providing novel insight into SCLCtumorigenesis. Additionally, this study will establish a new model system for SCLC initiation and progression andintroduce a novel somatic engineering system, which is technologically innovative. Completing this study willalso lay a solid foundation to determine whether CRACD loss is a molecular signature for specific SCLC patientstratification and immunotherapy response prediction, which will be conceptually and clinically innovative.

TI  - A phase II study of weekly carboplatin and concurrent radiotherapy in older adults with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LOGIK1902)
T2  - THORACIC CANCER
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Background: Concurrent chemoradiotherapy is the standard therapy for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, there is little evidence supporting its use in older adults. Low-dose daily carboplatin combined with thoracic radiotherapy is considered a standard regimen for this population. To establish a simple and feasible carboplatin administration method, we conducted a study of weekly carboplatin and concurrent radiotherapy for older adults with locally advanced NSCLC. Methods: This prospective, single-arm, multicenter, phase II clinical trial included patients aged >= 75 years with unresectable stage III NSCLC and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-1. Patients received chemoradiotherapy (60 Gy/30 fractions plus concurrent weekly carboplatin at an area under curve of 2 mg mL(-1) min(-1)). The primary endpoint was the overall response rate (ORR). Key secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety. Results: From July 2020 to June 2022, 37 patients were enrolled from 15 institutions, and 36 patients were evaluable for efficacy and safety. The ORR was 63.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 47.6-77.5). Median PFS was 14.6 months (95% CI = 9.1-18.1). Median OS was 25.5 months (95% CI = 17.4-not reached). Grade 4 leucopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia were observed in one patient (2.8%) each. Conclusion: Weekly carboplatin and concurrent radiation therapy was safe in older adults with locally advanced NSCLC, and promising activity was observed.

TI  - PACIFIC: shifting tides in the treatment of locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL LUNG CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - The treatment paradigm of stage III, unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has had few advancement since concurrent chemoradiotherapy was established as standard of care treatment. Despite modifications to radiotherapy, chemotherapy and surgical approaches, loco-regional and distant relapse remain high, which unfortunately has translated to poor survival outcomes. The PACIFIC study introduced immunotherapy to the domain of stage III NSCLC and has emerged as the fourth pillar in cancer treatment for these patients. The positive results of the study have excited both the radiation and medical oncology communities, demonstrating improvements in overall and progression-free survival (PFS). In this review, we discuss the details and impacts of the PACIFIC study, as well as the future implications for the treatment of stage III NSCLC.

TI  - Vaccination approach to anti-angiogenic treatment of cancer
T2  - BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-REVIEWS ON CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - Improvement of patient survival by anti-angiogenic therapy has proven limited. A vaccination approach inducing an immune response against the tumor vasculature combines the benefits of immunotherapy and anti-angiogenesis, and may overcome the limitations of current anti-angiogenic drugs. Strategies to use whole endo: thelial cell vaccines and DNA- or protein vaccines against key players in the VEGF signaling axis, as well as specific markers of tumor endothelial cells, have been tested in preclinical studies. Current clinical trials are now testing the promise of this specific anti-cancer vaccination approach. This review will highlight the state-of-the-art in this exciting field of cancer research.

TI  - Survival outcomes and toxicity of adjuvant immunotherapy after definitive concurrent chemotherapy with proton beam radiation therapy for patients with inoperable locally advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma
T2  - RADIOTHERAPY AND ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Adjuvant immunotherapy (IO) following concurrent chemotherapy and photon radiation therapy confers an overall survival (OS) benefit for patients with inoperable locally advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma (LA-NSCLC); however, outcomes of adjuvant IO after concurrent chemotherapy with proton beam therapy (CPBT) are unknown. We investigated OS and toxicity after CPBT with adjuvant IO versus CPBT alone for inoperable LA-NSCLC. Materials and methods: We analyzed 354 patients with LA-NSCLC who were prospectively treated with CPBT with or without adjuvant IO from 2009 to 2021. Optimal variable ratio propensity score matching (PSM) matched CPBT with CPBT + IO patients. Survival was estimated with the Kaplan -Meier method and compared with log -rank tests. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression evaluated the effect of IO on disease outcomes. Results: Median age was 70 years; 71 (20%) received CPBT + IO and 283 (80%) received CPBT only. After PSM, 71 CPBT patients were matched with 71 CPBT + IO patients. Three-year survival rates for CPBT + IO vs CPBT were: OS 67% vs 30% (P < 0.001) and PFS 59% vs 35% (P = 0.017). Three-year LRFS (P = 0.137) and DMFS (P = 0.086) did not differ. Receipt of adjuvant IO was a strong predictor of OS (HR 0.40, P = 0.001) and PFS (HR 0.56, P = 0.030), but not LRFS (HR 0.61, P = 0.121) or DMFS (HR 0.61, P = 0.136). There was an increased incidence of grade >= 3 esophagitis in the CPBT-only group (6% CPBT + IO vs 17% CPBT, P = 0.037). Conclusion: This study, one of the first to investigate CPBT followed by IO for inoperable LA-NSCLC, showed that IO conferred survival benefits with no increased rates of toxicity.

TI  - Four-Year Survival With Durvalumab After Chemoradiotherapy in Stage III NSCLC-an Update From the PACIFIC Trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF THORACIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: In the Phase 3, placebo-controlled PACIFIC trial of patients with unresectable, stage III NSCLC without disease progression after concurrent chemoradiotherapy, consolidative durvalumab was associated with significant improvements in the primary end points of overall survival (OS) (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.68; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.53-0.87; p = 0.00251; data cutoff, March 22, 2018) and progression-free survival (PFS) (blinded independent central review; Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1) (HR = 0.52; 95% CI: 0.42-65; p < 0.0001; February 13, 2017) with manageable safety. Here, we report updated analyses of OS and PFS, approximately 4 years after the last patient was randomized.Methods: Patients with WHO performance status of 0 or 1 (and any tumor programmed death-ligand 1 status) were randomized (2:1) to intravenous durvalumab (10 mg/kg) or placebo, administered every 2 weeks (<= 12 months), stratified by age, sex, and smoking history. OS and PFS were analyzed using a stratified log-rank test in the intent-to-treat population. Medians and 4-year OS and PFS rates were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method.Results: Overall, 709 of 713 randomized patients received durvalumab (n/N=473/476) or placebo (n/N=236/237). As of March 20, 2020 (median follow-up = 34.2 months; range: 0.2-64.9), updated OS (HR = 0.71; 95% CI: 0.57-0.88) and PFS (HR = 0.55; 95% CI: 0.44-0.67) remained consistent with the primary analyses. The median OS for durvalumab was reached (47.5 mo; placebo, 29.1 months). Estimated 4-year OS rates were 49.6% versus 36.3% for durvalumab versus placebo, and 4-year PFS rates were 35.3% versus 19.5% respectively.Conclusion: These updated exploratory analyses demonstrate durable PFS and sustained OS benefit with durvalumab after chemoradiotherapy. An estimated 49.6% of patients randomized to durvalumab remain alive at 4 years (placebo, 36.3%), and 35.3% remain alive and progression-free (placebo, 19.5%).

T2  - THERAPEUTIC ADVANCES IN MEDICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - According to recent analyses, there was a modest yet significant improvement in median survival time and 5-year survival rate of limited stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC) in North America, Europe, Japan and other countries over the last 30 years. The median survival time of limited stage SCLC is 15-20 months and 5-year survival rate is 15% or less. In terms of extensive stage SCLC, a median survival time of 9.4-12.8 months and 2-year survival of 5.2-19.5% are still disappointing. Despite being highly sensitive to first-line chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatments, most patients with SCLC experience relapse within 2 years and die from systemic metastasis. While several clinical trials of cytotoxic chemotherapies and molecular targeting agents have been investigated in the treatment of relapsed SCLC, none showed a significant clinical activity to be able to exceed topotecan as second-line chemotherapy. There are problematic issues to address for relapsed SCLC, such as standardizing the treatment for third-line chemotherapy. Topotecan alone was the first approved therapy for second-line treatment for relapsed SCLC. Amrubicin is a promising drug and a variety of trials evaluating its efficacy have been carried out. Amrubicin has shown superiority to topotecan in a Japanese population, but was not superior in a study of western patients. There are some controversial issues for relapsed SCLC, such as treatment for older patients, third-line chemotherapy and efficacy of molecular targeting therapy. This article reviews current standard treatment, recent clinical trials and other topics on relapsed SCLC.

TI  - Dynamic evaluation of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio as prognostic factor in stage III non-small cell lung cancer treated with chemoradiotherapy
T2  - CLINICAL & TRANSLATIONAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC) is frequently treated with chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Despite the efforts, long-term outcomes are poor, and novel therapies have been introduced to improve results. Biomarkers are needed to detect early treatment failure and plan future follow-up and therapies. Our aim is to evaluate the role of dynamics of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in patients with locally advanced NSCLC treated with CRT. Methods We retrospectively reviewed patients diagnosed with LA-NSCLC receiving definitive CRT at our center from 2010 to 2015. Baseline and post-treatment NLR were collected from our center database. NLR was dichotomized (threshold = 4) and patients were divided into two groups based on the variation from baseline to post-treatment NLR. The prognostic role and association with response were examined with logistic regression and multivariate Cox regression model, respectively. Results Ninety-two patients were included. Our analysis shows that NLR after treatment is associated with response to treatment [OR in the multivariate analysis 4.94 (1.01-24.48); p value = 0.048]. Furthermore, NLR and ECOG are independent prognostic factors for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Specifically, PFS was 25.79 months for the good prognosis group and 12.09 for the poor prognosis group [HR 2.98 (CI 95% = 1.74-5.10), p < 0.001]; and OS was 42.94 months and 18.86 months, respectively [HR 2.81 (CI 95% = 1.62-4.90), p < 0.001]. Conclusion Dynamics of NLR have a prognostic value in stage III NSCLC treated with definitive CRT. Pre- and post-CRT NLR should be evaluated in prospective clinical trials involving consolidation treatment with immunotherapy.

TI  - GEMSTONE-301: a phase III clinical trial of CS1001 as consolidation therapy in patients with locally advanced/unresectable (stage III) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who did not have disease progression after prior concurrent/sequential chemoradiotherapy
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL LUNG CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: In China, platinum-based doublet chemotherapy is the standard treatment for patients who have unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), administered with radiotherapy on either a concurrent or sequential basis. However, NSCLC patients who undergo this treatment can expect poor median progression-free survival (PFS) of around 8-10 months and a dismal 5-year overall survival (OS) rate of about 15%. In the recent PACIFIC trial, durvalumab was demonstrated to hold significant clinical benefit for patients with locally advanced/unresectable NSCLC who experienced no disease progression after definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy (cCRT). CS1001 is the first full-length, fully human immunoglobin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody (mAb) that targets programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) created through the OMT transgenic rat platform. The phase Ia/Ib study indicated CS1001 was well tolerated and exhibited anti-tumor potential with a range of tumors. GEMSTONE-301 is a phase III randomized, double-blind, study to explore the efficacy and safety of CS1001 compared with a placebo as consolidation therapy for stage III unresectable NSCLC patients.Methods: In this trial, eligible patients will be randomized to receive CS1001 1,200 mg or placebo, every 3 weeks (Q3W). The primary endpoint will be investigator-assessed PFS, based on the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. The secondary endpoints will include OS, PFS assessment based on Blinded Independent Center Review (BICR), objective response rate (ORR), other efficacy measurements, safety, and tolerability.Discussion: This phase III trial will determine the efficacy and safety of CS1001 as consolidation therapy in patients with locally advanced/unresectable (stage III) NSCLC who did not have disease progression after prior concurrent/sequential chemoradiotherapy (cCRT or sCRT), and is the first phase III trial on an antiPD-L1 mAb initiated in China for this indication.

TI  - State-of-the-art combination treatment strategies for advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most abundant type of epithelial lung cancer being diagnosed after 40% of invasions of excrescence in pulmonary tissues. According to WHO, 30% of NSCLC patients can be cured if diagnosed and treated early. Mutations play an important role in advanced stage NSCLC treatment, which includes critical proteins necessary for cellular growth and replication. Restricting such mutations may improve survival in lung cancer patients. Newer technologies include endoscopic bronchial ultrasonography and esophageal ultrasonography. Currently, policymaking or decision-making for treatment regimens merely depends on the genomic alterations and mutations. DNA sequencing, methylation, protein, and fragmented DNA analysis do NSCLC screening. Achievement of these goals requires consideration of available therapeutics in current anticancer approaches for improving quality of life and treatment outcomes for NSCLC patient. The specific goals of this review are to discuss first-line and second-line therapies for advanced-stage NSCLC and molecularly targeted therapy including thoughtful discussion on precise role of treatment strategies in specific tumors. Also, concerned diagnostics, new clinical trial designs, and pursuing appropriate combinations of radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy with biological therapy for exceptional cases considering resistance mechanisms and palliative care will be discussed.

TI  - Current status of clinical trial research and application of immune checkpoint inhibitors for non-small cell lung cancer
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Immunotherapy has emerged as a hot topic in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with remarkable success. Compared to chemotherapy patients, the 5-year survival rate for immunotherapy patients is 3-fold higher, approximately 4%-5% versus 15%-16%, respectively. Immunotherapies include chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy, tumor vaccines, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and so forth. Among them, immune checkpoint inhibitors are in the spotlight. Common immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) currently in clinical use include programmed death receptor-1(PD-1)/programmed death ligand-1(PD-L1) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4(CTLA-4). This article focuses on monotherapy and combination therapy of CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors. In particular, the combination therapy of ICIs includes the combination of ICIs and chemotherapy, the combination therapy of dual ICIs, the combination of ICIs and anti-angiogenic drugs, the combination of ICIs and radiotherapy, and the combination of ICIs inhibitors and tumor vaccines and so forth. This article focuses on the combination therapy of ICIs with chemotherapy, the combination therapy of dual ICIs, and the combination therapy of ICIs with anti-angiogenic drugs. The efficacy and safety of ICIs as single agents in NSCLC have been demonstrated in many trials. However, ICIs plus chemotherapy regimens offer significant advantages in the treatment of NSCLC with little to no dramatic increase in toxicity, while combined dual ICIs significantly reduce the adverse effects (AEs) of chemotherapy. ICIs plus anti-angiogenic agents regimen improves anti-tumor activity and safety and is expected to be the new paradigm for the treatment of advanced NSCLC. Despite some limitations, these agents have achieved better overall survival rates. In this article, we review the current status and progress of research on ICIs in NSCLC in recent years, aiming to better guide the individualized treatment of NSCLC patients.

TI  - Role of Surgical Pathologist for the Detection of Immuno-oncologic Predictive Factors in Non-small Cell Lung Cancers
T2  - ADVANCES IN ANATOMIC PATHOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Until very recently, surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy have been the mainstay of treatment in non-small cell carcinomas (NSCLCs). However, recent advances in molecular immunology have unveiled some of the complexity of the mechanisms regulating cellular immune responses and led to the successful targeting of immune checkpoints in attempts to enhance antitumor T-cell responses. Immune checkpoint molecules such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein-4, programmed cell death protein-1, and programmed death ligand (PD-L) 1 have been shown to play central roles in evading cancer immunity. Thus, these molecules have been targeted by inhibitors for the management of cancers forming the basis of immunotherapy. Advanced NSCLC has been the paradigm for the benefits of immunotherapy in any cancer. Treatment decisions are made based on the expression of PD-L1 on the tumor cells and the presence or absence of driver mutations. Patients with high PD-L1 expression (= 50%) and no driver mutations are treated with single-agent immunotherapy whereas, for all other patients with a lower level of PD-L1 expression, a combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy is preferred. Thus, PD-L1 blockers are the only immunotherapeutic agents approved in advanced NSCLC without any oncogenic driver mutations. PD-L1 immunohistochemistry, however, may not be the best biomarker in view of its dynamic nature in time and space, and the benefits may be seen regardless of PD -L1 expression. Each immunotherapy molecule is prescribed based on the levels of PD-L1 expression as assessed by a Food and Drug Administration-approved companion diagnostic assay. Other biomarkers that have been studied include tumor mutational burden, the T-effector signature, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, radiomic assays, inflammation index, presence or absence of immune-related adverse events and specific driver mutations, and gut as well as local microbiome. At the current time, none of these biomarkers are routinely used in the clinical decision-making process for immunotherapy in NSCLC. However, in individual cases, they can be useful adjuncts to conventional therapy. This review describes our current understanding of the role of biomarkers as predictors of response to immune checkpoint molecules. To begin with a brief on cancer immunology in general and in NSCLC, in particular, is discussed. In the end, recent advancements in laboratory techniques for refining biomarker assays are described.

TI  - Durvalumab in NSCLC: latest evidence and clinical potential
T2  - THERAPEUTIC ADVANCES IN MEDICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Advances in immunotherapy have led to radical improvements in outcomes, including overall survival, such as in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with metastatic disease treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors. More recently, promising results have been obtained in earlier disease settings, and combinations with other therapies are being actively investigated. Durvalumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against the programmed death ligand 1, has demonstrated significant activity in NSCLC, including increased progression-free survival rates after chemoradiation for unresectable stage III disease, with a favourable safety profile. Clinical trials, including phase III studies, are ongoing as monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy, radiotherapy and other immunotherapies, such as the anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 drug tremelimumab, in diverse stages of the disease.

TI  - Factors associated with failure to start consolidation durvalumab after definitive chemoradiation for locally advanced NSCLC
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionThe introduction of consolidation immunotherapy after chemoradiotherapy has improved outcome for patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer. However, not all patients receive this treatment. This study identifies factors associated with failure to start durvalumab as consolidation therapy with the aim of optimizing treatment, supportive care and prehabilitation to ensure that more patients complete the planned treatment. Materials and methodsPatients from two clinical trials and a named patient use program, were included in this study. All patients received platinum-doublet chemotherapy concomitant with radiotherapy to a total dose of 60-66 gray. Patient characteristics, cancer treatment, toxicity, performance status and laboratory data before and after chemoradiotherapy were recorded and patients who never started durvalumab were compared with those who did. ResultsA total of 101 patients were included, of which 83 started treatments with durvalumab after chemoradiotherapy. The 18 patients who did not start durvalumab had significantly higher lactate dehydrogenase at baseline and a worse performance status, cumulative toxicity and higher c-reactive protein after completed chemoradiotherapy. Data also suggest that pre-treatment diabetes and reduced hemoglobin and/or diffusion capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide contribute to the risk of treatment abruption. ConclusionTreatment plan disruption rate was 18%. Systemic inflammation and performance status were associated with failure to receive durvalumab after chemoradiation. Further studies are needed to confirm findings and prospective trials should investigate whether prehabilitation and supportive treatment could help more patients finishing the planned treatment.

AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common malignancy and the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death all over the world. Traditional treatments, including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery and targeted therapy, form the backbone of current treatment in various stages of CRC, but the efficacy in patients with recurrent or metastatic disease is extremely poor. Recently-developed immunotherapy is frequently used in various cancers with high malignancy, such as leukemia, melanoma and non-small-cell lung cancer, and achieves promising clinical outcomes. Immunotherapy has been also investigated in CRC, but the outcome is so disappointed in majority of patients, except the PD-1 inhibitor achieved excellent result in CRC with DNA mismatch repair system deficiency. In this review, the authors will mainly introduce the immunophenotype of different subtype of CRC and summarize current advances of clinical trials for CRC immunotherapy. The article will also discuss the reasons for the low efficacy of immunotherapeutic approaches in CRC and provide several potential directions for the future development of CRC immunotherapy.

TI  - Durvalumab After Sequential Chemoradiotherapy in Stage III, Unresectable NSCLC: The Phase 2 PACIFIC-6 Trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF THORACIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: On the basis of the findings of the phase 3 PACIFIC trial (NCT02125461), durvalumab is standard of care for patients with stage III, unresectable NSCLC and no disease progression after concurrent chemoradiotherapy (cCRT). Many patients are considered unsuitable for cCRT owing to concerns with tolerability. The phase 2 PACIFIC-6 trial (NCT03693300) evaluates the safety and tolerability of durvalumab after sequential CRT (sCRT).Methods: Patients with stage III, unresectable NSCLC and no progression after platinum-based sCRT were enrolled to receive durvalumab (1500 mg intravenously) every 4 weeks for up to 24 months. The primary end point was the incidence of grade 3 or 4 adverse events possibly related to treatment occurring within 6 months. Secondary end points included investigator -assessed progression-free survival (PFS; Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1) and overall survival.Results: Overall, 117 patients were enrolled (59.8% with performance status >0, 65.8% aged >65 y, and 37.6% with stage IIIA disease). Median treatment duration was 32.0 weeks; 37.6% of patients remained on treatment at data cutoff (July 15, 2021). Grade 3 or 4 AEs occurred in 18.8% of patients. Five patients had grade 3 or 4 possibly related adverse events within 6 months (incidence: 4.3%; 95% confidence interval: 1.4-9.7), including two pneumonitis cases. Two patients (1.7%) had grade 5 AEs of any cause. Survival data maturity was limited. Median PFS was 10.9 months (95% confidence interval: 7.3-15.6), and 12-month PFS and overall survival rates were 49.6% and 84.1%, respectively.Conclusions: Durvalumab after sCRT had a comparable safety profile with that observed with durvalumab after cCRT in PACIFIC and had encouraging preliminary efficacy in a frailer population.

TI  - Efficacy of dendritic cell-cytokine induced killer cells combined with concurrent chemoradiotherapy on locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUON
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: To explore the efficacy and safety of docetaxel/ cisplatin concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) combined with dendritic cell-cytokine induced killer cell (DC-CIK) immunotherapy in the treatment of locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LANSCLC).Methods: The clinical data of 142 LANSCLC patients treated in our hospital from March 2014 to March 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. 71 patients were treated with docetaxel/cisplatin CCRT (CCRT group), while the remaining 71 patients underwent CCRT combined with DC-CIK immunotherapy (DC-CIK group). The clinical data of all patients were collected, the short-term efficacy, the changes in serum immunological indexes and quality of life before and after treatment, and the incidence of adverse reactions were compared between the two groups, and the overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were recorded during the follow-up of patients.Results: After treatment, the level of cluster of differentiation 3(+) (CD3(+)) CD4(+) T lymphocytes, CD4/CD8 ratio and CD56(+) natural killer (NK) cell ratio significantly rose, while the level of CD3(+) CD8(+) T lymphocytes significantly declined in both groups compared with those before treatment. After treatment, the level of CD3(+) CD4(+) T lymphocytes, CD4/ CD8 ratio and CD56(+) NK cell ratio were obviously higher, while the level of CD3(+) CD8(+) T lymphocytes was obviously lower in DC-CIK group than those in CCRT group. At 12 months after treatment, both Karnofsky performance scale (KPS) score and quality of life (QOL) score in DC-CIK group were evidently higher than those in CCRT group. In CCRT group and DC-CIK group, 1-year OS was 74.6% and 83.1%, and 1-year PFS was 70.4% and 73.2%, respectively. 2-year OS was 45.1% and 57.7%, and 2-year PFS was 38.0% and 46.5%), respectively. 3-year OS was 26.8% and 40.8%, and 3-year PFS was 15.5% and 22.5%, respectively. It can be seen that both OS and PFS in DC-CIK group were remarkably superior to those in CCRT group.Conclusion: Docetaxel/cisplatin CCRT combined with DCCIK can significantly enhance the cellular immunity, improve the long-term survival rate and raise the quality of life of LANSCLC patients, with tolerable adverse reactions.

AB  - 7. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACTThe proposed career development training award will provide the candidate, Dr. Bradford Perez, with anexcellent opportunity to establish as an independent clinical/translational investigator. As part of his translationaleffort he seeks to characterize tumor infiltrating immune cells to understand mechanism of synergy withradiation and immunotherapy combinations with a specific interest and plan to further evaluate anti-41bbtherapy in conjunction with radiation therapy. An improved understanding of this mechanism is critical torobust and successful implementation of combined modality strategies in the clinic. The work proposed as partof this award application will also allow Dr. Perez to grow and establish independence as a clinical investigator.He currently serves as the principal investigator for an ongoing investigator initiated clinical trial for patients withextensive stage small cell lung cancer. With the support of a strong mentorship team, he was able to draft theprotocol and navigate the necessary regulatory infrastructure to enroll patients on this Phase I/II trial. Thehuman tissue samples (serial peripheral blood and tumor samples) collected as part of this ongoing trial will bethoroughly analyzed as part of Research Aim 2 to help understand the precise mechanism by which RTmodulates the immune system. Through an improved understanding, future clinical studies as proposed inResearch Aim 3 can be rationally designed to maximize the opportunity for synergy with radiation andimmunotherapy.The application includes a robust plan that highlights Dr. Perez's limitations in prior training with a didacticprogram that is specifically designed overcome knowledge gaps in the fields of cancer immunity/immunotherapyand early stage clinical trial design. In working to establish independence, the final training aim includesdedicated career development focus on grant writing and publications. This training will help Dr. Perez to masterthe necessary skills crucial to success as an independent investigator.Drs. Antonia, Conejo-Garcia and Schell will closely advise and oversee Dr. Perez's career development andrepresent a team of international experts in the field of cancer clinical and translational investigation. Theproposed training in this K08 NCI Mentored Clinical Scientist training grant for patient oriented research willallow Dr. Perez to transition to an independent clinical and translational researcher.

TI  - A randomized phase II study of SRL172 (<i>Mycobacterium vacca</i>e) combined with chemotherapy in patients with advanced inoperable non-small-cell lung cancer and mesothelioma
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Mycobacterial preparations have been used with limited success against cancer apart from superficial bladder cancer. Recently, a therapeutic vaccine derived from Mycobacterium vaccae has been given to patients with prostate cancer and melanoma indicating a possible beneficial effect on disease activity in such patients. We have recently initiated a series of randomized studies to test the feasibility and toxicity of combining a preparation of heat-killed Mycobacterium vaccae (designated SRL172) with a multidrug chemotherapy regimen to treat patients with inoperable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and mesothelioma. 28 evaluable patients with previously untreated symptomatic NSCLC and mesothelioma were randomized to receive either 3 weekly intravenous combination chemotherapy alone, or chemotherapy given with monthly intra-dermal injections of SRL172. Safety and tolerability were scored by common toxicity criteria and efficacy was evaluated by survival of patients and by tumour response assessed by CT scanning. The toxicity of chemotherapy was similar in the two groups. SRL172 caused mild inflammation at the injection site. In the group of patients randomized to receive chemotherapy combined with SRL172, there was a trend towards improved response rate (54% vs, 33%) with more patients in the combined arm receiving radical surgery and radiotherapy, improved median survival (9.7 months vs. 7.5 months) and improved 1 year survival (42% vs. 18%), SRL172 appeared to improve sleep (P = 0.08) and improved appetite (P = 0.01). There was no detectable change in serum cytokine levels for gamma-interferon and TNF-alpha before and after treatment. in patients with NSCLC and mesothelioma, there may be a beneficial interaction when chemotherapy is administered in combination with SRL172. Confirmation of this effect and further investigation is underway in a randomized phase III trial and in laboratory models. (C) 2000 Cancer Research Campaign.

TI  - Neoantigen vaccination induces clinical and immunologic responses in non-small cell lung cancer patients harboring EGFR mutations
T2  - JOURNAL FOR IMMUNOTHERAPY OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Neoantigen (NeoAg) peptides displayed at the tumor cell surface by human leukocyte antigen molecules show exquisite tumor specificity and can elicit T cell mediated tumor rejection. However, few NeoAgs are predicted to be shared between patients, and none to date have demonstrated therapeutic value in the context of vaccination. Methods We report here a phase I trial of personalized NeoAg peptide vaccination (PPV) of 24 stage III/IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who had previously progressed following multiple conventional therapies, including surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Primary endpoints of the trial evaluated feasibility, tolerability, and safety of the personalized vaccination approach, and secondary trial endpoints assessed tumor-specific immune reactivity and clinical responses. Of the 16 patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, nine continued TKI therapy concurrent with PPV and seven patients received PPV alone. Results Out of 29 patients enrolled in the trial, 24 were immunized with personalized NeoAg peptides. Aside from transient rash, fatigue and/or fever observed in three patients, no other treatment-related adverse events were observed. Median progression-free survival and overall survival of the 24 vaccinated patients were 6.0 and 8.9 months, respectively. Within 3-4 months following initiation of PPV, seven RECIST-based objective clinical responses including one complete response were observed. Notably, all seven clinical responders had EGFR-mutated tumors, including four patients that had continued TKI therapy concurrently with PPV. Immune monitoring showed that five of the seven responding patients demonstrated vaccine-induced T cell responses against EGFR NeoAg peptides. Furthermore, two highly shared EGFR mutations (L858R and T790M) were shown to be immunogenic in four of the responding patients, all of whom demonstrated increases in peripheral blood neoantigen-specific CD8+ T cell frequencies during the course of PPV. Conclusions These results show that personalized NeoAg vaccination is feasible and safe for advanced-stage NSCLC patients. The clinical and immune responses observed following PPV suggest that EGFR mutations constitute shared, immunogenic neoantigens with promising immunotherapeutic potential for large subsets of NSCLC patients. Furthermore, PPV with concurrent EGFR inhibitor therapy was well tolerated and may have contributed to the induction of PPV-induced T cell responses.

TI  - Feasibility Study of Nivolumab in Combination with Carboplatin Plus Paclitaxel and Concurrent Thoracic Radiation in Patients with Untreated Unresectable Locally Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Lung cancer remains a leading cause of death despite advancements in treatment. A recent phase III trial has shown that adding an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) to standard chemoradiation therapy (CCRT) improves survival in patients with advanced lung cancer. A sub-analysis of the same study also showed that shortening the interval between CRT and ICI increased the clinical benefits. Therefore, a feasibility study of nivolumab plus CCRT was conducted in Japanese patients with unresectable locally advanced NSCLC. We enrolled 12 patients and examined 10 for dose-limiting toxicities (DLT). The treatment was considered feasible if DLT occurred in three or fewer of the ten evaluable patients, meeting the study criteria. The findings suggest that nivolumab combined with CCRT is a safe and promising treatment option for patients with previously untreated unresectable locally advanced NSCLC, potentially improving their chances of survival.Abstract Despite advancements in diagnosing and treating non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the prognosis remains poor. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have shown promise in enhancing survival rates. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the safety of nivolumab administration with concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CCRT) in patients with unresectable locally advanced NSCLC. Twelve patients with unresectable locally advanced NSCLC at Kansai Medical University Hospital and Izumi City General Medical Center were enrolled from May 2018 to September 2020. They received nivolumab (360 mg) tri-weekly twice, weekly carboplatin (AUC 2 min x mg/mL) and paclitaxel (40 mg/m2) for 6 weeks, and thoracic radiotherapy (60 Gy/30 fractions), followed by maintenance nivolumab therapy (360 mg, tri-weekly) for 6 months. The primary endpoint was incidence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), and the secondary endpoints included safety, response rate, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), 2-year survival rate, and treatment completion rate. Three patients completed the protocol. Nine discontinued due directly to interstitial pneumonia (three) and pneumonia (one). Ten patients (83.3%) experienced a grade 3 or higher event, of which three (25%) experienced a grade 4 or higher event, and of these, one (8.3%) experienced a grade 5 event. Three patients experienced DLTs. Concurrent nivolumab with CCRT was tolerated in unresectable locally advanced NSCLC, which offers potential treatment benefits.

TI  - Sugemalimab versus placebo after concurrent or sequential chemoradiotherapy in patients with locally advanced, unresectable, stage III non-small-cell lung cancer in China (GEMSTONE-301): interim results of a randomised, double-blind, multicentre, phase 3 trial
T2  - LANCET ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background A substantial proportion of patients with unresectable stage III non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cannot either tolerate or access concurrent chemoradiotherapy, so sequential chemoradiotherapy is commonly used. We assessed the efficacy and safety of sugemalimab, an anti-PD-L1 antibody, in patients with stage III NSCLC whose disease had not progressed after concurrent or sequential chemoradiotherapy.Methods GEMSTONE-301 is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial in patients with locally advanced, unresectable, stage III NSCLC, done at 50 hospitals or academic research centres in China. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 who had not progressed after concurrent or sequential chemoradiotherapy. We randomly assigned patients (2:1, using an interactive voice-web response system) to receive sugemalimab 1200 mg or matching placebo, intravenously every 3 weeks for up to 24 months. Stratification factors were ECOG performance status, previous chemoradiotherapy, and total radiotherapy dose. The investigators, trial coordination staff, patients, and study sponsor were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of assigned study treatment. The study has completed enrolment and the results of a preplanned analysis of the primary endpoint are reported here. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03728556.Findings Between Aug 30, 2018 and Dec 30, 2020, we screened 564 patients of whom 381 were eligible. Study treatment was received by all patients randomly assigned to sugemalimab (n=255) and to placebo (n=126). At data cutoff (March 8, 2021), median follow-up was 14.3 months (IQR 6.4-19-4) for patients in the sugemalimab group and 13.7 months (7.1-18-4) for patients in the placebo group. Progression-free survival assessed by BICR was significantly longer with sugemalimab than with placebo (median 9.0 months [95% CI 8.1-14.1] vs 5.8 months [9s% CI 4.2-6.6]; stratified hazard ratio 0.64 [95% CI 0-48-0.85], p=0-0026). Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 22 (9%) of 255 patients in the sugemalimab group versus seven (6%) of 126 patients in the placebo group, the most common being pneumonitis or immune-mediated pneumonitis (seven 13%1 of 255 patients in the sugemalimab group vs one (<1%1 of 126 in the placebo group). Treatment-related serious adverse events occurred in 38 (15%) patients in the sugemalimab group and 12 (10%) in the placebo group. Treatment-related deaths were reported in four (2%) of 255 patients (pneumonia in two patients, pneumonia with immune-mediated pneumonitis in one patient, and acute hepatic failure in one patient) in the sugemalimab group and none in the placebo group.Interpretation Sugemalimab after definitive concurrent or sequential chemoradiotherapy could be an effective consolidation therapy for patients with stage III NSCLC whose disease has not progressed after sequential or concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Longer follow-up is needed to confirm this conclusion. Copyright (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - 7. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACTThe proposed career development training award will provide the candidate, Dr. Bradford Perez, with anexcellent opportunity to establish as an independent clinical/translational investigator. As part of his translationaleffort he seeks to characterize tumor infiltrating immune cells to understand mechanism of synergy withradiation and immunotherapy combinations with a specific interest and plan to further evaluate anti-41bbtherapy in conjunction with radiation therapy. An improved understanding of this mechanism is critical torobust and successful implementation of combined modality strategies in the clinic. The work proposed as partof this award application will also allow Dr. Perez to grow and establish independence as a clinical investigator.He currently serves as the principal investigator for an ongoing investigator initiated clinical trial for patients withextensive stage small cell lung cancer. With the support of a strong mentorship team, he was able to draft theprotocol and navigate the necessary regulatory infrastructure to enroll patients on this Phase I/II trial. Thehuman tissue samples (serial peripheral blood and tumor samples) collected as part of this ongoing trial will bethoroughly analyzed as part of Research Aim 2 to help understand the precise mechanism by which RTmodulates the immune system. Through an improved understanding, future clinical studies as proposed inResearch Aim 3 can be rationally designed to maximize the opportunity for synergy with radiation andimmunotherapy.The application includes a robust plan that highlights Dr. Perez's limitations in prior training with a didacticprogram that is specifically designed overcome knowledge gaps in the fields of cancer immunity/immunotherapyand early stage clinical trial design. In working to establish independence, the final training aim includesdedicated career development focus on grant writing and publications. This training will help Dr. Perez to masterthe necessary skills crucial to success as an independent investigator.Drs. Antonia, Conejo-Garcia and Schell will closely advise and oversee Dr. Perez's career development andrepresent a team of international experts in the field of cancer clinical and translational investigation. Theproposed training in this K08 NCI Mentored Clinical Scientist training grant for patient oriented research willallow Dr. Perez to transition to an independent clinical and translational researcher.

TI  - Checkpoint Inhibitors in Combination With Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors The CHEERS Phase 2 Randomized Clinical Trial
T2  - JAMA ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Importance Although immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and PD-1 ligand 1 have improved the outcome for many cancer types, the majority of patients fails to respond to ICI monotherapy. Hypofractionated radiotherapy has the potential to improve the therapeutic ratio of ICIs.Objective To assess the addition of radiotherapy to ICIs compared with ICI monotherapy in patients with advanced solid tumors.Design, Setting, and Participants This open-label, multicenter, randomized phase 2 trial was conducted in 5 Belgian hospitals and enrolled participants between March 2018 and October 2020. Patients 18 years or older with locally advanced or metastatic melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, urothelial carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, or non-small cell lung carcinoma were eligible. A total of 99 patients were randomly assigned to either the control arm (n = 52) or the experimental arm (n = 47). Of those, 3 patients (1 in the control arm vs 2 in the experimental arm) withdrew consent and thus were not included in the analysis. Data analyses were performed between April 2022 and March 2023.Interventions Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive anti-PD-1/PD-1 ligand 1 ICIs alone as per standard of care (control arm) or combined with stereotactic body radiotherapy 3 x 8 gray to a maximum of 3 lesions prior to the second or third ICI cycle, depending on the frequency of administration (experimental arm). Randomization was stratified according to tumor histologic findings and disease burden (3 and fewer or more than 3 cancer lesions).Main Outcomes and Measures The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) as per immune Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. Key secondary end points included overall survival (OS), objective response rate, local control rate, and toxic effects. Efficacy was assessed in the intention-to-treat population, while safety was evaluated in the as-treated population.Results Among 96 patients included in the analysis (mean age, 66 years; 76 [79%] female), 72 (75%) had more than 3 tumor lesions and 65 (68%) had received at least 1 previous line of systemic treatment at time of inclusion. Seven patients allocated to the experimental arm did not complete the study-prescribed radiotherapy course due to early disease progression (n = 5) or intercurrent illness (n = 2). With a median (range) follow-up of 12.5 (0.7-46.2) months, median PFS was 2.8 months in the control arm compared with 4.4 months in the experimental arm (hazard ratio, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.58-1.53; P = .82). Between the control and experimental arms, no improvement in median OS was observed (11.0 vs 14.3 months; hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.48-1.41; P = .47), and objective response rate was not statistically significantly different (22% vs 27%; P = .56), despite a local control rate of 75% in irradiated patients. Acute treatment-related toxic effects of any grade and grade 3 or higher occurred in 79% and 18% of patients in the control arm vs 78% and 18% in the experimental arm, respectively. No grade 5 adverse events occurred.Conclusions and Relevance This phase 2 randomized clinical trial demonstrated that while safe, adding subablative stereotactic radiotherapy of a limited number of metastatic lesions to ICI monotherapy failed to show improvement in PFS or OS.

TI  - Modern Radiation Further Improves Survival in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: An Analysis of 288,670 Patients
T2  - JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Radiation therapy plays an increasingly important role in the treatment of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The purpose of the present study is to assess the survival outcomes of radiotherapy treatment compared to other treatment modalities and to determine the potential role of advanced technologies in radiotherapy on improving survival.Methods: We used cancer incidence and survival data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database linked to U.S. Census data to compare survival outcomes of 288,670 patients with stage I-IV NSCLC treated between 1999 and 2008. The primary endpoint was overall survival.Results: Among the 288,670 patients diagnosed with stage I-IV NSCLC, 92,374 (32%) patients received radiotherapy-almost double the number receiving surgery (51,961, 18%). Compared to other treatment groups and across all stages of NSCLC, patients treated with radiotherapy showed greater median and overall survival than patients without radiation treatment (p < 0.0001). Radiotherapy had effectively improved overall survival regardless of age, gender, and histological categorization. Radiotherapy treatment received during the recent time period 2004 - 2008 is correlated with enhanced survival compared to the earlier time period 1999 - 2003.Conclusion: Radiation therapy was correlated with increased overall survival for all patients with primary NSCLC across stages. Combined surgery and radiotherapy treatment also correlates with improved survival, signaling the value of bimodal or multimodal treatments. Population-based increases in overall survival were seen in the recent time period, suggesting the potential role of advanced radiotherapeutic technologies in enhancing survival outcomes for lung cancer patients.

TI  - INSPIRE: A phase III study of the BLP25 liposome vaccine (L-BLP25) in Asian patients with unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer
T2  - BMC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Previous research suggests the therapeutic cancer vaccine L-BLP25 potentially provides a survival benefit in patients with locally advanced unresectable stage III non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). These promising findings prompted the phase III study, INSPIRE, in patients of East-Asian ethnicity. East-Asian ethnicity is an independent favourable prognostic factor for survival in NSCLC. The favourable prognosis is most likely due to a higher incidence of EGFR mutations among this patient population.Methods/design: The primary objective of the INSPIRE study is to assess the treatment effect of L-BLP25 plus best supportive care (BSC), as compared to placebo plus BSC, on overall survival time in East-Asian patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC and either documented stable disease or an objective response according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria following primary chemoradiotherapy. Those in the L-BLP25 arm will receive a single intravenous infusion of cyclophosphamide (300 mg/m(2)) 3 days before the first L-BLP25 vaccination, with a corresponding intravenous infusion of saline to be given in the control arm. A primary treatment phase of 8 subcutaneous vaccinations of L-BLP25 930 mu g or placebo at weekly intervals will be followed by a maintenance treatment phase of 6-weekly vaccinations continued until disease progression or discontinuation from the study.Discussion: The ongoing INSPIRE study is the first large study of a therapeutic cancer vaccine specifically in an East-Asian population. It evaluates the potential of maintenance therapy with L-BLP25 to prolong survival in East-Asian patients with stage III NSCLC where there are limited treatment options currently available.

TI  - A review on the effects of current chemotherapy drugs and natural agents in treating non-small cell lung cancer.
T2  - BioMedicine
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide, and this makes it an attractive disease to review and possibly improve therapeutic treatment options. Surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, targeted treatments, and immunotherapy separate or in combination are commonly used to treat lung cancer. However, these treatment types may cause different side effects, and chemotherapy-based regimens appear to have reached a therapeutic plateau. Hence, effective, better-tolerated treatments are needed to address and hopefully overcome this conundrum. Recent advances have enabled biologists to better investigate the potential use of natural compounds for the treatment or control of various cancerous diseases. For the past 30 years, natural compounds have been the pillar of chemotherapy. However, only a few compounds have been tested in cancerous patients and only partial evidence is available regarding their clinical effectiveness. Herein, we review the research on using current chemotherapy drugs and natural compounds (Wortmannin and Roscovitine, Cordyceps militaris, Resveratrol, OSU03013, Myricetin, Berberine, Antroquinonol) and the beneficial effects they have on various types of cancers including non-small cell lung cancer. Based on this literature review, we propose the use of these compounds along with chemotherapy drugs in patients with advanced and/or refractory solid tumours.

TI  - Immunotherapy in small cell lung cancer: one step at a time: a narrative review
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL LUNG CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy has been the standard of care for many years for patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Despite exceptionally high responses (up to 80%) with chemotherapy, the majority of patients relapse rapidly within weeks to months after treatment completion. Therefore, new and better treatment options are necessary. Recently, synergistic activity has been reported for the addition of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) to standard platinum-based chemotherapy in the therapeutic strategy of advanced SCLC. For the first time after several decades, a significant survival improvement was achieved for this population. However, the overwhelming majority of patients do not respond to ICI, or relapse rapidly. There is need for better knowledge about the biology, histopathologic features, and molecular pathways of SCLC. This can probably help to identify the optimal predictive biomarkers, which are warranted to develop an individual therapeutic strategy including the rational use of a combination of immunotherapeutic agents. Here, we provide an overview of the rationale for and clinical results of the completed and ongoing trials using different strategies of immunotherapy in SCLC. In addition, opportunities for further improvement of therapies will be discussed, including the addition of radiotherapy, co-stimulatory antibodies, and other immune modifying agents.

TI  - Final results of the IFCT-0803 study, a phase II study of cetuximab, pemetrexed, cisplatin, and concurrent radiotherapy in patients with locally advanced, unresectable, stage III, non-squamous, non-small-cell lung cancer
T2  - CANCER RADIOTHERAPIE
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose. - Roughly 20% of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer exhibit locally advanced, unresectable, stage III disease. Concurrent platinum-based chemoradiotherapy is the backbone treatment, which is followed by maintenance immunotherapy, yet with poor long-term prognosis. This phase II trial (IFCT-0803) sought to evaluate whether adding cetuximab to cisplatin and pemetrexed chemoradiotherapy would improve its efficacy in these patients. Materials and methods. - Eligible patients received weekly cetuximab (loading dose 400 mg/m2 day 1; subsequent weekly 250 mg/m2 doses until two weeks postradiotherapy). Chemotherapy comprised cis-platin (75 mg/m2) and pemetrexed (500 mg/m2), both delivered on day 1 of a 21-day cycle of maximally four. Irradiation with maximally 66 Gy started on day 22. Disease control rate at week 16 was the primary endpoint. Results. - One hundred and six patients were included (99 eligible patients). Compliance exceeded 95% for day 1 of chemotherapy cycles 1 to 4, with 76% patients receiving the 12 planned cetuximab doses. Maximal grade 3 toxicity occurred in 63% patients, and maximal grade 4 in 9.6%. The primary endpoint involving the first 95 eligible patients comprised two (2.1%) complete responses, 57 (60.0%) partial responses, and 27 (28.4%) stable diseases. This 90.5% disease control rate (95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 84.6%-96.4%) was achieved at week 16. After median 63.0-month follow-up, one-year and two-year survival rates were 75.8% and 59.5%. Median overall survival was 35.8 months (95% CI: 23.5-NR), and median progression -free survival 14.4 months (95% CI: 11.2-18.8), with one-year and two-year progression-free survival rates of 57.6% and 34.3%. Conclusion. - These survival rates compare favourably with published data, thus justifying further deve-lopment of cetuximab-based induction chemoradiotherapy.(c) 2022 Les Auteurs.

TI  - Predicting Survival in Patients with Advanced NSCLC Treated with Atezolizumab Using Pre- and on-Treatment Prognostic Biomarkers
T2  - CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY & THERAPEUTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Existing survival prediction models rely only on baseline or tumor kinetics data and lack machine learning integration. We introduce a novel kinetics-machine learning (kML) model that integrates baseline markers, tumor kinetics, and four on-treatment simple blood markers (albumin, C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, and neutrophils). Developed for immune-checkpoint inhibition (ICI) in non-small cell lung cancer on three phase II trials (533 patients), kML was validated on the two arms of a phase III trial (ICI and chemotherapy, 377 and 354 patients). It outperformed the current state-of-the-art for individual predictions with a test set C-index of 0.790, 12-months survival accuracy of 78.7% and hazard ratio of 25.2 (95% CI: 10.4-61.3, P < 0.0001) to identify long-term survivors. Critically, kML predicted the success of the phase III trial using only 25 weeks of on-study data (predicted HR = 0.814 (0.64-0.994) vs. final study HR = 0.778 (0.65-0.931)). Modeling on-treatment blood markers combined with predictive machine learning constitutes a valuable approach to support personalized medicine and drug development.

TI  - Consolidation treatments after chemoradiotherapy in patients with locally advanced inoperable non-small cell lung cancer: a systematic review and network meta-analysis protocol
T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) is the standard of care for inoperable locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer. To further improve prognosis, the use of consolidation treatments after CCRT has been explored extensively. Although durvalumab is the only consolidation treatment recommended by national clinical practice guidelines, there have been many studies exploring the effectiveness of other agents. However, until now, no studies have compared all agents systematically, and no studies have provided evidence for the optimal combination of different CCRTs and consolidation treatments regimens. This systematic review will evaluate the comparative clinical efficacy of consolidation therapies after CCRT as well as various combinations of CCRTs and consolidation therapies. Methods and analysis PubMed, the Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials (CENTRAL), EMBASE and ClinicalTrials.gov will be searched for relevant information. The estimated end date for the search will be 3 February 2022. Each stage of the review, including the study section, data extraction and risk of bias and quality of evidence assessments, will be performed in duplicate. We will include randomised controlled trials that included participants who received CCRT and consolidation treatment in at least one treatment arm. The primary endpoints will be overall survival and progression-free survival. Tumour response, health-related quality of life, disease-free survival and treatment-related toxicity will be presented as secondary outcomes. Both traditional meta-analysis and network meta-analysis (NMA) with the Bayesian approach will be conducted. Subgroup analyses and meta-regression will be completed to investigate heterogeneity, and sensitivity analyses will be conducted to assess the robustness of the findings. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval and patient consent are not required as this study is a meta-analysis based on published studies. The results of this study will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal for publication. In case of any changes in the protocol, protocol amendments will be updated in PROSPERO and explanations of these modifications will be described in the final report of this review. The results of this systematic review and NMA will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. PROSPERO registration number CRD42021239433.

AB  - Recent accomplishments include the following: BINTRAFUSP ALFA, A BIFUNCTIONAL FUSION PROTEIN TARGETING TGF-BETA AND PD- L1, IN PATIENTS WITH HUMAN PAPILLOMAVIRUS-ASSOCIATED MALIGNANCIES. Bintrafusp alfa is a first-in-class bifunctional fusion protein composed of the extracellular domain of transforming growth factor (TGF)-betaRII (a TGF-beta "trap") fused to a human IgG1 mAb blocking programmed cell death ligand 1. This is the largest analysis of patients with advanced, pretreated human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated malignancies treated with bintrafusp alfa. In these phase 1 and phase 2 trials, patients with advanced, pretreated, checkpoint inhibitor- naive HPV- associated cancers received bintrafusp alfa intravenously every 2 weeks until progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal. Primary endpoint was best overall response per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) V.1.1; other endpoints included safety. The confirmed objective response rate per RECIST V.1.1 in the checkpoint inhibitor-naive, full-analysis population was approximately 30% to 40% (including some complete responses); eight patients had stable disease (disease control rate, 44%). In addition, three patients experienced a delayed partial response after initial disease progression, for a total clinical response rate of approximately 35% (95% CI, 23.6% to 49.1%). Approximately 83%of patients experienced treatment-related adverse events, which were grade 3/4 in 16 patients. No treatment-related deaths occurred. Bintrafusp alfa showed clinical activity and manageable safety and is a promising treatment in HPV-associated cancers. These findings support further investigation of immunotherapy in patients with advanced HPV-associated cancers.

TI  - Intracranial response pattern, tolerability and biomarkers associated with brain metastases in non-small cell lung cancer treated by tislelizumab plus chemotherapy
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL LUNG CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Programmed cell death protein-1/programmed cell death protein-ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) inhibitor and chemotherapy are the standard treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) without sensitizing mutations. However, patients with untreated, symptomatic or recently-irradiated brain metastases (BMs) are mostly excluded from immunochemotherapy trials. This study aims to evaluate the intracranial response pattern, tolerability and biomarkers of tislelizumab plus chemotherapy in NSCLC with untreated, symptomatic or recently-irradiated BM. Methods: This multicenter, single-arm, phase 2 trial enrolled patients with treatment-na & iuml;ve, brainmetastasized NSCLC. BM could be untreated or irradiated. Symptomatic or recently-irradiated BMs that were deemed clinically stable were allowed. Patients received tislelizumab (200 mg) plus pemetrexed (500 mg/m2) and carboplatin (AUC =5) on day 1 every 3 weeks for 4 cycles, followed by maintenance with tislelizumab plus pemetrexed. Primary endpoint was 1-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate. Secondary endpoints included intracranial efficacy and tolerability. PD-L1 expression, tumor mutational burden (TMB) and genomic alterations were evaluated as potential biomarkers. Results: A total of 36 patients were enrolled, 19.2% had prior brain radiotherapy, 8.3% had symptomatic BMs that required corticosteroids <= 10 mg/d or antiepileptics. Confirmed systemic and intracranial ORR (iORR) was 43.8% and 46.7%, respectively. One-year systematic PFS rate and One-year iPFS rate was 36.8% and 55.8%, respectively. About 41.7% patients had neurological adverse events, 90% patients had concordant intracranial-extracranial responses. No intracranial pseudoprogression or hyperprogression occurred. Patients with prior brain radiation trended towards higher systemic (83.3% vs. 34.6%) and iORR (75.0% vs. 42.3%). Similar intracranial efficacy was observed in tumors with different PD-L1 and TMB levels, while alterations in cytokine receptors pathway predicted higher iORR (P=0.081), prolonged Conclusions: Untreated or irradiated BMs in NSCLC follows a conventional response and progression pattern under immunochemotherapy with altered cytokine receptors pathway being a potential biomarker for systemic and intracranial outcomes.

TI  - Long-term effectiveness and treatment sequences in patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer receiving atezolizumab plus chemotherapy: Results of the IFCT-1905 CLINATEZO real-world study
T2  - LUNG CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) has a tendency towards recurrence and limited survival. Standard-of -care in 1st-line is platinum-etoposide chemotherapy plus atezolizumab or durvalumab, based on land-mark clinical trials.Methods: IFCT-1905 CLINATEZO is a nationwide, non-interventional, retrospective study of patients with extensive-SCLC receiving atezolizumab plus chemotherapy as part of French Early Access Program. Objectives were to analyse effectiveness, safety and subsequent treatments.Results: The population analyzed included 518 patients who received atezolizumab in 65 participating centers. There were 66.2% male, mean age was 65.7 years; 89.1% had a performance status (PS) 0/1 and 26.6% brain metastases. Almost all (95.9%) were smokers. Fifty-five (10.6%) received at least 1 previous treatment. Median number of atezolizumab injections was 7.0 (range [1.0-48.0]) for a median duration of 4.9 months (95% CI 4.5-5.1). Atezolizumab was continued beyond progression in 122 patients (23.6%) for a median duration of 1.9 months (95% CI: [1.4-2.3]). Best objective response was complete and partial in 19 (3.9%) and 378 (77.1%) patients. Stable disease was observed in 50 patients (10.2%). Median follow-up was 30.8 months (95% CI: [29.9-31.5]). Median overall survival (OS), 12-, 24-month OS rates were 11.3 months (95% CI: [10.1-12.4]), 46.7% (95% CI [42.3-50.9]) and 21.2% (95% CI [17.7-24.8]). Median real-world progression-free survival, 6-, 12-month rates were 5.2 months (95% CI [5.0-5.4]), 37.5% (95% CI [33.3-41.7]) and 15.2% (95% CI [12.2-18.6]). For patients with PS 0/1, median OS was 12.2 months (95% CI [11.0-13.5]). For patients with previous treatment, median OS was 14.9 months (95% CI [10.1-21.5]). Three-hundred-and-twenty-six patients (66.4%) received subsequent treatment and 27 (5.2%) were still under atezolizumab at date of last news.Conclusions: IFCT-1905 CLINATEZO shows reproductibility, in real-life, of IMpower-133 survival outcomes, possibly attributed to selection of patients fit for this regimen, adoption of pragmatic approaches, including concurrent radiotherapy and treatment beyond progression.

TI  - Induction treatment in patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL LUNG CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) comprises a highly heterogeneous group of patients defined according to the extent and localization of disease. Patients with discrete N2 involvement identified preoperatively with resectable disease are candidates for multimodal therapy either with definitive chemoradiation therapy, induction chemotherapy, or chemoradiotherapy (CTRT) followed by surgery. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has yielded comparable survival benefit to adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with stage II-III disease and may allow for downstaging the tumor or the lymph nodes, an earlier delivery of systemic treatment, and better compliance to systemic therapy. The use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) as induction therapy shows encouraging activity and a favorable safety profile in patients with resectable early stage or locally advanced NSCLC. An unprecedented rate of pathological response and downstaging has been reported in single-arm clinical trials, especially when immunotherapy is combined with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Ongoing randomized phase II/III clinical trials assessing the efficacy and safety of induction with immunotherapy plus chemotherapy have the potential to establish this therapeutic approach as a novel standard of care. These trials aim to validate pathological response as a surrogate marker of survival benefit and to demonstrate that this therapeutic strategy can improve the cure rate in patients with stage II-III NSCLC.

AB  - Locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is characterized by poor prognosis and is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. The main problem in NSCLC is treatment resistance and a high potential for progression and metastasis, which results in low survival rates for patients. Immunotherapy (IO) alone or combined with chemotherapy and targeted therapies, while dedicated to selective subgroups of patients, replaced traditional cytotoxic therapies (radiotherapy or chemotherapy) in advanced stages of disease. Therefore, it's important to search for new features that may help predict the effectiveness of currently available therapies. The paper presents preliminary results of exploratory data and survival analyses (Kaplan-Meier survival curves, uni- and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models), indicating potential factors that may help stratify the group of patients to select the appropriate treatment.

TI  - Multidisciplinary approach for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC): 2023 expert consensus of the Spanish Lung Cancer Group GECP
T2  - CLINICAL & TRANSLATIONAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Introduction Recent advances in the treatment of locally advanced NSCLC have led to changes in the standard of care for this disease. For the selection of the best approach strategy for each patient, it is necessary the homogenization of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, as well as the promotion of the evaluation of patients by a multidisciplinary oncology team.Objective Development of an expert consensus document with suggestions for the approach and treatment of locally advanced NSCLC leaded by Spanish Lung Cancer Group GECP.Methods Between March and July 2023, a panel of 28 experts was formed. Using a mixed technique (Delphi/nominal group) under the guidance of a coordinating group, consensus was reached in 4 phases: 1. Literature review and definition of discussion topics 2. First round of voting 3. Communicating the results and second round of voting 4. Definition of conclusions in nominal group meeting. Responses were consolidated using medians and interquartile ranges. The threshold for agreement was defined as 85% of the votes.Results New and controversial situations regarding the diagnosis and management of locally advanced NSCLC were analyzed and reconciled based on evidence and clinical experience. Discussion issues included: molecular diagnosis and biomarkers, radiologic and surgical diagnosis, mediastinal staging, role of the multidisciplinary thoracic committee, neoadjuvant treatment indications, evaluation of response to neoadjuvant treatment, postoperative evaluation, and follow-up.Conclusions Consensus clinical suggestions were generated on the most relevant scenarios such as diagnosis, staging and treatment of locally advanced lung cancer, which will serve to support decision-making in daily practice.

M3  - Case Reports
AB  - As an exceedingly recalcitrant and highly aggressive tumor type without Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment or a known cure, the prognosis of recurrent extensive stage platinum-resistant/refractory small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is worse than other types of lung cancer, and many other tumor types, given a response rate of less than 10% and an overall survival of less than six months. It was broadly classified into three groups based on the initial response to cisplatin/etoposide therapy, platinum-refractory, platinum-resistant, and platinum-sensitive, extensive stage SCLC inevitably relapses, at which point the only standard options are to rechallenge with the first-line chemotherapeutic regimen in the case of sensitive disease or to start the topoisomerase I inhibitor, topotecan. Sensitive disease is defined by a response to the first-line therapy and a treatment-free interval of at least 90 days, while the definitions of refractory and resistant disease, respectively, are nonresponse to the first-line treatment or relapse within 90 days. As an important predictor of response to the second-line treatment, the clinical cutoff of three months (or two months in some cases) for resistant and sensitive disease, which along with performance status prognostically separates patients into high- and low-risk categories, dictates subsequent management. This case report presents a resistant SCLC patient enrolled on a Phase II clinical trial called QUADRUPLE THREAT (formerly TRIPLE THREAT; NCT02489903) who responded to reintroduced platinum doublets after sequential priming with the resistance-reversing epi-immunotherapeutic agent, RRx-001. In the QUADRUPLE THREAT clinical trial, both during priming with RRx-001 and during sequential treatment with platinum doublets, the patient maintained a good quality of life and performance status.

T2  - TRANSLATIONAL LUNG CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - For patients with inoperable stage II-III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the backbone of curative intent therapy is concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT). As checkpoint inhibitors have shown clinical benefit in the setting of metastatic NSCLC, additional study is necessary to understand their role in patients receiving CRT. When integrating immunotherapy with radiotherapy (RT) for cure, clinicians will need to consider synergy, timing, doses, and safety among the combination of therapies. This article seeks to review data evaluating interactions, temporal sequencing, fractionation, and overlapping toxicity profiles of thoracic chemoradiation and immunotherapy.

M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Surgery of the primary tumor following extended course of chemoimmunotherapy has only recently been recognized as a feasible and safe option for selected groups of patients with initially unresectable non-small cell lung cancer. Case outline Here we report a case of a 49-year-old female patient, who never smoked, that was diagnosed with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Lesions were evident in both lungs and the brain. She underwent stereotactic radiosurgery for brain metastases and combination therapy of chemotherapy, atezolizumab and bevacizumab. Response to therapy was both remarkable and durable. Ten cycles into treatment, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed no metastatic lesions. Positron emission tomography / computed tomography revealed a single lesion in the right upper lobe 22 x 23 mm in diameter. The patient underwent a right upper lobectomy. Pathohistological evaluation of the specimen revealed complete pathologic response. The patient recovered from surgery and continued chemoimmunotherapy. Four months post-surgery she is disease free and of excellent performance status. Conclusion Primary tumor surgery following extensive chemoimmunotherapy regiment is feasible and could be considered as a treatment option. Further research is warranted to define a patient population that stands to benefit the most from this modality.

TI  - Targeted Radionuclide Therapy in Patient-Derived Xenografts Using <SUP>177</SUP>Lu-EB-RGD
T2  - MOLECULAR CANCER THERAPEUTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, most patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are diagnosed in advanced stages with a poor fiveyear survival rate. Therefore, intensive research aimed at finding novel therapeutic strategies has been ongoing; experimental models that reliably emulate NSCLC disease are greatly needed to predict responses to novel therapeutics. Therefore, we developed patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of NSCLC, which we then used to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of Lu-177-EB-RGD, a peptide-based radiopharmaceutical with improved pharmacokinetics that targets integrin alpha(v)beta(3). In this study, three different groups of NSCLC-PDXs were successfully established, all of which maintained the same IHC and genetic characteristics of the human primary tumor. The two NSCLCPDX groups with intense and low expression of integrin avb3 ( denoted as PDX alpha v beta+ and PDX alpha v beta 3- ) were chosen as the experimental models to evaluate the in vivo biological behavior of Lu-177-EB-RGD. In SPECT imaging and biodistribution studies, Lu-177-EB-RGD showed significantly higher accumulation in PDX alpha v beta+ and PDX alpha v beta 3-. models than its corresponding monomer Lu-177-RGD. A single dose of 18.5 MBq Lu-177-EB-RGD was enough to completely eradicate the tumors in PDX alpha v beta+, with no sign of tumor recurrence during the observation period. Such treatment was also efficacious in PDX alpha v beta 3-: a single dose of 29.6 MBq Lu-177-EB-RGD led to a significant delay in tumor growth as compared with that in the control or Lu-177-RGD group. The preclinical data from the use of this model suggest that Lu-177-EB-RGD may be an effective treatment option for NSCLC and should be further evaluated in human trials.

TI  - Induction chemoimmunotherapy with surgery versus concurrent chemoradiation followed by immunotherapy for stage III-N2 non - small cell lung cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF THORACIC AND CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Despite the growing relevance of immunotherapy for non - small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), there is limited consensus on the optimal treatment strategy for locally advanced NSCLC. This study evaluated the overall survival of patients with stage III -N2 NSCLC undergoing induction chemoimmunotherapy with surgery (CT/IO + Surgery) and de fi nitive concurrent chemoradiation followed by immunotherapy (cCRT + IO). Methods: Patients with cT1-3, N2, M0 NSCLC in the National Cancer Database (2013 to 2019) were included and strati fi ed by treatment regimen: CT/IO + Surgery or cCRT + IO. Overall survival was evaluated using Kaplan -Meier analysis, Cox proportional hazards modeling, and propensity score matching on 10 prognostic variables. Results: Of the 3382 patients who met the study eligibility criteria, 3289 (97.3 % ) received cCRT + IO and 93 (2.8 % ) received CT/IO + Surgery. The 3 -year overall survival of the entire cohort was 58.2 % (95 % CI, 56.2 % to 60.1 % ). Multivariableadjusted Cox proportional hazards modeling demonstrated better survival after CT/IO + Surgery than after cCRT + IO (hazard ratio [HR], 0.52; 95 % con fi dence interval [CI], 0.32 to 0.84; P = .007). In a 3:1 variable ratio propensity scorematched analysis of 223 patients who received cCRT + IO and 76 patients who received CT/IO + Surgery, 3 -year overall survival was 63.2 % (95 % CI, 55.9 % to 70.2 % ) after cCRT + IO and 77.2 % (95 % CI, 64.6 % to 85.7 % ) after CT/IO + Surgery ( P = .029). Conclusions: In this national analysis, multimodal treatment including immunotherapy was associated with a 3 -year overall survival rate of 58.2 % for all patients with stage III -N2 NSCLC and 77.2 % for patients who underwent chemoimmunotherapy followed by surgery. These results should be considered hypothesisgenerating and demonstrate the importance of developing a randomized trial to evaluate the role of surgery versus chemoradiation for locally advanced NSCLC in the modern immunotherapy era.

TI  - Enhancing Chemoradiation Efficacy through Unbiased Drug Discovery Approaches
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - A major barrier to improving cure rates in locally advanced cancers is our inability to make progress beyond whatchemoradiation (CRT) can currently deliver. Combination strategies using molecular targeted therapies with CRThold promise for improving outcomes further. While many drugs could enhance the effects of radiation alone, wehave discovered that the effects are quite unpredictable when drugs are combined with chemotherapy andradiotherapy. The successful translation of adding molecular targeted agents to CRT would require anunderstanding of the molecular pathways that enable the cancer cell to survive under conditions of CRT.Inhibiting these pathways with molecular targeted drugs will be synergistic with CRT in the cancer-specificcontext. Using a set of molecular targeted drugs from the CTEP portfolio as an initial starting point, we willinvestigate two hard-to-treat cancer types treated with CRT, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and pancreaticductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We will identify drugs that could synergize with radiation and CRT using a highthroughput clonogenic survival screen that we have developed on validated cancer lines and then test the mostclinically promising combinations of agents to multiple cell lines with varying genetic backgrounds, first in vitroand then further validated using 2 in vivo models: a panel of patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) and orthotopictumor models using syngeneic tumors, all done in combination with clinically-relevant chemotherapies. Thepharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of these drugs with chemotherapy in animals and tumors willbe assessed in order to determine the optimal sequencing approach with conventionally fractionatedradiotherapy. Since we have discovered that chemotherapy significantly alters the response of cancer cells toradiation and targeted drugs, we will also evaluate the molecular mechanisms that explain the response to CRT,and identify potential factors that may influence this response using 4 major approaches. In the first more classicapproach, we will assess DNA damage repair pathways and reactive oxygen species generation when targetedagents are combined with radiation or CRT. Second, we will use reverse phase protein arrays (RPPA) to assessthe functional proteome to determine pathways that may be altered with molecular targeted drugs in the settingof RT or CRT. In the third approach, we will use Stable Isotope Labeling with Amino Acids (SILAC) to assessglobal proteomic and phosphoproteomic changes that occur with radiation and CRT treatment, and how thesepathways could be altered with specific molecular targeted therapies. Lastly, we will use Imaging MassSpectrometry to analyze drug distribution within the various tumor models and assess how thepharmacodynamic heterogeneity impacts CRT responsiveness. Our proposal will not only identify the mostpromising drugs that could best be combined with CRT in NSCLC and PDAC, but we will have identifiedmolecular and tumor factors that confer drug resistance which will enable future development of novel targetedstrategies to enhance CRT or appropriately select patient for personalized therapy. Our approach will generatethe high quality preclinical data and novel insights to fulfill the overall FOA objective, which is “to accelerate thepace at which combined modality treatments with greater efficacy are identified and incorporated into standardpractices for treatments”.

TI  - Diversity Supplement R01CA262388: Overcoming Hypoxic Resistance in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer By Targeting Mitochondrial Metabolism
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - PROJECT SUMMARY: Many groups are investigating why some lung cancer patients respond well to radio- andimmuno-therapies and some do not. One variable is tumor hypoxia, and many groups have shown it cansignificantly inhibit the effectiveness to these therapeutic modalities. Clinical studies have identified hypoxia asan independent prognostic indicator of poor patient outcomes, but even though this connection has been knownfor decades, no FDA-approved intervention exists to clinically overcome hypoxia. Some investigators have triedto deliver more oxygen to the tumor, but this approach remains constrained due to the poorly formed tumorvasculature. We have taken an innovative approach and asked if we can reduce demand for, rather than increasesupply of, oxygen to reduce hypoxia. We have found that the FDA-approved vasorelaxant papaverine (PPV) hasan off- target ability to inhibit mitochondrial complex 1, and reduce oxygen consumption rapidly, in low micromolarconcentrations in every cell line tested in vitro. We have also shown that PPV can enhance the effectiveness ofradiation and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in preclinical models of lung and other cancers, withoutsensitizing well-oxygenated normal tissue. Reducing hypoxia reverses immune privilege, decreases terminally-exhausted T cells, and increases progenitors that are responsive to PD-1 blockade. We have more recentlydeveloped new derivatives of PPV that have lost their vasorelaxant capability and increased their duration ofaction so that they can be improved immuno-sensitizers. We now propose to test the hypothesis that PPV caneffectively enhance the radio- and immuno-therapeutic treatment of preclinical models of lung cancer, and thatit is feasible to add PPV to standard of care therapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We haveexamined TCGA databases and found that lung cancer driver mutations in the KEAP1/NRF2 pathway lead tohigh levels of mitochondrial gene expression that can cause elevated oxygen metabolism contributing to hypoxia.In Aim 1, we will investigate the effects of oncogenic NRF2 activation human and murine cells and model tumorsto determine the dependence of these cells on mitochondrial function, how increased oxygen metabolismcontributes to tumor hypoxia, and if therapy-refractory tumors are sensitized by PPV or its derivatives. In Aim 2,we will examine the effect of tumor hypoxia on the migration and activation of T-cells in model tumors and howthe immune infiltrate changes after reduction of hypoxia with PPV or its derivatives. Finally, in Aim 3 we willperform a phase 1 clinical trial to determine if the addition of PPV is feasible for patients receiving standard ofcare chemoradiation followed by immunotherapy for advanced NSCLC. We will look for effectiveness in changingtumor oxygenation using paired blood level oxygen determination (BOLD) MRIs, and for changes in immunepopulations of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. These studies will let us know if, and how, to use PPV or itsnovel derivatives in future clinical trials for the treatment of NSCLC.

TI  - Therapeutic approaches for LKB1-deficient non-small cell lung cancer
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Therapeutic advances have been made in the treatment of subpopulations of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who harbor specific genomic alterations (e.g. EGFR mutation and ALK ROS gene rearrangements) which can be targeted with small molecule kinase inhibitors; however, the serine/threonine kinase STK11 (LKB1) is the second most commonly altered tumor suppressors in NSCLC, with genomic loss or inactivating mutations occurring in 20-30% of lung adenocarcinoma and there are currently no treatment strategies tailored for LKB1-deficient NSCLC. The PIs have developed preliminary data showing that in human tumor specimens and in Genetically Engineered Mouse Models of NSCLC with Lkb1 deletion that loss of LKB1 is associated with higher stage of disease at presentation, increased metastasis and poor overall prognosis as well as unique biological characteristics. This proposal will deeply characterize the distinct biology of LKB1- deficient NSCLCs with a focus on the immune microenvironment as a means to develop novel therapeutic approaches for patients with LKB1-deficient NSCLCs.

TI  - The Efficacy and Safety of Anlotinib in Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Multicenter Real-World Study
T2  - CANCER MANAGEMENT AND RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Anlotinib, an antiangiogenic multi-target tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), has shown favorable anticancer efficacy and acceptable safety in treating extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) in some clinical studies. This research aimed to explore the real-world efficacy and safety of anlotinib in ES-SCLC.Methods: Pathologically confirmed ES-SCLC patients receiving anlotinib were enrolled for this retrospective study. The primary endpoint of this study was progression-free survival (PFS), and secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), and adverse reactions.Results: In total, 202 patients were included in this study. The median PFS of all patients was 4.8 months [95% confidence interval (CI): 3.9-5.7], and the median OS was 7.6 months (95% CI 6.5-8.7). Respectively, the overall ORR and DCR were 30.2% and 87.1%. The univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses revealed that patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) <= 1, plus chemotherapy or immunotherapy, plus radiotherapy, and post-medication hypertension might have longer PFS and OS. The PFS and OS were significantly prolonged in combination group than that in monotherapy group [PFS 6.0 vs 3.6 months, hazards ratio (HR)=0.49, 95% CI 0.34-0.70, P < 0.001; OS 9.2 vs 4.8 months, HR = 0.48, 95% CI 0.32-0.72, P < 0.001]. The main treatment-related adverse reactions were generally tolerated. The incidence of adverse reactions in combination group was higher than that in monotherapy group (75.0% vs 52.6%, P = 0.001). The most common adverse reaction was hypertension, followed by hand-foot syndrome and fatigue, regardless of monotherapy or combination group.Conclusion: Anlotinib is effective and well tolerated in patients with ES-SCLC in the real-world. The clinical efficacy of anlotinib combined with chemotherapy or immunotherapy is better than that of monotherapy. Further investigations are needed for prospective studies with larger sample size.

TI  - SHORT-DURATION INVITRO INTERLEUKIN-2-ACTIVATED MONONUCLEAR-CELLS FOR ADVANCED CANCER - A HONG-KONG BIOTHERAPY PILOT-STUDY TRIAL
T2  - CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. In vitro studies have demonstrated that a brief exposure of peripherally collected mononuclear cells to high-dose human recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2) will generate a population of pulsed lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells. These cells have similar cytotoxicity against natural killer cells and resistant and sensitive target cells as compared with the standard LAK cells incubated for 3-7 days with rIL-2. Therefore, the authors conducted a pilot study to investigate the activity of pulsed LAK cells in patients with advanced cancer.Methods. Nineteen patients were enrolled in a pilot study, and pulsed LAK cell treatment was administered two times per week for 4 weeks, followed by similar cycles if patients remained free of disease progression and unacceptable toxic effects.Results. Toxic effects consisted mainly of fever, chills, nausea, and dizziness but were self-limiting and mild. Most cycles were administered on an outpatient basis. There were six partial responses (31%), occurring in two of three patients with renal cell carcinoma, two of four with hepatocellular carcinoma, one of seven with non-small cell lung carcinoma, and one of one with ovarian carcinoma. Two minimal responses were seen in one case each of melanoma and carcinoma of colon. Nine other patients had disease stabilization for 16 weeks, and two additional patients had disease progression. Pheno-typing of peripheral mononuclear cells showed increases in CD56 and CD25 populations with no in vivo rIL-2 being administered after treatment with pulsed LAK cells.Conclusions. The relative ease in generating pulsed LAK cells and the associated mild toxic effects enable prolonged stimulation of the effector cells of the patients against sensitive tumor targets, with a response rate comparable to those of high-dose rIL-2 and LAK cell treatment. Therefore, it may be a theoretically ideal adjuvant for patients with renal cell carcinoma, melanoma, and hepatoma and other applicable patients after bone marrow transplantation. The initial high response rate in patients with late-stage renal cell carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma indicates the need for additional confirmation.

TI  - Cytokine-induced killer cell therapy for modulating regulatory T cells in patients with non-small cell lung cancer
T2  - EXPERIMENTAL AND THERAPEUTIC MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous studies have reported that regulatory T cells (Tregs), which are physiologically engaged in the maintenance of immunological self-tolerance, have a critical role in the regulation of the antitumor immune response. Targeting Tregs has the potential to augment cancer vaccine approaches. The current study therefore aimed to evaluate the role of cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cell infusion in modulating Tregs in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A total of 15 patients with advanced NSCLC were treated by an infusion of CIK cells derived from autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). By using flow cytometry and liquid chip analysis, subsets of T cells and natural killer (NK) cells in peripheral blood, and plasma cytokine profiles in the treated patients, were analyzed at 2 and 4 weeks after CIK cell infusion. Cytotoxicity of PBMCs (n=15) and NK cells (n=6) isolated from NSCLC patients was evaluated before and after CIK cell therapy. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were also assessed. Analysis of the immune cell populations before and after treatment showed a significant increase in NK cells (P<0.05) concomitant with a significant decrease in Tregs (P<0.01) at 2 weeks post-infusion of CIK cells compared with the baseline. NK group 2D receptor (NKG2D) expression on NK cells was also significantly increased at 2 weeks post-infusion compared with the baseline (P<0.05). There was a positive correlation between NKG2D expression and the infusion number of CIK cells (P<0.05). When evaluated at 2 weeks after CIK cell therapy, the cytotoxicity of PBMCs and isolated NK cells was significantly increased compared with the baseline (P<0.01 and P<0.05). Correspondingly, plasma cytokine profiles showed significant enhancement of the following antitumor cytokines: Interferon (IFN)-gamma (P<0.05), IFN-gamma-inducible protein 10 (P<0.01), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (P<0.001), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (P<0.01), monocyte chemotactic protein-3 (P<0.01) and interleukin-21 (P<0.05) at 2 weeks post-infusion, compared with the baseline. At the same time, the expression of transforming growth factor-beta 1, which is primarily produced by Tregs, was significantly decreased compared with the baseline (P<0.05). Median PFS and OS in the CIK cell treatment group were significantly increased compared with the control group (PFS, 9.98 vs. 5.44 months, P=0.038; OS, 24.17 vs. 20.19 months, P=0.048). No severe side-effects were observed during the treatment period. In conclusion, CIK cell therapy was able to suppress. Tregs and enhance the antitumor immunity of NK cells in advanced NSCLC patients. Therefore, CIK cell treatment may improve PFS and OS in patients with advanced NSCLC. CIK cell infusion may have therapeutic value for patients with advanced NSCLC, as a treatment that can be combined with chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

TI  - Durvalumab after definitive chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC): Real-world data on survival and safety from the German expanded-access program (EAP)
T2  - LUNG CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Following the PACIFIC trial, durvalumab has been approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for consolidation of locally advanced PD-L1-positive NSCLC after chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Patients were treated with durvalumab in the EAP from 22.11.2017 to 15.10.2018 allowing analysis of its efficacy and safety.Methods: Data from 56 centres were analysed for adverse events (AE), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS).Results: 126 patients actually received at least 1 cycle durvalumab. Compared to the PACIFIC trial, the EAP population had more advanced stage and included "oligometastatic" stage IV patients and patients with autoimmune disease. PFS (20.1 months) and OS (not reached) were similar in the EAP and the PACIFIC trial. 42.9 % completed 12 months of durvalumab without deaths during FU. Stage IV patients (n = 7) had encouraging OS (not reached at 27 months). Autoimmune disease did not affect survival. PFS and OS were similar in PD-L1-negative patients (n = 32) and PD-L1-positive patients (n = 79).Conclusions: Survival in the EAP was comparable to the PACIFIC trial. Selected stage IV patients and patients with autoimmune disease may benefit from durvalumab consolidation and should be included in future immuno-oncological trials. PD-L1 did not predict survival challenging the exclusion of PD-L1-negative patients from durvalumab consolidation. In summary, durvalumab consolidation is safe and effective in a European real-world setting.

TI  - Enhancing Chemoradiation Efficacy through Unbiased Drug Discovery Approaches
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - A major barrier to improving cure rates in locally advanced cancers is our inability to make progress beyond whatchemoradiation (CRT) can currently deliver. Combination strategies using molecular targeted therapies with CRThold promise for improving outcomes further. While many drugs could enhance the effects of radiation alone, wehave discovered that the effects are quite unpredictable when drugs are combined with chemotherapy andradiotherapy. The successful translation of adding molecular targeted agents to CRT would require anunderstanding of the molecular pathways that enable the cancer cell to survive under conditions of CRT.Inhibiting these pathways with molecular targeted drugs will be synergistic with CRT in the cancer-specificcontext. Using a set of molecular targeted drugs from the CTEP portfolio as an initial starting point, we willinvestigate two hard-to-treat cancer types treated with CRT, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and pancreaticductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We will identify drugs that could synergize with radiation and CRT using a highthroughput clonogenic survival screen that we have developed on validated cancer lines and then test the mostclinically promising combinations of agents to multiple cell lines with varying genetic backgrounds, first in vitroand then further validated using 2 in vivo models: a panel of patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) and orthotopictumor models using syngeneic tumors, all done in combination with clinically-relevant chemotherapies. Thepharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of these drugs with chemotherapy in animals and tumors willbe assessed in order to determine the optimal sequencing approach with conventionally fractionatedradiotherapy. Since we have discovered that chemotherapy significantly alters the response of cancer cells toradiation and targeted drugs, we will also evaluate the molecular mechanisms that explain the response to CRT,and identify potential factors that may influence this response using 4 major approaches. In the first more classicapproach, we will assess DNA damage repair pathways and reactive oxygen species generation when targetedagents are combined with radiation or CRT. Second, we will use reverse phase protein arrays (RPPA) to assessthe functional proteome to determine pathways that may be altered with molecular targeted drugs in the settingof RT or CRT. In the third approach, we will use Stable Isotope Labeling with Amino Acids (SILAC) to assessglobal proteomic and phosphoproteomic changes that occur with radiation and CRT treatment, and how thesepathways could be altered with specific molecular targeted therapies. Lastly, we will use Imaging MassSpectrometry to analyze drug distribution within the various tumor models and assess how thepharmacodynamic heterogeneity impacts CRT responsiveness. Our proposal will not only identify the mostpromising drugs that could best be combined with CRT in NSCLC and PDAC, but we will have identifiedmolecular and tumor factors that confer drug resistance which will enable future development of novel targetedstrategies to enhance CRT or appropriately select patient for personalized therapy. Our approach will generatethe high quality preclinical data and novel insights to fulfill the overall FOA objective, which is “to accelerate thepace at which combined modality treatments with greater efficacy are identified and incorporated into standardpractices for treatments”.

TI  - Neoadjuvant and Adjuvant Treatments for Early Stage Resectable NSCLC: Consensus Recommendations From the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer.
T2  - Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - Advances in the multidisciplinary care of early stage resectable NSCLC (rNSCLC) are emerging at an unprecedented pace. Numerous phase 3 trials produced results that have transformed patient outcomes for the better, yet these findings also require important modifications to the patient treatment journey trajectory and reorganization of care pathways. Perhaps, most notably, the need for multispecialty collaboration for this patient population has never been greater. These rapid advances have inevitably left us with important gaps in knowledge for which definitive answers will only become available in several years. To this end, the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer commissioned a diverse multidisciplinary international expert panel to evaluate the current landscape and provide diagnostic, staging, and therapeutic recommendations for patients with rNSCLC, with particular emphasis on patients with American Joint Committee on Cancer-Union for International Cancer Control TNM eighth edition stages II and III disease. Using a team-based approach, we generated 19 recommendations, of which all but one achieved greater than 85% consensus among panel members. A public voting process was initiated, which successfully validated and provided qualitative nuance to our recommendations. Highlights include the following: (1) the critical importance of a multidisciplinary approach to the evaluation of patients with rNSCLC driven by shared clinical decision-making of a multispecialty team of expert providers; (2) biomarker testing for rNSCLC; (3) a preference for neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy for stage III rNSCLC; (4) equipoise regarding the optimal management of patients with stage II between upfront surgery followed by adjuvant therapy and neoadjuvant or perioperative strategies; and (5) the robust preference for adjuvant targeted therapy for patients with rNSCLC and sensitizing EGFR and ALK tumor alterations. Our primary goals were to provide practical recommendations sensitive to the global differences in biology and resources for patients with rNSCLC and to provide expert consensus guidance tailored to the individualized patient needs, goals, and preferences in their cancer care journey as these are areas where physicians must make daily clinical decisions in the absence of definitive data. These recommendations will continue to evolve as the treatment landscape for rNSCLC expands and more knowledge is acquired on the best therapeutic approach in specific patient and disease subgroups.

TI  - Predictors, surrogate, and patient-reported outcomes in immunotherapy and salvage surgery for unresectable lung cancer: a single-center retrospective study
T2  - UPDATES IN SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Medical treatment has changed drastically in recent years, especially for advanced stages of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), for which the development of immunotherapy and molecular targeted therapy significantly increased survival and quality of life. This single-center retrospective study aimed to analyze the outcome predictors, the surrogate outcomes, and the patient-reported outcomes after neoadjuvant immunotherapy for initially unresectable NSCLC. Patients affected by an initially unresectable NSCLC and identified between March 2014 and December 2021 who received immunotherapy alone or in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy were collected. Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were estimated according to the Kaplan-Meier method. Patient-reported outcomes were recorded using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality-of-Life (QoL) Group questionnaire-Lung Cancer 29 Module to compare differences in symptoms and QoL at two different times, 30 days and 1 year after surgery. Surgical, pathological records, and patient-reported outcomes (at 30 days and 1 year after surgery) were reviewed. Complete pathological remission was achieved in 7 patients (36.8%) and major pathological remission in 3 patients (15.7%). The median overall survival in the study group is 19 months (range: 2-57.4). Of 19 patients, 16 (84.2%) are alive to date, of which 2 (10.5%) have a local recurrence. At 30 days from surgery, the main symptoms reported by EORTC Module were coughing, shortness of breath, the side effect of treatment, fear of progression, and surgery-related problems. Induction immunotherapy with or without chemotherapy can be considered for unresectable locally advanced NSCLC, and after the downstaging, the possibility of surgery could be re-evaluated in a multidisciplinary setting with high rates of R0 resection. In this selected and highly motivated group of patients, the QoL and symptoms after salvage surgeries are acceptable and even better than those reported in the literature.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - AimTo compare the efficacy and safety of radiotherapy in combination with immunotherapy after achieving disease control from the first-line combination therapy of platinum-based chemotherapy and immunotherapy for advanced lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). MethodsThis study retrospectively evaluated the patients with advanced LUSC treated with the combination of radiotherapy with immunotherapy and chemotherapy (ICRT group, n = 52) or immunotherapy and chemotherapy (ICT group, n = 63) as the first-line treatment from April 2018 to April 2022. Using propensity score matching (PSM), 50 pairs were created, while the confounders and bias were controlled. The objective response rate (ORR), duration of overall response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and adverse events were analyzed in the two groups. The PFS and OS were re-analyzed separately for patients treated with thoracic radiotherapy. ResultsAfter PSM, the median PFS (12.23 vs. 7.43 months; P <0.001) and median OS (19.7 vs. 12.9 months; P <0.001) were significantly longer in the ICRT group than those in the ICT group. Both the PFS and OS rates were also significantly higher in the ICRT group than those in the ICT group, except for the OS rates in the 6th and 12th months. The mDOR of the ICRT group patients (17.10 vs. 8.27 months; P <0.001) was significantly higher than that of the ICT group patients. The median PFS, median OS, and local control rate were significantly longer in the thoracic radiotherapy group than in the control group. Radiation pneumonia was the most common adverse effect after radiotherapy; however, no treatment-related deaths occurred. The Cox regression analysis showed that ECOG scores 0-1, presence of necrosis in the tumor, radiotherapy, and optimal efficacy better than the stable disease (SD) were independent factors, affecting the PFS, while the patients with recurrent post-operative, pre-treatment NLR, radiotherapy, and optimal efficacy better than SD were the independent factors, affecting the OS. ConclusionsThe combination of radiotherapy with systematic immunotherapy and chemotherapy for the advanced LUSC was effective with tolerable adverse effects.

TI  - Immunotherapy (excluding checkpoint inhibitors) for stage I to III non-small cell lung cancer treated with surgery or radiotherapy with curative intent
T2  - COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - BackgroundNon-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common lung cancer, accounting for approximately 80% to 85% of all cases. For patients with localised NSCLC (stages I to III), it has been speculated that immunotherapy may be helpful for reducing postoperative recurrence rates, or improving the clinical outcomes of current treatment for unresectable tumours. While several new agents have now entered phase III clinical trials, we felt a systematic review was needed to address the question of the effectiveness and safety of immunotherapy in patients with stages I to III NSCLC.ObjectivesTo evaluate the effectiveness and safety of immunotherapy (excluding checkpoint inhibitors) in patients with localised NSCLC (stages I to III) who received surgery or radiotherapy with curative intent.Search methodsWe searched the following databases (from inception to 20 January 2017): CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL, and five trial registers. We also manually checked abstracts or reports from relevant conference proceedings and the reference lists of included trials.Selection criteriaWe searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in adults (>= 18 years) with histologically-confirmed early-stage (stages I to III) NSCLC after surgical resection, and those with unresectable locally advanced stage III NSCLC who had received radiotherapy with curative intent. For patients who had received primary surgical treatment, postoperative radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy was allowed if it was used for both experimental and control groups.Data collection and analysisTwo review authors independently selected eligible trials, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. We used survival analysis to pool time-to-event data, expressing the intervention effect as a hazard ratio (HR). We calculated risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous data, and mean differences for continuous data, with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Due to clinical heterogeneity (immunotherapeutic agents with different underlying mechanisms), we used random-effects models for our meta-analyses.Main resultsWe identified nine eligible trials that randomised 4940 participants, who had received surgical resection or curative radiotherapy, to either an immunotherapy group or a control group. Included immunological interventions were active immunotherapy (i.e. Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG)), adoptive cell transfer (i.e. transfer factor (TF), tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), dendritic cell-cytokine induced killer (DC-CIK), and antigen-specific cancer vaccines (melanoma-associated antigen 3 (MAGE-A3) and L-BLP25). Except for one small trial, which provided insufficient information for risk assessment, we assessed five studies at high risk of bias for at least one of the seven biases studied; we considered the risk of bias in the other three trials to be low. We included data from seven of the nine trials in the meta-analyses (4695 participants). We pooled data from 3693 participants from the three high quality RCTs to evaluate overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). We found a small, but not statistically significant, improvement in OS (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.06; P = 0.35), and PFS (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.07; P = 0.19; high-quality evidence). The addition of immunotherapy resulted in a small, but not statistically significant, increased risk of having any adverse event (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.37; P = 0.11, three trials, 3955 evaluated participants, moderate-quality evidence), or severe adverse events (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.39; four trials, 4362 evaluated participants; low-quality evidence).We analysed data from six studies for one-, two-, and three-year survival rates (4265 participants), and from six studies for five-year survival rates (4234 participants). We observed no clear between-group differences (low-quality evidence for one-and two-year survival rates, and moderate-quality evidence for three-and five-year survival rate).No trial reported the overall response rates; only one trial provided health-related quality of life results.Authors' conclusionsThe current literature does not provide evidence that suggests a survival benefit from adding immunotherapy (excluding checkpoint inhibitors) to conventional curative surgery or radiotherapy, for patients with localisedNSCLC (stages I to III). The addition of vaccine-based immunotherapy might increase the risk of adverse events. Several ongoing trials with immune checkpoints inhibitors (PD-1/PD-L1) might bring new insights for role of immunotherapy for patients with stages I to III NSCLC.

TI  - Narrative review of emerging roles for AKT-mTOR signaling in cancer radioimmunotherapy
T2  - ANNALS OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Objective: To summarize the roles of AKT-mTOR signaling in the regulation of the DNA damage response and PD-L1 expression in cancer cells, and propose a novel strategy of targeting AKT-mTOR signaling in combination with radioimmunotherapy in the era of cancer immunotherapyBackground: Immunotherapy has greatly improved the clinical outcomes of many cancer patients and has changed the landscape of cancer patient management. However, only a small subgroup of cancer patients (similar to 20-30%) benefit from immune checkpoint blockade-based immunotherapy. The current challenge is to find biomarkers to predict the response of patients to immunotherapy and strategies to sensitize patients to immunotherapy.Methods: Search and review the literature which were published in PUBMED from 2000-2021 with the key words mTOR, AKT, drug resistance, DNA damage response, immunotherapy, PD-L1, DNA repair, radioimmunotherapy.Conclusions: More than 50% of cancer patients receive radiotherapy during their course of treatment. Radiotherapy has been shown to reduce the growth of locally irradiated tumors as well as metastatic non irradiated tumors (abscopal effects) by affecting systemic immunity. Consistently, immunotherapy has been demonstrated to enhance radiotherapy with more than one hundred clinical trials of radiation in combination with immunotherapy (radioimmunotherapy) across cancer types. Nevertheless, current available data have shown limited efficacy of trials testing radioimmunotherapy. AKT-mTOR signaling is a major tumor growth-promoting pathway and is upregulated in most cancers. AKT-mTOR signaling is activated by growth factors as well as genotoxic stresses including radiotherapy. Importantly, recent advances have shown that AKT-mTOR is one of the main signaling pathways that regulate DNA damage repair as well as PD-L1 levels in cancers. These recent advances clearly suggest a novel cancer therapy strategy by targeting AKTmTOR signaling in combination with radioimmunotherapy.

TI  - Complete pathologic response to short-course neoadjuvant alectinib in mediastinal node positive (N2) <i>ALK </i>rearranged lung cancer
T2  - LUNG CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Neoadjuvant therapy prior to surgical resection for locally advanced lung cancer has evolved to incorporate systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy +/-immunotherapy +/-radiotherapy. The role of neoadjuvant precision therapies remains understudied. Materials and Methods: We report cases with major and complete pathologic responses to off-label neoadjuvant alectinib. Results: A case with stage IIIA (cT1b cN2 cM0) EML4-ALK variant 3a/b lung adenocarcinoma received 6 weeks of alectinib followed by R0 left upper lobectomy with complete pathological response (ypT0 ypN0). Another case with stage IIIA (cT3 cN2 cM0) EML4-ALK variant 2 received 12 weeks of alectinib followed by R0 right middle lobectomy with a major pathologic response (ypT1a ypN0) but systemic recurrence 12 months post-operatively. Conclusion: Ongoing clinical trials are evaluating the role of both neoadjuvant and adjuvant ALK-directed therapy. Our cases support the completion of ongoing trials (ALINA: NCT03456076 and ALNEO: NCT05015010), and highlight the ability of second generation ALK inhibitors to induce major and complete pathologic responses in the neoadjuvant setting plus the likely role of long-term adjuvant kinase inhibitor therapy to prevent radiographic/clinical recurrence.

TI  - Bone metastases in non-small cell lung cancer: a narrative review
T2  - JOURNAL OF THORACIC DISEASE
M3  - Review
AB  - Background and Objective: Bone metastases are common in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and remain a significant source of morbidity, mortality, and diminished quality of life, despite the considerable progress made in the overall management of patients with metastatic NSCLC over the last decade. Understanding the molecular pathogenesis of bone metastases is critical to improving survival, preserving function, and managing symptoms in this patient population. The objective of our review is to provide a comprehensive review of the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, management, and factors predicting the development and prognosis of patients with NSCLC with bone metastases. Methods: An online electronic search was performed on PubMed and Google Scholar of all English language literature using combinations of the following keywords: bone metastases, non-small cell lung cancer, pathophysiology, skeletal related events, response to therapy, predictive factors, and immunotherapy. Bibliographies of identified papers were reviewed for additional articles of interest. Observational cohort, retrospective studies, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), meta-analyses, and review articles were examined for this review. Key Content and Findings: Bone metastases in lung cancer patients remain a common occurrence, impacting morbidity, mortality, and quality of life. Patients with skeletal related events (SREs) have worse prognosis. There is data supporting use of bisphosphonates and/or denosumab, and these should be considered in all patients with bone metastases. Novel studies comparing the genomic alterations of skeletal metastases and primary tumors are needed. As therapy for patients with advanced disease evolves, more studies are needed to evaluate the interplay between immunotherapy and bone metastases, and in determining the response to treatment in bone. Conclusions: Predicting development and progression of bone metastases could allow earlier and targeted therapy in patients with bone metastases. Predicting and evaluating response to conventional chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors in NSCLC patients with bone metastases remains an unmet need and merits further study.

TI  - Overcoming Hypoxic Resistance in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer By Targeting Mitochondrial Metabolism
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - PROJECT SUMMARYMany groups are investigating why some lung cancer patients respond well to radio- and immuno-therapies andsome do not. One variable is tumor hypoxia, and many groups have shown it can significantly inhibit theeffectiveness to these therapeutic modalities. Clinical studies have identified hypoxia as an independentprognostic indicator of poor patient outcomes, but even though this connection has been known for decades, noFDA-approved intervention exists to clinically overcome hypoxia. Some investigators have tried to deliver moreoxygen to the tumor, but this approach remains constrained due to the poorly formed tumor vasculature. Wehave taken an innovative approach and asked if we can reduce demand for, rather than increase supply of,oxygen to reduce hypoxia. We have found that the FDA-approved vasorelaxant papaverine (PPV) has an off-target ability to inhibit mitochondrial complex 1, and reduce oxygen consumption rapidly, in low micromolarconcentrations in every cell line tested in vitro. We have also shown that PPV can enhance the effectiveness ofradiation and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in preclinical models of lung and other cancers, withoutsensitizing well-oxygenated normal tissue. Reducing hypoxia reverses immune privilege, decreases terminally-exhausted T cells, and increases progenitors that are responsive to PD-1 blockade. We have more recentlydeveloped new derivatives of PPV that have lost their vasorelaxant capability and increased their duration ofaction so that they can be improved immuno-sensitizers. We now propose to test the hypothesis that PPV caneffectively enhance the radio- and immuno-therapeutic treatment of preclinical models of lung cancer, and thatit is feasible to add PPV to standard of care therapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We haveexamined TCGA databases and found that lung cancer driver mutations in the KEAP1/NRF2 pathway lead tohigh levels of mitochondrial gene expression that can cause elevated oxygen metabolism contributing to hypoxia.In Aim 1, we will investigate the effects of oncogenic NRF2 activation human and murine cells and model tumorsto determine the dependence of these cells on mitochondrial function, how increased oxygen metabolismcontributes to tumor hypoxia, and if therapy-refractory tumors are sensitized by PPV or its derivatives. In Aim 2,we will examine the effect of tumor hypoxia on the migration and activation of T-cells in model tumors and howthe immune infiltrate changes after reduction of hypoxia with PPV or its derivatives. Finally, in Aim 3 we willperform a phase 1 clinical trial to determine if the addition of PPV is feasible for patients receiving standard ofcare chemoradiation followed by immunotherapy for advanced NSCLC. We will look for effectiveness in changingtumor oxygenation using paired blood level oxygen determination (BOLD) MRIs, and for changes in immunepopulations of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. These studies will let us know if, and how, to use PPV or itsnovel derivatives in future clinical trials for the treatment of NSCLC.

TI  - Concurrent chemoradiotherapy for stage III non-small-cell lung cancer: recent progress and future perspectives (a narrative review)
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL LUNG CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CHRT) remains the therapeutic standard for locally advanced inoperable non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The median overall survival (OS) with this approach is in the range of 20?30 months, with five-year survival of approximately 30%. These outcomes have recently been further improved by supplementing CHRT with maintenance durvalumab, a monoclonal anti-PD-L1 agent. The progress in treatment outcomes of locally advanced NSCLC before the era of immunotherapy has been achieved mainly by virtue of developments in diagnostics and radiotherapy techniques. Routine implementation of endoscopic and endobronchial ultrasonography for mediastinal lymph nodes assessment, positron emission tomography/computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain allows for more accurate staging of NSCLC and for optimizing treatment strategy. Thorough staging and respiratory motion control allows for higher conformity of radiotherapy and reduction of radiotherapy related toxicity. Dose escalation with prolonged overall treatment time does not improve treatment outcomes of CHRT. In consequence, 60 Gy in 2 Gy fractions or equivalent biological dose remains the standard dose for definitive CHRT in locally advanced NSCLC. However, owing to increased toxicity of CHRT, this option may not be applicable in a proportion of elderly or frail patients. This article summarizes recent developments in curative CHRT for inoperable stage III NSCLC, and presents perspectives for further improvements of this strategy

AB  - Small cell lung cancer (SCLC), which accounts for about 15% of lung cancer cases, is an aggressive disease characterized by rapid growth and early widespread metastasis. Despite sensitive to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, SCLC is vulnerable to get resistant and has high recurrence rates. Therefore, novel therapies are desperately needed to improve treatment efficacy and increase overall survival. A complex molecular biological alteration of SCLC accounts for its pathogenesis and chemo-resistance. With the understanding of SCLC biologic behavior and improvement of detection technique, immunotherapy may be a viable therapeutic approach and bring breakthrough to the treatment of patients with SCLC. In this review, we will discuss the rationale for immunotherapy and recent clinical trials of immunotherapeutic agents for SCLC.

AB  - Immune checkpoint blockades including monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4), programmed death-1 (PD-1), and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) have been emerged as a promising anticancer therapy. Several immune checkpoint blockades have been approved by US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and have shown notable success in clinical trials for patients with advanced melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer. Radiotherapy is a promising combination partner of immune checkpoint blockades due to its potent pro-immune effect. This review will cover the current issue and the future perspectives for combined with radiotherapy and immune checkpoint blockades based upon the available preclinical and clinical data.

AB  - To evaluate the role of endobronchial chemo - immunotherapy (ECIT) we studied 68 patients with Stage III non - resectable lung cancer (LC) from February 1990 to March 1997: 13 patients had Stage IIIA, 55 patients - Stage IIIB, 27 patients - small - cell lung cancer (SCLC) and 41 patient - non - small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). All the patients were broken into two chemoradiotherapy (CRT) treatment arms: the control group - combination cisplatin - based chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide + vincristinum + doxonrbicin + methotrexatum + cisplatin) given together with sequential or concurrent radiation therapy (RT), and the study group - the same CRT regimen plus endobronchial administration of chemotherapeutic agents via a microtracheostomy catheter. A split - course of RT was delivered as a conventional daily fractionation schedule with 2Gy/fraction 5 times/week/30Gy repeated with a 4-week interruption up to a total dose of 60Gy. Objective partial tumor regression after 2 courses of CT and 60 Gy RT was noted in: NSCLC - in 13 (48%) of 27 patients in study group and in 4 (29%) of 14 patient in control group; SCLC - in 12 (80%) of 15 patients in study group and in 7 (58%) of 12 patients in control g-roup: one complete response was observed in each group (7% and 8%, respectively). A median survival in patients with NSCLC was 20,9 month in study group vs 12,3 month in control group, and 14,4 month in study group vs 8,7 month in control group in SCLC. Thus the adjunction of ECIT to CRT in patients with non - resectable Stage IIIA lung cancer contributes towards objective tumor regression and increases a median survival time.

AB  - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACTThe Lung Cancer Program (LCP) includes 70 members (34 primary, 35 associate, 1 adjunct) from 19departments. The program is led by Dr. John Heymach, an expert in biomarker-driven clinical trials andtherapeutic targeting who oversees the program; Dr. Jack Roth, a surgeon-scientist and co-PI of the Universityof Texas Lung SPORE; and Dr. Lauren Byers, who leads the program's clinical research efforts and mentoringof trainees, fellows, and junior faculty. The major scientific goal of the LCP is to develop more effective andpersonalized approaches for the treatment of lung cancer. To achieve this goal, the program has 3 specific aimsthat focus on 3 themes: 1) lung cancer signaling and therapeutic targets; 2) targeting the immune system andmicroenvironment; and 3) the multimodal treatment of localized and advanced lung cancer. The annual directpeer-reviewed funding totals $5.7M, including an NCI Lung Cancer SPORE, a Stand Up 2 Cancer Dream TeamAward, and 3 CPRIT Multi-Investigator Research Awards. Of the total funding, $3.4M (60%) is from NCI grants.Since the last competitive renewal, total annual peer-reviewed direct-cost funding has increased by 93%. Sincethe last submission, the program has published 999 papers: 550 (55%) intra-programmatic collaborations, 355(36%) inter-programmatic collaborations, and 607 (61%) external collaborations. Forty-four percent of thepublications appeared in journals with an IF >5, and 15% appeared in journals with an IF >10, including Science,N Engl J Med, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, Cancer Discov, and Lancet Oncol. During the last grant period, programmembers had leadership roles in standard-of-care–changing studies, including the AURA3 study (establishingosimertinib for EGFR T790M–mutant NSCLC) and a study demonstrating the benefit of local consolidativetherapy for patients with oligometastatic NSCLC. Our previous findings identifying novel targets in small cell lungcancer (SCLC) have been validated in subsequent clinical studies. Members also identified 3 subsets of KRAS-mutant NSCLC based on co-occurring genomic alterations that exhibit distinct biology, patterns of immune-system engagement, and therapeutic vulnerabilities. Finally, they identified a role for epithelial-to-mesenchymaltransition in regulating tumor immunosuppression via an miR200/ZEB1/PD-L1 axis, playing a central role inpromoting NSCLC metastasis. In upcoming years, members will build on these findings to identify newapproaches to target subsets of lung cancer, with a focus on SCLC and KRAS-mutant NSCLC; investigatestrategies for enhancing antitumor immunity and mechanisms of immunotherapy resistance; and developmultidisciplinary paradigms integrating immunotherapy and targeted agents as an approach to improve thesurvival of lung cancer patients.

TI  - Enhancing Chemoradiation Efficacy through Unbiased Drug Discovery Approaches
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - A major barrier to improving cure rates in locally advanced cancers is our inability to make progress beyond whatchemoradiation (CRT) can currently deliver. Combination strategies using molecular targeted therapies with CRThold promise for improving outcomes further. While many drugs could enhance the effects of radiation alone, wehave discovered that the effects are quite unpredictable when drugs are combined with chemotherapy andradiotherapy. The successful translation of adding molecular targeted agents to CRT would require anunderstanding of the molecular pathways that enable the cancer cell to survive under conditions of CRT.Inhibiting these pathways with molecular targeted drugs will be synergistic with CRT in the cancer-specificcontext. Using a set of molecular targeted drugs from the CTEP portfolio as an initial starting point, we willinvestigate two hard-to-treat cancer types treated with CRT, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and pancreaticductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We will identify drugs that could synergize with radiation and CRT using a highthroughput clonogenic survival screen that we have developed on validated cancer lines and then test the mostclinically promising combinations of agents to multiple cell lines with varying genetic backgrounds, first in vitroand then further validated using 2 in vivo models: a panel of patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) and orthotopictumor models using syngeneic tumors, all done in combination with clinically-relevant chemotherapies. Thepharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of these drugs with chemotherapy in animals and tumors willbe assessed in order to determine the optimal sequencing approach with conventionally fractionatedradiotherapy. Since we have discovered that chemotherapy significantly alters the response of cancer cells toradiation and targeted drugs, we will also evaluate the molecular mechanisms that explain the response to CRT,and identify potential factors that may influence this response using 4 major approaches. In the first more classicapproach, we will assess DNA damage repair pathways and reactive oxygen species generation when targetedagents are combined with radiation or CRT. Second, we will use reverse phase protein arrays (RPPA) to assessthe functional proteome to determine pathways that may be altered with molecular targeted drugs in the settingof RT or CRT. In the third approach, we will use Stable Isotope Labeling with Amino Acids (SILAC) to assessglobal proteomic and phosphoproteomic changes that occur with radiation and CRT treatment, and how thesepathways could be altered with specific molecular targeted therapies. Lastly, we will use Imaging MassSpectrometry to analyze drug distribution within the various tumor models and assess how thepharmacodynamic heterogeneity impacts CRT responsiveness. Our proposal will not only identify the mostpromising drugs that could best be combined with CRT in NSCLC and PDAC, but we will have identifiedmolecular and tumor factors that confer drug resistance which will enable future development of novel targetedstrategies to enhance CRT or appropriately select patient for personalized therapy. Our approach will generatethe high quality preclinical data and novel insights to fulfill the overall FOA objective, which is “to accelerate thepace at which combined modality treatments with greater efficacy are identified and incorporated into standardpractices for treatments”.

TI  - Novel therapeutic agents in the management of brain metastases
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of reviewThis review aims to highlight the novel therapeutic agents in the management of brain metastases which are in various stages of clinical development. We review the results from recent clinical trials, publications and presentations at recent national and international conferences.Recent findingsSeveral new systemic treatment options for brain metastases are in early or advanced clinical trials. These drugs have good intracranial and extracranial activities. As lung cancer, breast cancer, and melanoma are the three most common causes of brain metastases, most agents in clinical development are focused on these tumor types. Several of these therapies are small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors or monoclonal antibodies against the tyrosine kinase receptors. Another exciting development in brain metastases management is the use of immunotherapy agents. The anti-CTLA-4 and\or anti-PD-1 antibodies have shown promising intracranial activity in melanoma and nonsmall cell lung cancer patients with brain metastases.SummaryContemporary clinical trials have shown encouraging intracranial activity of newer tyrosine kinase inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies against tyrosine kinase receptors and immunotherapy agents in select group of patients with brain metastases. Further studies are needed to develop therapeutic strategies, in order to improve survival in patients with brain metastases.

TI  - Current literature review on the tumor immune micro-environment, its heterogeneity and future perspectives in treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL LUNG CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Background and Objective: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) were a major clinical advancement that provided an opportunity to improve the prognosis of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, PD-L1 expression does not sufficiently predict ICI efficacy in NSCLC patients. In recent studies, the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) was shown to have a central role in lung cancer progression and to affect clinical outcome of patients diagnosed with lung cancer. As development of new therapeutic targets to overcome ICI resistance is a priority, understanding the TIME is important. Recently, a series of studies was conducted to target each component of TIME to improve efficacy of cancer treatment. In this review, important features related to TIME, its heterogeneity and current trends in treatment targeting the component of TIME are discussed. Methods: PubMed and PMC were searched from January 1st, 2012 to August 16th, 2022 using the following key words: "NSCLC", "Tumor microenvironment", "Immune", "Metastasis" and "Heterogeneity" Key Content and Findings: Heterogeneity in the TIME can be either spatial or temporal. Subsequent to heterogeneous changes in the TIME, treatment of lung cancer can be more challenging because drug resistance is more likely to occur. In terms of the TIME, the main concept for increasing the chance of successful NSCLC treatment is to activate immune responses against tumor cells and inhibit immunosuppressive activities. In addition, relevant research is focused on normalizing an otherwise aberrant TIME in NSCLC patients. Potential therapeutic targets include immune cells, cytokine interactions, and non-immune cells such as fibroblasts or vessels. Conclusions: In management of lung cancer, understanding TIME and its heterogeneity is significant to treatment outcomes. Ongoing trials including various treatment modalities such as radiotherapy, cytotoxic chemotherapy, and anti-angiogenic treatment and regimens inhibiting other immunoinhibitory molecules are promising.

T2  - ONCOLOGY IN CLINICAL PRACTICE
M3  - Review
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Over the past years, tremendous progress has been made in the treatment available for non-small cell lung cancer patients (NSCLC), both in the early and advanced stages of the disease. In early-stage NSCLC, perioperative immunotherapy is emerging as a promising approach. Several studies in preoperative chemoimmunotherapy showed a significant increase in the rate of complete pathologic response and prolonged event-free survival in resectable NSCLC patients. Similarly, atezolizumab and osimertinib are the standard of care in some patients after complete resection in EGFR-mutated or programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) high-expressing tumors. In locally advanced disease, durvalumab consolidation therapy following chemoradiotherapy improved progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in unresectable NSCLC while other immunotherapies in combination with chemotherapy showed promising results. In advanced NSCLC, novel immunotherapies or immunoconjugates such as trastuzumab deruxtecan are also demonstrating efficacy. Furthermore, molecularly targeted therapy targeting KRAS, , EGFR, , and other genetic aberrations, guided by next-generation sequencing, offers new treatment options. However, challenges remain, including patient selection, sequencing, and reimbursement. This article reviews the latest treatments for patients with NSCLC in the early and advanced stages of the disease.

TI  - Novel imaging biomarkers predict outcomes in stage III unresectable non-small cell lung cancer treated with chemoradiation and durvalumab
T2  - JOURNAL FOR IMMUNOTHERAPY OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The landmark study of durvalumab as consolidation therapy in NSCLC patients (PACIFIC trial) demonstrated significantly longer progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with locally advanced, unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with durvalumab (immunotherapy, IO) therapy after chemoradiotherapy (CRT). In clinical practice in the USA, durvalumab continues to be used in patients across all levels of programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression. While immune therapies have shown promise in several cancers, some patients either do not respond to the therapy or have cancer recurrence after an initial response. It is not clear so far who will benefit of this therapy or what the mechanisms behind treatment failure are. Methods A total of 133 patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC who underwent durvalumab after CRT or CRT alone were included. Patients treated with durvalumab IO after CRT were randomly split into training (D1=59) and test (D2=59) sets and the remaining 15 patients treated with CRT alone were grouped in D3. Radiomic textural patterns from within and around the target nodules were extracted. A radiomic risk score (RRS) was built and was used to predict PFS and overall survival (OS). Patients were divided into high-risk and low-risk groups based on median RRS. Results RRS was found to be significantly associated with PFS in D1 (HR=2.67, 95% CI 1.85 to 4.13, p<0.05, C-index=0.78) and D2 (HR=2.56, 95% CI 1.63 to 4, p<0.05, C-index=0.73). Similarly, RRS was associated with OS in D1 (HR=1.89, 95% CI 1.3 to 2.75, p<0.05, C-index=0.67) and D2 (HR=2.14, 95% CI 1.28 to 3.6, p<0.05, C-index=0.69), respectively. RRS was found to be significantly associated with PFS in high PD-L1 (HR=3.01, 95% CI 1.41 to 6.45, p=0.0044) and low PD-L1 (HR=2.74, 95% CI 1.8 to 4.14, p=1.77e-06) groups. Moreover, RRS was not significantly associated with OS in the high PD-L1 group (HR=2.08, 95% CI 0.98 to 4.4, p=0.054) but was significantly associated with OS in the low PD-L1 group (HR=1.61, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.28, p=0.0062). In addition, RRS was significantly associated with PFS (HR=2.77, 95% CI 1.17 to 6.52, p=0.019, C-index=0.77) and OS (HR=2.62, 95% CI 1.25 to 5.51, p=0.01, C-index=0.77) in D3, respectively. Conclusions Tumor radiomics of pretreatment CT images from patients with stage III unresectable NSCLC were prognostic of PFS and OS to CRT followed by durvalumab IO and CRT alone.

During the last grant period, programmembers had leadership roles in standard-of-care–changing studies, including the AURA3 study (establishingosimertinib for EGFR T790M–mutant NSCLC) and a study demonstrating the benefit of local consolidativetherapy for patients with oligometastatic NSCLC. Our previous findings identifying novel targets in small cell lungcancer (SCLC) have been validated in subsequent clinical studies. Members also identified 3 subsets of KRAS-mutant NSCLC based on co-occurring genomic alterations that exhibit distinct biology, patterns of immune-system engagement, and therapeutic vulnerabilities. Finally, they identified a role for epithelial-to-mesenchymaltransition in regulating tumor immunosuppression via an miR200/ZEB1/PD-L1 axis, playing a central role inpromoting NSCLC metastasis. In upcoming years, members will build on these findings to identify newapproaches to target subsets of lung cancer, with a focus on SCLC and KRAS-mutant NSCLC; investigatestrategies for enhancing antitumor immunity and mechanisms of immunotherapy resistance; and developmultidisciplinary paradigms integrating immunotherapy and targeted agents as an approach to improve thesurvival of lung cancer patients.

TI  - Integrating immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeted therapies in the treatment of early stage non-small cell lung cancer: a narrative review
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL LUNG CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Prognosis of early stage non-small cell lung cancer (eNSCLC) is poor even when treated radically with surgery and (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy (Cht). The discovery of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for oncogene addicted NSCLC and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionised the therapeutic paradigm and improved survival of advanced NSCLC. The unprecedented impact of these drugs has shifted the focus of investigation to early stage disease aiming at improving cure. In this context, several single arm phase II studies evaluating neoadjuvant ICI alone or in combination with platinum-based Cht have shown encouraging rates of pathological response which have spurred several ongoing randomized trials with (neo)adjuvant ICI. More recently, ADAURA study evaluating adjuvant osimertinib demonstrated a profound reduction of the risk of recurrence in patients with stage I (>4 cm)-IIIA eNSCLC harbouring EGFR sensitizing mutations. ICIs and TKIs represent a true revolution in the treatment of eNSCLC call to challenge the current standard of care. However, questions regarding drug resistance, recurrence patterns, biomarker identification, optimal treatment duration and sequencing need be answered to effectively integrate new drugs in the rapidly evolving therapeutic landscape of NSCLC. In this review we critically review new developments and future perspectives of TKIs and ICI as (neo)adjuvant strategies for eNSCLC.

TI  - Association between immune-related adverse events and the efficacy of PD-1 inhibitors in advanced esophageal cancer
T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionRecent developments in immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have improved the treatment outcomes of esophageal cancer (EC); however, it may initiate immune-related adverse events (irAEs) in some patients. The ICIs' therapeutic efficacy is associated with irAEs in patients with non-small cell lung cancer or renal cell carcinoma, although this association is unknown in EC. The purpose of this study was to explore the association between irAEs and the efficacy of programmed death 1 (PD-1) inhibitors in EC patients. Patients and methodsThis study included patients with advanced EC treated with PD-1 inhibitors. The patients were divided into two groups according to the occurrence of irAEs. Afterward, the efficacy was compared between the irAE-negative and irAE-positive groups, and we analyzed the predictive factors of irAEs and survival. ResultsOverall, 295 patients were included in this study. Baseline characteristics were balanced in the irAE-negative and irAE-positive groups. In total, 143 (48.47%) patients experienced irAEs. The most frequent irAEs were anemia (49, 16.61%), hyperthyroidism (45, 15.25%), and pneumonitis (44, 14.92%). In total, 33 (11.19%) patients had grade >= 3 irAEs and pneumonitis have 15 (5.08%). No grade 5 adverse events were observed. A total of 52 (17.63%) and 91 (30.85%) patients had single and multiple irAEs, respectively. Compared with patients without irAEs, those with irAEs had significantly higher objective response rate (ORR) (37.76% vs. 25.00%, p = 0.018) and disease control rate (DCR) (92.31% vs. 83.55%, p = 0.022). Univariate Cox analyses indicated the significant association between irAEs and improved median progression-free survival (PFS) (10.27 vs. 6.2 months, p < 0.001) and overall survival (OS) (15.4 vs. 9.2 months, p < 0.001). In multivariate analyses, irAEs were independently associated with longer PFS (p = 0.011) and OS (p = 0.002). Moreover, multivariate analysis revealed that cycles > 8, radiation, as well as antiangiogenic therapy were strongly associated with irAEs development (p < 0.001, p = 0.002, and p = 0.025, respectively). ConclusionIn advanced EC, patients with irAEs showed markedly better efficacy in ORR, DCR, PFS, and OS compared with patients without irAEs.

TI  - Efficiency and safety of neoadjuvant PD-1 inhibitor (sintilimab) combined with chemotherapy in potentially resectable stage IIIA/IIIB non-small cell lung cancer: Neo-Pre-IC, a single-arm phase 2 trial
T2  - ECLINICALMEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Some locally advanced (IIIA/IIIB) non -small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) might have surgical options available. However, information regarding the effectiveness of neoadjuvant immunotherapy for potentially resectable IIIA/IIIB NSCLC is limited. The intent of this investigation was to offer a more favourable alternative to the standard approach of chemoradiotherapy (concurrent or sequential chemoradiotherapy) followed by immunotherapy for potentially resectable stage III NSCLC. Methods This prospective, single -arm, phase 2 clinical trial (NCT04326153) enrolled treatment -naive patients with 'potentially resectable' IIIA/IIIB NSCLC who were deemed unsuitable for complete (R0) resection upon initial diagnosis. The study period was between March 20, 2020, and August 20, 2021. Patients underwent neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy (sintilimab combined with nab-paclitaxel and carboplatin) for two to three cycles prior to surgical resection of the lung carcinoma and systematic nodal dissection within 30-45 days. The primary endpoint was the 2 -year disease -free survival (DFS) rate, with secondary endpoints encompassing major pathological response (MPR) rate, pathological complete response (pCR) rate, overall survival, objective response rate (ORR), downstaging rate, and adverse events (AEs). Tumour immune cell infiltrates, identified via immunohistochemistry, were assessed as biomarkers at baseline and after surgery. Findings Among 30 patients who received neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy, 20 underwent complete resection. The disease control rate was 96.7% (95% CI: 90.3%-99.99%), with an ORR of 55% (95% CI: 37.2%-72.8%) and a downstaging rate of 80% (95% CI: 65.7%-94.3%). In the subgroup of 20 patients who underwent surgery, the MPR rate was 65% (95% CI: 43.3%-82.9%), and the pCR rate was 40% (95% CI: 21.2%-46.3%). The 2 -year DFS rate in the surgical group was 75% (95% CI 56%-94%). Notably, the MPR group demonstrated significantly prolonged DFS compared with the non-MPR group (p = 0.00024). A significant increase in pretreatment CD8 expression correlated with improved DFS (p = 0.00019). Three patients (10%) experienced grade 3 or higher immune -related AEs-one case of grade 3 elevated myocardial enzymes, one case of grade 3 interstitial pneumonia, and one case of grade 5 bronchopleural fistula. Interpretation Neoadjuvant immunotherapy markedly enhanced the rate of pathological response and 2 -year DFS in patients with potentially resectable IIIA/IIIB NSCLC. Overexpression of CD8 before treatment (H score >= 3) may serve as a potential predictive biomarker for DFS. Consequently, the treatment landscape for potentially resectable IIIA/ IIIB NSCLC could undergo changes. Funding This study did not receive any financial support. Copyright (c) 2024 The Authors.

TI  - Effects of antibiotics on immunotherapy in patients with metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer.
T2  - European journal of cancer prevention : the official journal of the European Cancer Prevention Organisation (ECP)
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - To investigate the effects of antibiotic exposure on the prognosis of patients with advanced metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (m-NSCLC) who received immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). This study retrospectively included 199 patients diagnosed with m-NSCLC in Shandong Cancer Hospital and Institute from December 2017 to October 2021, all patients received ICIs for the first time. The basic clinical characteristics of patients before the first treatment of ICIs, whether antibiotics were used during treatment, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were collected. The survival among different groups was compared by the Kaplan-Meier method. The median follow-up time of m-NSCLC patients was 33.79months, mPFS was 11.67months, and mOS was 21.55months. Univariate analysis showed that antibiotic use, radiotherapy, and targeted drug resistance influenced PFS and OS (P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that antibiotic use, radiotherapy, and targeted resistance remained independent factors of PFS, and targeted resistance was an independent factor of OS (P < 0.05). Subgroup analysis found that antibiotic use within 30days before and after immunotherapy could decrease the PFS and OS (P < 0.05). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients without radiotherapy had shorter PFS (mPFS, 12.89 vs. 8.13months; P = 0.0258) and OS (mOS, 26.94 vs. 16.43months; P = 0.0465). The mPFS (16.17 vs. 9.19months; P = 0.0151) and mOS (27.27 vs. 18.65months; P = 0.0437) of patients in the antibiotic group were shorter. Patients in the targeted drug-resistant group had shorter PFS (mPFS, 40.66 vs. 7.77months, P < 0.001) and OS (mOS, 41.98 vs. 16.89months, P < 0.001) compared with patients who did not receive targeted treatment. Antibiotics and radiation therapy are associated with the prognosis of m-NSCLC who are newly treated with ICIs. Effectively reducing antibiotic use in 1month before and after ICIs treatment may help improve the immunotherapy efficacy of patients with m-NSCLC.

M3  - Review
AB  - In recent years, the total 5-year survival rate of the patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains unsatisfactory, though there are some recent advances in the survival rate of the patients with NSCLC because of the advances in surgery, irradiation, chemotherapy and targeted therapy. The immunotherapy which utilizes the immune system to control, kill and eradicate cancer cell is a viable treatment approach for cancer. Recent advances in our understanding of cancer immunology and molecular biology resulted in the development of non-antigen specific immunotherapy, for example, monoclonal antibodies targeting immune checkpoints on the T-cell lymphocyte. Not only non-antigen specific immunotherapy, but also the antigen specific immunotherapy or vaccination have made great progress. This makes them become promising therapeutic agents. Herein, we review the recent progress and advances of tumor vaccine from randomized controlled trials.

TI  - Correlation of K<SUP>trans</SUP> derived from dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI with treatment response and survival in locally advanced NSCLC patients undergoing induction immunochemotherapy and concurrent chemoradiotherapy
T2  - JOURNAL FOR IMMUNOTHERAPY OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose This study aimed to investigate the prognostic significance of pretreatment dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI parameters concerning tumor response following induction immunochemotherapy and survival outcomes in patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who underwent immunotherapy-based multimodal treatments. Material and methods Unresectable stage III NSCLC patients treated by induction immunochemotherapy, concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) with or without consolidative immunotherapy from two prospective clinical trials were screened. Using the two-compartment Extend Tofts model, the parameters including K-trans, K-ep, V-e, and V-p were calculated from DCE-MRI data. The apparent diffusion coefficient was calculated from diffusion-weighted-MRI data. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the curve (AUC) were used to assess the predictive performance of MRI parameters. The Cox regression model was used for univariate and multivariate analysis. Results 111 unresectable stage III NSCLC patients were enrolled. Patients received two cycles of induction immunochemotherapy and CCRT, with or without consolidative immunotherapy. With the median follow-up of 22.3 months, the median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 16.3 and 23.8 months. The multivariate analysis suggested that Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score, TNM stage and the response to induction immunochemotherapy were significantly related to both PFS and OS. After induction immunochemotherapy, 67 patients (59.8%) achieved complete response or partial response and 44 patients (40.2%) had stable disease or progressive disease. The K-trans of primary lung tumor before induction immunochemotherapy yielded the best performance in predicting the treatment response, with an AUC of 0.800. Patients were categorized into two groups: high-K-trans group (n=67, K-trans > 164.3x10(-3)/min) and low-K-trans group (n=44, K-trans <= 164.3x10(-3)/min) based on the ROC analysis. The high-K-trans group had a significantly higher objective response rate than the low-K-trans group (85.1% (57/67) vs 22.7% (10/44), p<0.001). The high-K-trans group also presented better PFS (median: 21.1 vs 11.3 months, p=0.002) and OS (median: 34.3 vs 15.6 months, p=0.035) than the low-K-trans group. Conclusions Pretreatment K-trans value emerged as a significant predictor of the early response to induction immunochemotherapy and survival outcomes in unresectable stage III NSCLC patients who underwent immunotherapy-based multimodal treatments. Elevated K-trans values correlated positively with enhanced treatment response, leading to extended PFS and OS durations.

M3  - Review
AB  - The management of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has been revolutionized in recent years with the introduction of biomarker-targeted molecular therapies and immune checkpoint inhibitors. In contrast, since adjuvant chemotherapy was first established twenty years ago as the standard of care, little has changed for resected early-stage (IB-IIIA) patients for whom the potential for cure is greatest. In this manuscript we will review recently presented data as well as ongoing/planned studies in this arena. So far, investigative efforts have yielded mixed results regarding the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in early-stage NSCLC, though a series of now better planned, biomarker-driven ongoing phase III trials may be more informative. Several innovative immunotherapy studies have already shown promising results principally in the neoadjuvant setting with a large number of pivotal neo-adjuvant and adjuvant trials now in progress. Given the more robust design and biomarker-focused approach of the new generation of studies, significant advances in the optimal curative treatment of early stage NSCLC are anticipated.

TI  - Surgical or medical strategy for locally-advanced, stage IIIA/B-N2 non-small cell lung cancer: Reproducibility of decision-making at a multidisciplinary tumor board
T2  - LUNG CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Stage IIIA/B-N2 is a very heterogeneous group of patients and accounts for one third of NSCLC at diagnosis. The best treatment strategy is established at a Multidisciplinary Tumor Board (MTB): surgical resection with neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy versus definitive chemoradiation with immune checkpoint inhibitors consolidation. Despite the crucial role of MTBs in this complex setting, limited data is available regarding its performances and the reproducibility of the decision-making.Methods: Using a large cohort of IIIA/B-N2 NSCLC patients, we described patient's characteristics and treatment strategies established at the initial MTB: with a "surgical strategy" group, for potentially resectable disease, and a "medical strategy" group for non-resectable patients. A third group consisted of patients who were not eligible for surgery after neoadjuvant treatment and switched from the surgical to the medical strategy. We randomly selected 30 cases (10 in each of the 3 groups) for a blinded re-discussion at a fictive MTB and analyzed the reproducibility and factors associated with treatment decision.Results: Ninety-seven IIIA/B-N2 NSCLC patients were enrolled between June 2017 and December 2019. The initial MTB opted for a medical or a surgical strategy in 44% and 56% of patients respectively. We identified histology, tumor size and localization, extent of lymph node involvement and the presence of bulky mediastinal nodes as key decision-making factors. Thirteen patients were not eligible for surgical resection after neoadjuvant therapy and switched for a medical strategy. Overall concordance between the initial decision and the re discussion was 70%. The kappa correlation coefficient was 0.43. Concordance was higher for patients with limited mediastinal node invasion. Survival did not appear to be impacted by conflicting decisions.Conclusions: Reproducibility of treatment decision-making for stage IIIA/B-N2 NSCLC patients at a MTB is moderate but does not impact survival.

AB  - Advances in chemotherapy and targeted therapies have improved survival in cancer patients with an increase of the incidence of newly diagnosed brain metastases (BMs). Intracranial metastases are symptomatic in 60-70% of patients. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with gadolinium is more sensitive than computed tomography and advanced neuroimaging techniques have been increasingly used in the detection, treatment planning, and follow-up of BM. Apart from the morphological analysis, the most effective tool for characterizing BM is immunohistochemistry. Molecular alterations not always reflect those of the primary tumor. More sophisticated methods of tumor analysis detecting circulating biomarkers in fluids (liquid biopsy), including circulating DNA, circulating tumor cells, and extracellular vesicles, containing tumor DNA and macromolecules (microRNA), have shown promise regarding tumor treatment response and progression. The choice of therapeutic approaches is guided by prognostic scores (Recursive Partitioning Analysis and diagnostic-specific Graded Prognostic Assessment-DS-GPA). The survival benefit of surgical resection seems limited to the subgroup of patients with controlled systemic disease and good performance status. Leptomeningeal disease (LMD) can be a complication, especially in posterior fossa metastases undergoing a "piecemeal" resection. Radiosurgery of the resection cavity may offer comparable survival and local control as postoperative whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT). WBRT alone is now the treatment of choice only for patients with single or multiple BMs not amenable to surgery or radiosurgery, or with poor prognostic factors. To reduce the neurocognitive sequelae of WBRT intensity modulated radiotherapy with hippocampal sparing, and pharmacological approaches (memantine and donepezil) have been investigated. In the last decade, a multitude of molecular abnormalities have been discovered. Approximately 33% of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumors and epidermal growth factor receptor mutations develop BMs, which are targetable with different generations of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs: gefitinib, erlotinib, afatinib, icotinib, and osimertinib). Other "druggable" alterations seen in up to 5% of NSCLC patients are the rearrangements of the "anaplastic lymphoma kinase" gene TKI (crizotinib, ceritinib, alectinib, brigatinib, and lorlatinib). In human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive, breast cancer targeted therapies have been widely used (trastuzumab, trastuzumab-emtansine, lapatinib-capecitabine, and neratinib). Novel targeted and immunotherapeutic agents have also revolutionized the systemic management of melanoma (ipilimumab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and BRAF inhibitors dabrafenib and vemurafenib).

TI  - Epigenetic Therapy for Thoracic Malignancies
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - Our published studies pertaining to more than 100 patients with lung and esophageal      cancers and pleural mesotheliomas, or pulmonary metastases from non-thoracic malignancies have      clearly demonstrated that Decitabine and romidepsin alone or in combination can modulate gene      expression in thoracic malignancies and induce immune responses against these neoplasms. Our      goal has always been to couple epigenetic priming regimens with adoptive immunotherapy for      thoracic malignancies. Presently, poor biodistribution and systemic toxicities prevent      optimal, chronic administration of epigenetic agents necessary to reprogram thoracic      malignancies. To overcome these limitations, we formulated DAC and tetrahydrouridine (a      potent, non-toxic inhibitor of CDA) for oral administration in collaboration with the      Cleveland Clinic. A phase I/II study of oral DAC/THU and pembrolizumab for patients with      inoperable NSCLC, esophageal cancers, or malignant pleural mesotheliomas is currently      underway. Virtually all patients have exhibited evidence of systemic epigenetic reprogramming,      and impressive, near complete and durable (1 yr) responses have been observed in several      patients. To further optimize epigenetic priming of pulmonary malignancies for immune      checkpoint blockade while decreasing potential systemic toxicities, we have recently initiated      preclinical studies to examine the pharmacokinetics and potential efficacy of azacytidine      administered by aerosolization techniques. A phase I/II clinical protocol trial to examine the      toxicities and potential efficacy of AZA administered via inhalation techniques in combination      with M7824, a dual immune checkpoint inhibitor-TGF-beta trap in patients with locally advanced      pulmonary metastases was approved by NIH IRB only to be closed due to a company decision not      to further develop M7824. This trial was intended to establish the paradigm for evaluation of      a series of aerosolized epigenetic agents alone or in combination with adoptive immunotherapy      for the treatment of locally advanced pulmonary malignancies. No similar efforts are currently      underway elsewhere in the world. The trial will be reinitiated once we have commitment from a      pharmaceutical company for a replacement immune checkpoint inhibitor. Additionally, we have      tentative commitment from AstraZeneca to conduct an inhaled AZA trial in combination with      Durvalumab in patients with operable early-stage NSCLC. This protocol is being prepared for      scientific review. Whereas cancer-testis antigens are expressed in a variety of human      malignancies, immune responses to these proteins are uncommon in thoracic oncology patients      due to low level, heterogeneous antigen expression, deficient antigen processing/presentation,      and local as well as systemic immunosuppression. Our published studies from cell lines and      patient biopsies have demonstrated that thoracic malignancies exhibit diverse patterns of CTA      expression and heterogeneous responses to epigenetic regimens that up-regulate CTAs. A      strategy to overcome these limitations is to immunize patients against a panel of CTAs that      potentially can be up-regulated by systemic administration of chromatin remodeling agents. To      address this issue, we conducted a phase 2.5 First-in-Human trial to ascertain if a tumor      lysate vaccine can induce broad immunity to CTA and determine if metronomic oral      cyclophosphamide and celecoxib (cy/cel) enhances vaccine-induced immune responses. The primary      endpoint was serologic response to purified CTA 1 month after the 6th vaccination. Exploratory      objectives included analysis of serologic reactivity to carbohydrate antigens and assessment      of peripheral immune subsets before and after vaccine therapy. All patients exhibited local      and systemic inflammatory responses lasting 72-96 hours following vaccinations. There were no      dose limiting treatment related toxicities in 21 patients accrued to the trial. 14 patients      (67%) completed all six vaccinations. 8 patients (57%) exhibited serologic responses to      NY-ESO-1. Additional reactivities were observed against GAGE7, XAGE, and MAGE-C2. Reactivities      against tumor-associated carbohydrate antigens were uncommon. Vaccine therapy decreased      percent Tregs (p=0.067*), PD-1 expression on Tregs (p=0.023*), and PD-L1 expression on CD14+      monocytes (p=0.0089*), classical monocytes (p=0.0159*), and intermediate monocytes (p=      0.0031*). Cy/cel did not impact immune responses or vaccine-induced alterations in peripheral      immune subsets. Laboratory metrics of response did not appear to correlate with patient      survival. Results of this positive trial have recently been published and support further      vaccination efforts in patients with thoracic malignancies. Two phase two trials one using the      lysate vaccine in combination with the IL-15 superagonist N-803 as post-operative adjuvant      therapy in lung cancer patients, and the other using the lysate in combination with entinostat      and nivolumab in esophageal cancer patients post chemo-radiation +/- surgery are undergoing      FDA and IRB approval at this time and are expected to be open for patient accrual in Autumn of      2022.

M3  - Review
AB  - Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) unfortunately carries a very poor prognosis. Patients usually do not become symptomatic, and therefore do not seek treatment, until the cancer is advanced and it is too late to employ curative treatment options. New therapeutic options are urgently needed for NSCLC, because even current targeted therapies cure very few patients. Active immunotherapy is an option that is gaining more attention. A delicate and complex interplay exists between the tumor and the immune system. Solid tumors utilize a variety of mechanisms to evade immune detection. However, if the immune system can be stimulated to recognize the tumor as foreign, tumor cells can be specifically eliminated with little systemic toxicity. A number of vaccines designed to boost immunity against NSCLC are currently undergoing investigation in phase III clinical trials. Belagenpumatucel-L, an allogeneic cell vaccine that decreases transforming growth factor (TGF-beta) in the tumor microenvironment, releases the immune suppression caused by the tumor and it has shown efficacy in a wide array of patients with advanced NSCLC. Melanoma-associated antigen A3 (MAGE-A3), an antigen-based vaccine, has shown promising results in MAGE-A3(+) NSCLC patients who have undergone complete surgical resection. L-BLP25 and TG4010 are both antigenic vaccines that target the Mucin-1 protein (MUC-1), a proto-oncogene that is commonly mutated in solid tumors. CIMAVax is a recombinant human epidermal growth factor (EGF) vaccine that induces anti-EGF antibody production and prevents EGF from binding to its receptor. These vaccines may significantly improve survival and quality of life for patients with an otherwise dismal NSCLC prognosis. This review is intended to give an overview of the current data and the most promising studies of active immunotherapy for NSCLC.

TI  - Immunotherapy or Chemoimmunotherapy in Older Adults With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
T2  - JAMA ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - IMPORTANCE Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) plus chemotherapy combination treatment (ICI-chemotherapy) is now a standard treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) without targetable oncogene alterations, but there are few data on ICI-chemotherapy for patients 75 years and older. OBJECTIVE To inform the choice of first-line drugs in clinical practice and assess the safety and efficacy of ICI-chemotherapy combination treatment in older adult patients with previously untreated advanced NSCLC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective cohort study included 58 centers in Japan. The cohort consisted of patients 75 years and older with clinical stage IIIB, IIIC, IV, postoperative or radiotherapy recurrent NSCLC. Patients started first-line systemic therapy between December 2018 and March 2021. Those receiving first-line molecular targeted drugs were excluded. The data were analyzed from February 2022 to October 2022. EXPOSURES Systemic therapy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The main outcomes were overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and safety. RESULTS A total of 1245 patients (median [range] age, 78 [75-95] years; 967 [78%] male) with NSCLC were included in the cohort. Programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression of less than 1% occurred in 268 tumors (22%); 1% to 49% in 387 tumors (31%); 50% and higher in 410 tumors (33%), and unknown expression in 180 tumors (14%). Median OS was 20.0 (95% CI, 17.1-23.6) months for the 354 patients receiving ICI-chemotherapy (28%); 19.8 (95% CI, 16.5-23.8) months for the 425 patients receiving ICI alone (34%); 12.8 (95% CI, 10.7-15.6) months for the 311 patients receiving platinum-doublet chemotherapy (25%); and 9.5 (95% CI, 7.4-13.4) months for the 155 patients receiving single-agent chemotherapy (12%). After propensity score matching, no differences in OS and PFS were found between the patients receiving ICI-chemotherapy vs ICI alone. Each group consisted of 118 patients. For PD-L1 expression of 1% and higher the OS hazard ratio (HR) was 0.98 (95% CI, 0.67-1.42; P = .90), and the PFS HR was 0.92 (95% CI, 0.67-1.25; P = .59). Significance was also not reached when separately analyzed for lower or higher PD-L1 expression (1%-49% or >= 50%). However, grade 3 or higher immune-related adverse events occurred in 86 patients (24.3%) treated with ICI-chemotherapy and 76 (17.9%) with ICI alone (P = .03). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study, ICI-chemotherapy combination treatment did not improve survival and increased the incidence of grade 3 and higher immune-related adverse events compared with ICI alone in patients 75 years and older. Based on these results, ICI alone may be recommended for older adult patients with PD-L1-positive NSCLC.

M3  - Journal Paper
AB  - Purpose/Objective(s) Standard therapy for unresectable locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC) is concurrent chemoradiotherapy (chemoRT), which is usually followed by adjuvant durvalumab. We performed a prospective trial testing sequential pembrolizumab and risk-adapted radiotherapy without chemotherapy for biomarker-selected LA-NSCLC patients.Materials/Methods Patients with AJCC version 8 stage III NSCLC or unresectable stage II NSCLC and ECOG performance status 0-1 were eligible for this trial. Subjects with PD-L1 tumor proportion score (TPS) ≥ 50% received three cycles of induction pembrolizumab (200 mg, every 21 days), underwent restaging FDG-PET/CT, received risk-adapted thoracic radiotherapy (55 Gy delivered to tumors or lymph nodes with metabolic tumor volume exceeding 20 cc and 48 Gy delivered to smaller lesions, all in 20 daily fractions), and then received up to 13 cycles of additional pembrolizumab. Subjects with PD-L1 TPS < 50% received concurrent chemoRT, and adjuvant durvalumab was recommended for patients without disease progression. The primary study endpoint was one-year progression-free survival (PFS) for subjects treated with pembrolizumab and radiotherapy (pembroRT), which we hypothesized would exceed 65%. Other study endpoints included 1-year overall survival (OS) and rates of clinician-scored (CTCAE v. 4.03) and patient-reported (PRO-CTCAE) adverse events observed over one year.Results Twenty-five subjects with PD-L1 TPS ≥ 50% and 12 subjects with PD-L1 TPS < 50% from three institutions were enrolled between August 2018 and November 2021. Median age was 70. Twenty-four subjects had stage II-IIIA disease, and 13 had stage IIIB-IIIC disease. Except for PD-L1 TPS, subject characteristics did not differ significantly across treatment groups. Ten out of the 12 subjects with ChemoRT received adjuvant durvalumab, and one received adjuvant osimertinib for EGFR mutation. The median follow-up duration is 15 months. Compared to patients treated with chemoRT, treatment with pembroRT has yielded numerically higher 1-year PFS (72% v. 46%, log rank p=0.232) and OS (91% v. 73%, log rank p=0.213) rates. Similar rates of grade 3 physician-scored adverse events have been observed with pembroRT (24%) and chemoRT (25%). Less severe patient-reported adverse events occurred with pembroRT compared to chemoRT (See Table).Conclusion Treatment with pembrolizumab and risk-adapted radiotherapy without chemotherapy is a promising approach for LA-NSCLC patients with PD-L1 TPS ≥ 50%. In addition to yielding high disease control rates, this strategy appears to reduce patient-reported adverse events compared to standard chemoRT and adjuvant therapy. All rights reserved Elsevier.

T2  - FUTURE SCIENCE OA
M3  - Article
AB  - Of the most prevalent solid tumors with advanced disease, prostate and ovarian cancer and non-small cell lung carcinoma have the fewest therapeutic options. Herein, we report the case of a 63-year-old male with metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma showing substantial remission post-administration of personalized dendritic cell-based vaccine APCEDEN (R) in combination with chemotherapeutic drug Mitoxantrone. Therapeutic response displayed an interesting clinical correlation validated by PET scan images showing decreased fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) avidity in the prostate gland, reduced skeletal metastases further established by the drop in serum Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) levels and expression of immune assessment markers (IFN-gamma, Tregs, neutrophil lymphocyte ratio and platelet lymphocyte ratio). This case demonstrates the potential efficacy of dendritic cell immunotherapy, showing a potent antitumor activity by enhancing the host immune responses, and improving quality of life.Lay abstract: Prostate adenocarcinoma is the most common cancer and second leading cause of cancer-related death inmen. Advanced cancers have very few therapeutic options. Understanding of the immune system has led to the development of novel personalized vaccines as an emerging and efficient treatment modality for cancer. This case study describes the substantial remission of advanced prostate cancer after receiving the personalized dendritic cell therapy APCEDEN in combination with the chemotherapy drug mitoxantrone, even after the patient's previous failed treatment history of standard hormonal, chemoand radiotherapy regimens. This case stands as an interesting example of combination therapy for cancer benefiting the patient.

TI  - Advances in Endostatin Therapy for Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
T2  - Chinese Journal of Clinical Oncology
M3  - Review
AB  - Angioge.nesis, growth, invasion and metastasis of cancer involve a multi-factorial process. Tumor growth and metastasis depend on tumor angiogenesis. Antiangiogenesis is a new strategy for cancer therapy. Endostatin is a recently discovered endogenous inhibitor of angiegenesis. In vivo and in vitro experiments have shown that Endostatin can specifically target endothelial cells, inhibiting proliferation and migration and inducing apoptosis. The antitumor mechanism of Endostatin and its signal transduction pathway are not yet thoroughly elucidated. Endostatin level is related to tumor condition and is considered a prognostic indicator. En- dostatin can enhance the antitumor effect of chemotherapy, radiotherapy and immunotherapy and decrease their adverse effects. In the past Several years, there have been many reports on Endostatin therapy for non-small cell lung cancer. We review the progress of the research on the structure of Endostatin and its mechanism, as well as its use in preclinical and clinical trials for treatment of non-small cell lung cancer.

TI  - A novel HLA-DQB2::MET gene fusion variant in lung adenocarcinoma with prolonged response to tepotinib: a case report
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL LUNG CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: MET rearrangements are infrequently observed in non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Advanced genomic detection techniques have unveiled such infrequent genomic variations, particularly MET fusions in approximately 0.5% of NSCLC patients. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have revolutionized the standard of care in lung cancer and more recently a second generation MET TKI tepotinib received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for MET exon 14 alterations in metastatic NSCLC. Despite this, the therapeutic landscape for MET -rearranged NSCLC patients remains significantly unexplored. The aim of our report is to detail a unique case of a patient with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma with a novel HLADQB2::MET fusion detected by next -generation sequencing (NGS) following previous treatment resistance. Case Description: A 73 -year -old female was initially started on carboplatin, pemetrexed and pembrolizumab with maintenance, but eventually had progression in the left upper lobe (LUL). Upon progression she was enrolled in a clinical trial of a monoclonal antibody with or without a PD -1 inhibitor, but brain metastasis progression was eventually detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) requiring stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and a craniotomy. The trial drug was eventually discontinued due to progression and toxicity and NGS on bronchoscopy tissue revealed HLA-DQB2::MET fusion. The patient was initiated on tepotinib and continues with clinical and radiological stable disease for over 12 months. The patient's response to a MET inhibitor, tepotinib, underscores the potential efficacy of selective MET inhibitors for individuals with previously unexplored MET fusions. Conclusions: The positive response to tepotinib of a patient with NSCLC harboring a novel METFusion underscores the importance of the use of comprehensive next -generational sequencing -based panels and highlights the necessity for additional research and clinical exploration of selective MET inhibitors for managing NSCLC with MET rearrangements.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Purpose: Dyspnea is an important symptomatic endpoint for assessment of radiation-induced lung injury (RILI) following radical radiotherapy in locally advanced disease, which remains the mainstay of treatment at the time of significant advances in therapy including combination treatments with immunotherapy and chemotherapy and the use of local ablative radiotherapy techniques. We investigated the relationship between dose-volume parameters and subjective changes in dyspnea as a measure of RILI and the relationship to spirometry.Material and Methods: Eighty patients receiving radical radiotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer were prospectively assessed for dyspnea using two patient-completed tools: EORTC QLQ-LC13 dyspnea quality of life assessment and dyspnea visual analogue scale (VAS). Global quality of life, spirometry and radiation pneumonitis grade were also assessed. Comparisons were made with lung dose-volume parameters.Results: The median survival of the cohort was 26 months. In the evaluable group of 59 patients there were positive correlations between lung dose-volume parameters and a change in dyspnea quality of life scale at 3 months (V-30 p=0.017; V-40 p=0.026; V-50 p=0.049; mean lung dose p=0.05), and a change in dyspnea VAS at 6 months (V-30 p=0.05; V-40 p=0.026; V-50 p=0.028) after radiotherapy. Lung dose-volume parameters predicted a 10% increase in dyspnea quality of life score at 3 months (V-40; p=0.041, V-50; p=0.037) and dyspnea VAS score at 6 months (V-40; p=0.027) post-treatment.Conclusions: Worsening of dyspnea is an important symptom of RILI. We demonstrate a relationship between lung dose-volume parameters and a 10% worsening of subjective dyspnea scores. Our findings support the use of subjective dyspnea tools in future studies on radiation-induced lung toxicity, particularly at doses below conventional lung radiation tolerance limits.

AB  - Recently immune-checkpoint inhibitors have demonstrated promising clinical efficacy in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the response rates to immune checkpoint blockade drugs remain modest (45% in the front line setting and 20% in the second line setting). Consequently, there is an unmet need to develop accurate, validated biomarkers to predict which NSCLC patients will benefit from immunotherapy. While there has been recent interest in evaluating the role of texture and shape patterns of the nodule on CT scans to predict response to checkpoint inhibitors for NSCLC, our group has shown that nodule vessel morphology might also play a role in determining tumor aggressiveness and behavior. In this work we present a new approach using quantitative vessel tortuosity (QVT) radiomics, to predict response to checkpoint inhibitors and overall survival for patients with NSCLC treated with Nivolumab (a PD1 inhibitor) on a retrospective data set of 111 patients (D-1) including 56 responders and 45 non-responders. Patients who did not receive Nivolumab after 2 cycles due to a lack of response or progression as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) were classified as non-responders, patients who had radiological response or stable disease as per RECIST were classified as responders. On D-1, in conjunction with a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier the QVT features were able to predict response to immunotherapy with an AUC of 0.73 +/- 0.04. Kaplan Meier analysis showed significant difference of overall survival between patients with low risk and high risk defined by the radiomics classifier (p-value = 0.004, HR= 2.29, 95% CI= 1.35 - 3.87).

TI  - A phase II study of S-1 and cisplatin with concurrent thoracic radiotherapy followed by durvalumab for unresectable, locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer in Japan (SAMURAI study)
T2  - THERAPEUTIC ADVANCES IN MEDICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Based on the results of the PACIFIC study, chemoradiotherapy followed by 1-year consolidation therapy with durvalumab was established as the standard of care for unresectable, locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC). However, some topics not foreseen in that design can be explored, including progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) after the start of chemoradiotherapy, the proportion of patients who proceeded to consolidation therapy with durvalumab, and the optimal chemotherapeutic regimens. In Japan, the combination regimen of S-1 + cisplatin (SP), for which the results of multiple clinical studies have suggested a good balance of efficacy and tolerability, is frequently selected in clinical settings. However, the efficacy and safety of consolidation therapy with durvalumab following this SP regimen have not been evaluated. We therefore planned a multicenter, prospective, single-arm, phase II study.Methods: In treatment-naive LA-NSCLC, two cycles of combination chemotherapy with S-1 (80-120 mg/body, Days 1-14) + cisplatin (60 mg/m(2), Day 1) will be administered at an interval of 4 weeks, with concurrent thoracic radiotherapy (60 Gy). Responders will then receive durvalumab every 2 weeks for up to 1 year. The primary endpoint is 1-year PFS rate.Discussion: Compared with the conventional standard regimen in Japan, the SP regimen is expected to be associated with lower incidences of pneumonitis, esophagitis, and febrile neutropenia, which complicate the initiation of consolidation therapy with durvalumab, and have higher antitumor efficacy during chemoradiotherapy. Therefore, SP-based chemoradiotherapy is expected to be successfully followed by consolidation therapy with durvalumab in more patients, resulting in prolonged PFS and OS. Toxicity and efficacy results of the SP regimen in this study will also provide information important to the future establishment of the concurrent combination of chemoradiotherapy and durvalumab.Trial registration: Japan Registry of Clinical Trials, jRCTs031190127, registered 1 November 2019, https://jrct.niph.go.jp/latest-detail/jRCTs031190127

TI  - Outcomes from salvage chemotherapy or pembrolizumab beyond progression with or without local ablative therapies for advanced non-small cell lung cancers with PD-L1 ≥50% who progress on first-line immunotherapy: real-world data from a European cohort
T2  - JOURNAL OF THORACIC DISEASE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: In this real-world multicenter study we addressed the activity of post-progression anticancer treatments after first-line pembrolizumab in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with PD-L1 >= 50%.Methods: Clinico-pathological data of PD-L1 >= 50% advanced NSCLCs who failed first-line pembrolizumab were collected in 14 Oncologic Centers from different European countries. Types of subsequent anticancer treatment and outcomes on salvage chemotherapy or pembrolizumab beyond progression with or without the addition of local ablative therapies were reported.Results: Out of 173 patients, 100 had progressed on pembrolizumab, of which 60 patients (60%) met eligibility criteria and were treated with either salvage chemotherapy (42/60, 70%) or pembrolizumab beyond progression (18/60, 30%). Overall, median age was 66 years, 63.3% were male, 60.0% had a performance status of 0-1, 88.3% were smokers and 61.7% had adenocarcinoma histology. In patients evaluable for response, objective response rate to salvage chemotherapy was 41.9%, with no significant difference according to the type of regimen (42.9% for platinum-based and 40.0% for single-agent chemotherapy). Median progression-free survival (PFS) to salvage chemotherapy was 4.5 months. Among patients treated with pembrolizumab beyond progression, 13 out of 18 patients (72.2%) had progressive disease in <= 2 organ sites, of whom 9 (69.2%) were managed with the addition of local ablative therapies consisting of radiation at progressive lesion(s). No significant difference was noted in terms of post-progression survival between the salvage chemotherapy and the pembrolizumab beyond progression groups of patients (6.9 versus 8.1 months, respectively, P=0.08).Conclusions: In PD-L1 >= 50% advanced NSCLCs who progress on first-line pembrolizumab, salvage chemotherapy is associated with a remarkable anticancer activity, while select patients may benefit from continuation of pembrolizumab beyond progression, with the possible addition of local ablative radiotherapy in oligoprogressive cases.

TI  - Mechanisms of Arginine Deprivation in Small Cell Lung Cancer
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - Project SummarySmall cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly aggressive neuroendocrine lung tumor responsible for over 30,000deaths each year in the US. SCLC has a two-year survival rate of ~6% with no approved targeted therapiesbeyond the recent approval of immunotherapy. SCLC is initially highly responsive to chemotherapy, but rapidlydevelops resistance leading to mortality in ~12 months. A major unmet need for SCLC treatment is theidentification of new therapeutic targets and treatment strategies. SCLC has historically been treated as a singledisease without patient stratification. SCLC is driven by distinct MYC family members (MYCL or MYC), whichare notoriously difficult to drug. We and others showed that MYC and MYCL-driven SCLC have distinct molecularphenotypes with unique vulnerabilities to targeted therapies. We performed unbiased metabolite profiling onMYC versus MYCL-driven subtypes of SCLC and found that they are metabolically distinct. Using human celllines, genetically-engineered mouse models (GEMMs), and human patient-derived xenografts (PDX), we foundthat MYC-driven SCLC is uniquely dependent on the amino acid arginine. Arginine depletion with pegylatedarginine deiminase (ADI-PEG20) is the most effective drug we have tested in >25 drug combinations in GEMMs.Consistently, MYC-driven SCLC has reduced ASS1 expression, the enzyme required to synthesize arginine. Inpreliminary data, we discovered that MYC-driven tumor cells treated with ADI-PEG20 undergo autophagy andferroptosis. After dramatic initial responses, tumors eventually relapse with re-expression of ASS1 and metabolicreprogramming with changes in one-carbon, polyamine, and ferroptosis-related pathways. We hypothesize thatarginine deprivation in MYC-driven SCLC promotes autophagy and death by ferroptosis, and that inhibition offerroptosis will improve the efficacy of ADI-PEG20. We also hypothesize that during ADI-PEG20 resistance, re-expression of ASS1 leads to metabolic reprogramming that can be blocked by targeting new metabolic pathways.To test these hypotheses, our objectives are: 1) Determine the function of autophagy and ferroptosis in responseto arginine deprivation in SCLC. 2) Determine mechanisms of resistance to ADI-PEG20 and test newcombination strategies to increase the efficacy of ADI-PEG20 treatment. This approach is innovative becausewe will employ our immune-competent GEMM of MYC-driven SCLC and new human PDX that recapitulate keyfeatures of the human disease. We will integrate state-of-the-art technologies in metabolite profiling and singlecell RNA-seq to understand the mechanisms of resistance to arginine deprivation in vivo. This research issignificant because arginine deprivation is being tested in numerous clinical trials in various cancer types andwe are currently designing new clinical trials for ADI-PEG20 in SCLC. A better understanding of the functions ofarginine deprivation may improve treatment of MYC-driven cancers and lead to more effective combinationtreatment strategies.

TI  - Redetermination of PD-L1 expression after chemio-radiation in locally advanced PDL1 negative NSCLC patients: retrospective multicentric analysis
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Chemoradiation therapy (CRT) is the treatment of choice for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC). Several clinical trials that combine programmed cell death 1 (PD1) axis inhibitors with radiotherapy are in development for patients with LA-NSCLC. However, the effect of CRT on tumor cells programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression is unknown.Methods In this multicentric retrospective study, we analyzed paired NSCLC specimens that had been obtained pre- and post-CRT. PD-L1 expression on tumor cells was studied by immunohistochemistry. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility, risk of complications, and clinical relevance of performing re-biopsy after CRT in patients with PD-L1 negative LA-NSCLC.Results Overall, 31 patients from 6 centers with PD-L1 negative LA-NSCLC were analyzed. The percentage of tumor cells with PD-L1 expression significantly increased between pre- and post-CRT specimens in 14 patients (45%). Nine patients had unchanged PD-L1 expression after CRT, in five patients the rebiopsy material was insufficient for PD-L1 analysis and in two patients no tumor cells at rebiopsy were found. The post-rebiopsy complication rate was very low (6%). All patients with positive PD-L1 re-biopsy received Durvalumab maintenance after CRT, except one patient who had a long hospitalization for tuberculosis reactivation. Median PFS of patients with unchanged or increased PD-L1 expression was 10 and 16.9 months, respectively.Conclusion CRT administration can induce PD-L1 expression in a considerable fraction of PD-L1 negative patients at baseline, allowing them receiving the maintenance Durvalumab in Europe. Hence, after a definitive CRT, PD-L1 redetermination should be considered in patients with LA-NSCLC PD-L1 negative, to have a better selection of maintenance Durvalumab candidates.

TI  - Survival outcomes and prognostic nutritional index in very elderly small-cell lung cancer patients: importance of active treatment and nutritional support
T2  - AGING MALE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly aggressive tumor with a high metastatic potential, particularly affecting current or former heavy smokers. Treatment typically involves chemotherapy, often combined with radiotherapy, and immunotherapy for extensive disease. Prophylactic cranial irradiation is recommended to reduce brain metastases. Elderly SCLC patients face unique challenges due to frailty and comorbidities, leading to increased risks of treatment-related toxicity and malnutrition. The prognostic nutritional index (PNI), a composite marker of nutritional and immune status, has shown promise in predicting outcomes in various malignancies. However, the optimal treatment approach for very elderly SCLC patients remains unclear, as they are often excluded from clinical trials.Aims: This study aimed to evaluate the survival outcomes of SCLC patients aged 75 years or older and their correlation with PNI.Study design Retrospective cohort study.Methods: The study retrospectively analyzed data from 71 SCLC patients aged =75 years, focusing on age, gender, smoking status, chronic diseases, performance status, clinical stage, treatment modality, and pretreatment PNI. Survival estimates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of overall survival (OS).Results: The results demonstrated that 26.8% of very elderly SCLC patients received no active treatment, resulting in a significantly shorter median survival time of 1.3 months. In contrast, patients who underwent aggressive treatment, such as palliative chemotherapy or chemotherapy plus radiotherapy, had significantly longer median survival times. Multivariate analysis revealed that receiving chemotherapy plus radiotherapy was associated with a significant survival benefit compared to no treatment. Furthermore, low PNI (=40) was independently associated with decreased OS.Conclusion: This study highlights the importance of active treatment and nutritional support in improving survival outcomes for very elderly SCLC patients. The findings suggest that low PNI and lack of oncological treatment are associated with worse survival outcomes. Therefore, integrating nutritional assessment, interventions, and appropriate treatment strategies are crucial in managing lung cancer patients. Larger, multicenter studies are needed to validate these findings and explore potential interventions to optimize nutritional status and improve outcomes for elderly patients with SCLC.

AB  - Project SummarySmall cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly aggressive neuroendocrine lung tumor responsible for over 30,000deaths each year in the US. SCLC has a two-year survival rate of ~6% with no approved targeted therapiesbeyond the recent approval of immunotherapy. SCLC is initially highly responsive to chemotherapy, but rapidlydevelops resistance leading to mortality in ~12 months. A major unmet need for SCLC treatment is theidentification of new therapeutic targets and treatment strategies. SCLC has historically been treated as a singledisease without patient stratification. SCLC is driven by distinct MYC family members (MYCL or MYC), whichare notoriously difficult to drug. We and others showed that MYC and MYCL-driven SCLC have distinct molecularphenotypes with unique vulnerabilities to targeted therapies. We performed unbiased metabolite profiling onMYC versus MYCL-driven subtypes of SCLC and found that they are metabolically distinct. Using human celllines, genetically-engineered mouse models (GEMMs), and human patient-derived xenografts (PDX), we foundthat MYC-driven SCLC is uniquely dependent on the amino acid arginine. Arginine depletion with pegylatedarginine deiminase (ADI-PEG20) is the most effective drug we have tested in >25 drug combinations in GEMMs.Consistently, MYC-driven SCLC has reduced ASS1 expression, the enzyme required to synthesize arginine. Inpreliminary data, we discovered that MYC-driven tumor cells treated with ADI-PEG20 undergo autophagy andferroptosis. After dramatic initial responses, tumors eventually relapse with re-expression of ASS1 and metabolicreprogramming with changes in one-carbon, polyamine, and ferroptosis-related pathways. We hypothesize thatarginine deprivation in MYC-driven SCLC promotes autophagy and death by ferroptosis, and that inhibition offerroptosis will improve the efficacy of ADI-PEG20. We also hypothesize that during ADI-PEG20 resistance, re-expression of ASS1 leads to metabolic reprogramming that can be blocked by targeting new metabolic pathways.To test these hypotheses, our objectives are: 1) Determine the function of autophagy and ferroptosis in responseto arginine deprivation in SCLC. 2) Determine mechanisms of resistance to ADI-PEG20 and test newcombination strategies to increase the efficacy of ADI-PEG20 treatment. This approach is innovative becausewe will employ our immune-competent GEMM of MYC-driven SCLC and new human PDX that recapitulate keyfeatures of the human disease. We will integrate state-of-the-art technologies in metabolite profiling and singlecell RNA-seq to understand the mechanisms of resistance to arginine deprivation in vivo. This research issignificant because arginine deprivation is being tested in numerous clinical trials in various cancer types andwe are currently designing new clinical trials for ADI-PEG20 in SCLC. A better understanding of the functions ofarginine deprivation may improve treatment of MYC-driven cancers and lead to more effective combinationtreatment strategies.

TI  - Strategies to overcome resistance to ALK inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer: a narrative review
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL LUNG CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Background and Objective: Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangements are detected in 3-7% of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). There are currently 5 U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for the treatment of patients with ALK-positive lung cancer in the advanced/metastatic disease setting. Despite these advances, most patients with ALK-positive lung cancer who are treated with ALK TKI therapy ultimately experience disease progression due to various mechanisms of drug resistance. In this review, we discuss strategies to address acquired therapeutic resistance to ALK inhibition, novel agents and combinatorial strategies in development for both on and off-target resistance, and some emerging approaches to prolong response to ALK inhibitors.Methods: We performed a search of peer-reviewed literature in the English language, conference abstracts, and trial registrations from the MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Elsevier), and CENTRAL (Cochrane Library) databases and major international oncology meetings up to August 2022. We then screened for studies describing interventions to overcome ALK resistance based on review of each title and abstract. Key Content and Findings: For patients with oligo-progression, treatment may include maintaining the same systemic treatment beyond progression while adding local therapies to progressing lesions. Strategies to combat ALK TKI resistance mediated by on-target resistance mechanisms include 4th generation TKIs (TPX-0131, NVL-655) and Proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) currently in development. While for those patients who develop tumor progression due to off-target (ALK independent) resistance, options may include combination therapies targeting ALK and other downstream or parallel pathways, novel antibody drug conjugates, or combinations of ALK inhibitors with chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Lastly, other potential strategies being explored in the clinic include circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) surveillance to monitor for molecular mediators of drug resistance prior to frank progression on imaging studies and utilization of ALK TKIs in the adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings.Conclusions: Strategies to overcome resistance to currently available ALK inhibitors are urgently needed. Given the variety of resistance mechanisms, tailormade approaches are required for disease control.

TI  - Prospective analysis of factors precluding the initiation of durvalumab from an interim analysis of a phase II trial of S-1 and cisplatin with concurrent thoracic radiotherapy followed by durvalumab for unresectable, locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer in Japan (SAMURAI study)
T2  - THERAPEUTIC ADVANCES IN MEDICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The standard of care for unresectable, locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC) is chemoradiotherapy (CRT) followed by durvalumab, based on the PACIFIC trial. Disease progression and pneumonitis were reported as the main reasons to preclude the initiation of durvalumab in multiple retrospective studies. However, the transition rate and the reasons for failure to proceed to consolidation therapy with durvalumab after CRT were not evaluated prospectively. Although phase II studies in Japan have shown high efficacy and tolerability of CRT with cisplatin + S-1 (SP), no prospective study using durvalumab after SP-based CRT has yet been reported. We therefore conducted a phase II study to verify the efficacy and safety of durvalumab following SP-based CRT. In this interim analysis, we report the transition rate and the reasons for its failure.Methods: In treatment-naive LA-NSCLC, cisplatin (60 mg/m(2), day 1) and S-1 (80-120 mg/body, days 1-14) were administered with two 4-week cycles with concurrent thoracic radiotherapy (60 Gy) followed by durvalumab every 2 weeks for up to 12 months. The primary endpoint was 12 month progression-free survival rate.Results: Fifty-nine patients were enrolled, of whom 86.4% (51/59) proceeded to durvalumab. All of them initiated durvalumab within 42 days after CRT [median 18 days (range: 3-38)], including 27.5% (14/51) in <14 days. Common reasons for failure to proceed to durvalumab were disease progression (2/59, 3.4%) and adverse events (6/59, 10.2%). Among the latter cases, four resumed treatment and proceeded to durvalumab within 42 days on off-protocol. The objective response rate and the disease control rate were 62.7% and 93.2%, respectively. The incidences of >= grade 3 pneumonitis, febrile neutropenia, and esophagitis were 0%, 8.5%, and 3.4%, respectively.Conclusion: Regarding durvalumab after CRT, this interim analysis of the SAMURAI study clarified the high transition rate, early introduction, and reasons for failure to proceed to consolidation therapy, which were not determined in the PACIFIC trial.

TI  - Neoadjuvant pembrolizumab and chemotherapy in resectable clinical stage III non-small-cell lung cancer: a retrospective cohort study
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL LUNG CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Pembrolizumab has been shown to be effective and safe in improving the survival of patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the effectiveness and safty of pembrolizumab in the induction treatment of patients with potential resectable clinical stage III NSCLC remains undetermined.Methods: A total of 25 patients who received neoadjuvant pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy for preoperative stage III NSCLC between August 2020 and November 2021 in Zhongshan Hospital were retrospectively evaluated, and 21 of them were followed by pulmonary resection. The neoadjuvant treatment was as follows: intravenous pembrolizumab (200 mg) on day 1, carboplatin [target area under the curve (AUC) 5 mg/mL] or cisplatin (75 mg/m(2)) on day 1, and pemetrexed ( 500 mg/m(2) for adenocarcinoma) or nabpaclitaxel (260 mg/m(2) for other subtypes) on day 1 of every 21-day cycle up to two or three cycles.Results: The mean age of all 25 patients was 65 years, of whom 22 were men and 3 were women. Seventeen were diagnosed before treatment as clinical stage IIIA, seven as IIIB, and one as IIB. All received neoadjuvant immunotherapy plus chemotherapy. Following induction therapy, 21 patients with stable disease or partial response (PR) according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) underwent surgical resection without delay. Among the patients who underwent operation, major pathological response (MPR) was achieved in 13 patients, including 6 (28.6%) patients achieved a complete pathological response (CPR). Two patients with partial radiologic remission refused operative treatment, one had progressive disease (PD), and another developed a grade immune pneumonia and could not tolerate surgery. However, none of the adverse events caused surgery delays or deaths.Conclusions: Neoadjuvant pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy could be considered reliable for clinical stage III NSCLC, but needs to be validated with more robust clinical trials.

TI  - Phase 2 Trial Assessing Toxicity of Personalized Response-Based Radiation Treatment in Patients With Locally Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.
T2  - International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - PURPOSE: Local failure rates after treatment for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remain high. Efforts to improve local control with a uniform dose escalation or dose escalation to midtreatment positron emission tomography (PET)-avid residual disease have been limited by heightened toxicity. This trial aimed to refine response-based adaptive radiation therapy (RT) and minimize toxicity by incorporating fluorodeoxyglucose-PET (FDG-PET) and ventilation-perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging midtreatment.METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 47 patients with stage IIA to III unresectable NSCLC were prospectively enrolled in this single-institution trial (NCT02492867). Patients received concurrent chemoradiation therapy with personalized response-based adaptive RT over 30 fractions incorporating ventilation-perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography and FDG-PET. The first 21 fractions (46.2 Gy at 2.2 Gy/fraction) were delivered to the tumor while minimizing the dose to the SPECT-defined functional lung. The plan was then adapted for the final 9 fractions (2.2-3.8 Gy/fraction) up to a total of 80.4 Gy, based on the midtreatment FDG-PET tumor response to escalate the dose to the residual tumor while minimizing the dose to the SPECT-defined functional lung. Nonprogressing patients received consolidative carboplatin, paclitaxel, or durvalumab. The primary endpoint of the study was ≥ grade 2 lung and esophageal toxicities. Secondary endpoints included time to local progression, tumor response, and overall survival.RESULTS: At 1 year posttreatment, the rates of grade 2 and grade 3 pneumonitis were 21.3% and 2.1%, respectively, with no difference in pneumonitis rates among patients who received and did not receive adjuvant durvalumab (P = .74). Although there were no grade 3 esophageal-related toxicities, 66.0% of patients experienced grade 2 esophagitis. The 1- and 2-year local control rates were 94.5% (95% CI, 87.4%-100%) and 87.5% (95% CI, 76.7%-100%), respectively. Overall survival was 82.8% (95% CI, 72.6%-94.4%) at 1 year and 62.3% (95% CI, 49.6%-78.3%) at 2 years.CONCLUSIONS: Response-based adaptive dose-escalation accounting for tumor change and normal tissue function during treatment provided excellent local control, comparable toxicity to standard chemoradiation therapy, and did not increase toxicity with adjuvant immunotherapy.

TI  - Prognostic and predictive value of PD-L1 expression and tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TiLs) in locally advanced NSCLC treated with simultaneous radiochemotherapy in the randomized, multicenter, phase III German Intergroup lung Trial (GILT)
T2  - LUNG CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Immune checkpoint inhibition after radiochemotherapy (RTCT) has become a new standard of care for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer with programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression. However, little is known about the prognostic role of immune response markers in this setting. We analysed PD-L1 expression and tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TiLs) in tumour biopsies from the multicenter German Intergroup Lung Trial (GILT), which previously randomised patients with stage III NSCLC to RTCT with or without consolidation chemotherapy. Materials and methods: We retrospectively analyzed tumour biopsies from patients treated in the GILT trial. PD-L1 expression was analysed using the Ventana SP263 assay and TiL score (low, intermediate, high) and pattern (excluded, inflamed, desert) were assessed. The primary endpoint of the biomarker analysis was PFS in patients with PD-L1 > 1% vs. PD-L1 < 1% NSCLC. Secondary endpoints explored the prognostic relevance of additional PD-L1 expression levels and TiL score and pattern. Results: Biopsies were available from 92 patients treated with RTCT. Patients with available tumor tissue did not differ significantly from the whole study population. PD-L1 scores from 78 samples were available for analysis. There was no difference in PFS in the PD-L1 < 1% vs. PD-L1 > 1% subgroups. TiL score was available in 66 patients. Patients with high TiL score showed favourable overall survival compared to the low TiL subgroup. This trend was most pronounced in those patients treated with consolidative chemotherapy. Conclusion: In this analysis, PD-L1 expression did not correlate with PFS following RTCT. However, patients with TiLs > 10% were found to have longer overall survival, especially for those patients treated with consolidation chemotherapy after the end of RTCT. Further analyses to explore the prognostic and predictive relevance of TiLs in the context of consolidative checkpoint inhibition with durvalumab are required.

TI  - A nomogram model for predicting the risk of checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonitis for patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer
T2  - CANCER MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Immunotherapy extensively treats advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Although immunotherapy is generally better tolerated than chemotherapy, it can cause multiple immune-related adverse events (irAEs) involving multiple organs. Checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonitis (CIP) is a relatively uncommon irAE that, in severe cases, can be fatal. Potential risk factors for the occurrence of CIP are currently poorly understood. This study sought to develop a novel scoring system for predicting the risk of CIP based on a nomogram model.Methods: We retrospectively collected advanced NSCLC patients who received immunotherapy at our institution between January 1, 2018, and December 30, 2021. All patients who met the criteria were randomly divided into the training set and testing set (in a ratio of 7:3), and cases fulfilling the CIP diagnostic criteria were screened. The patients' baseline clinical characteristics, laboratory tests, imaging, and treatment information were extracted from the electronic medical records. The risk factors associated with the occurrence of CIP were identified based on the results of logistic regression analysis on the training set, and a nomogram prediction model was developed. The discrimination and prediction accuracy of the model was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, the concordance index (C-index), and the calibration curve. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was used to evaluate the clinical applicability of the model.Results: The training set comprised 526 (CIP: 42 cases), and the testing set comprised 226 (CIP: 18 cases) patients, respectively. In the training set, the final multivariate regression analysis revealed that age (p = 0.014; odds ratio [OR] = 1.056; 95% Confidence Interval [CI] =1.011-1.102), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (p = 0.002; OR = 6.170; 95% CI = 1.943-19.590), history of prior radiotherapy (p < 0.001; OR = 4.005; 95% CI = 1.920-8.355), baseline white blood cell count (WBC) (p < 0.001; OR = 1.604; 95% CI = 1.250-2.059), and baseline absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) (p = 0.034; OR = 0.288; 95% CI = 0.091-0.909) were identified as independent risk factors for the occurrence of CIP. A prediction nomogram model was developed based on these five parameters. The area under the ROC curve and C-index of the prediction model in the training set and testing set were 0.787 (95% CI: 0.716-0.857) and 0.874 (95% CI: 0.792-0.957), respectively. The calibration curves are in good agreement. The DCA curves indicate that the model has good clinical utility.Conclusion: We developed a nomogram model that proved to be a good assistant tool for predicting the risk of CIP in advanced NSCLC. This model has the potential power to help clinicians in making treatment decisions.

TI  - Determinants of successful minimally invasive surgery for resectable non-small cell lung cancer after neoadjuvant therapy.
T2  - The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) (video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery and robot-assisted thoracoscopic surgery) for pulmonary resection is standard in early-stage non-small cell lung cancer because it is associated with better perioperative outcomes than thoracotomy. MIS for resection of more advanced non-small cell lung cancer (Stages IB-IIIB) treated with neoadjuvant therapy has been utilized. However, the determinants of success are not well defined.METHODS: A single institution retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database was conducted, querying for patients with clinical Stage IB through IIIB non-small cell lung cancer who had resection after neoadjuvant systemic therapy without radiation from 2013 to 2022. Patients were grouped by surgical approach; that is, open versus MIS. Successful MIS was defined by no conversion, R0 resection, and no major (grade 3 or greater) morbidity. Analyses by intent-to-treat assessed outcomes by Wilcoxon rank-sum test and Fisher exact test. (Multivariable regression analysis identified variables that contributed to successful MIS resection.) RESULTS: Of 627 eligible patients, 360 (57%) had open and 267 (43%) had MIS procedures. Most patients (79.1%) received neoadjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy, and 21.9% were treated with immunotherapy or targeted therapy alone or combined with chemotherapy. Among MIS resections, 179 (67%) were performed by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery and 88 (33%) by robot-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. The conversion rate was 16% (n=43). Successful MIS resection was achieved in 77% of patients. Multivariable regression analysis showed that pretreatment clinical N stage was a significant determinant of success, but not pretreatment clinical T stage or type of neoadjuvant therapy.CONCLUSIONS: Following neoadjuvant systemic therapy for clinical stage IB or IIIB non-small cell lung cancer, MIS resection can be successfully accomplished and should be considered in appropriate patients. Presence of pretreatment nodal disease is associated with higher odds of conversion, major morbidity, and incomplete resection.

TI  - Concerning Safety and Efficacy of Concurrent and Consolidative Durvalumab With Thoracic Radiation Therapy in PDL1-Unselected Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: Brief Report.
T2  - International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - PURPOSE: Consolidative durvalumab, an anti-programmed death ligand 1 (PDL1) immune checkpoint inhibitor, administered after concurrent chemoradiation improves outcomes of patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) without substantially increasing toxicities. We studied a chemotherapy-free regimen of thoracic radiation therapy (RT) with concurrent and consolidative durvalumab.METHODS AND MATERIALS: This single-arm phase 2 trial enrolled patients with stage III NSCLC (regardless of tumor PDL1 expression), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1, adequate pulmonary function, and RT fields meeting standard organ constraints. Participants received 2 cycles of durvalumab (1500 mg every 4 weeks) concurrently with thoracic RT (60 Gy in 30 fractions), followed by up to 13 cycles of consolidative durvalumab.RESULTS: After 10 patients were enrolled, the trial was closed because of poor clinical outcomes. With a median follow-up of 12 months, 5 patients had disease progression and 8 patients died. Six patients experienced 15 treatment-related, grade ≥3 events, including 1 grade 4 acute kidney injury during consolidation and 2 fatal pulmonary events. One fatal pulmonary event occurred during the concurrent phase in an active smoker; the other occurred after the first cycle of consolidative durvalumab. The primary endpoint of progression-free survival at 12 months was 20% (50% for PDL1≥1% vs 0% for PDL1 unavailable or <1%). Median overall survival was not reached, 10.5 months, and 7 months, for PDL1 ≥1%, <1%, and unavailable, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: In PDL1 unselected stage III NSCLC, thoracic RT plus concurrent and consolidative durvalumab is associated with high-grade toxicity and early disease progression.

TI  - Lung cancer with brain metastases remaining in continuous complete remission due to pembrolizumab and temozolomide: a case report
T2  - ANNALS OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Immunotherapy has been shown to improve the overall survival (OS) in patients with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC) without driver gene mutations. However, monotherapy with immunotherapy alone or combined with chemotherapy in NSCLC patients with untreated brain metastases (BM) is still under debate. Data regarding treatment of BM with immunotherapy and temozolomide (TMZ) in patients with NSCLC is rare.Case Presentation: A 60-year-old male due to cough and expectoration presented in our hospital. Chest computed tomography (CT), brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and immunohistochemistry of a mediastinal lymph node biopsy were administered, he was diagnosed with stage IIIB lung adenocarcinoma. Without driver gene mutations, he was treated with platinum-based chemotherapy because he refused to accept concurrent radiation therapy (RT). Heavy cough companied with hemoptysis and chest CT scan both revealed progressive disease (PD) after 6 cycles of chemotherapy. Immunotherapy was consequently considered, while two metastatic lesions in the brain were confirmed after combined treatment of pembrolizumab with docetaxel. TMZ was administered in combination with pembrolizumab (200 mg, day 1). A new metastasis in the right occipital lobe was detected on a scan 1 month later, though the other 2 lesions continued to shrink. The treatment was continued, MRI and CT scans suggested complete response (CR) was achieved for both the BM and lung lesions after 3 cycles. Consolidation therapy with TMZ and pembrolizumab ( 100 mg) per month was considered for another 7 months. Maintenance monotherapy with pembrolizumab (100 mg) was selected because of his stable CR status. At 59 months since diagnosis, the patient remains alive, with CR for both the primary lesions and BM. The patient experienced slight numbness on each side of his feet. There was no occurrence of adverse effects greater than grade 3.Conclusions: The data indicates that immunotherapy combined with TMZ for untreated BM in NSCLC patients maybe an efficient and safe decision making therapeutic choice. Despite the encouraging efficacy of the combination, it is an isolated case and the speculation of synergism need to be proved in further pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies even in large randomized controlled trials.

TI  - CARdioimaging in Lung Cancer PatiEnts Undergoing Radical RadioTherapy: CARE-RT Trial
T2  - DIAGNOSTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a common, steady growing lung tumour that is often discovered when a surgical approach is forbidden. For locally advanced inoperable NSCLC, the clinical approach consists of a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, eventually followed by adjuvant immunotherapy, a treatment that is useful but may cause several mild and severe adverse effect. Chest radiotherapy, specifically, may affect the heart and coronary artery, impairing heart function and causing pathologic changes in myocardial tissues. The aim of this study is to evaluate the damage coming from these therapies with the aid of cardiac imaging. Methods: This is a single-centre, prospective clinical trial. Patients with NSCLC who are enrolled will undergo computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before chemotherapy 3 months, 6 months, and 9-12 months after the treatment. We expect to enrol 30 patients in 2 years. Conclusions: Our clinical trial will be an opportunity not only to highlight the timing and the radiation dose needed for pathological cardiac tissue changes to happen but will also provide useful data to set new follow-up schedules and strategies, keeping in mind that, more often than not, patients affected by NSCLC may present other heart- and lung-related pathological conditions.

TI  - Brain metastases: new systemic treatment approaches
T2  - MEMO-MAGAZINE OF EUROPEAN MEDICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background Brain metastases (BM) still present a clinical challenge in oncology. Treatment of BM was mainly based on local approaches including neurosurgery and radiation. However, the fraction of patients with asymptomatic BM has risen over the last decade. Recent clinical trials on immune- and targeted therapies showed promising intracranial responses-especially in neurological asymptomatic status. Therefore, systemic treatment presents an emerging therapy approach specifically in patients with asymptomatic BM. Methods The present review highlights the recent advances in systemic therapeutic and preventive approaches in BM focusing on the main BM causing tumors: non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), melanoma and breast cancer. Results Remarkable intracranial efficacies were presented for several next-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and immune checkpoint inhibitors, especially in asymptomatic BM patients. In NSCLC, osimertinib and afatinib presented intracranial response rates over 80%. Osimertinib showed even a potential for primary BM prevention. Considerable intracranial response rates were observed for the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib in BRAF mutated melanoma BM. Combined ipilimumab and nivolumab treatment in asymptomatic melanoma BM even presented with similar intra- and extracranial response rates. In breast cancer, HER2-targeted TKIs like lapatinib in combination with chemotherapy, or trastuzumab deruxtecan monotherapy presented also notable intracranial response rates. Conclusion New developments in targeted and immune-modulating therapies have postulated high intracranial efficacies in patients with BM from different solid tumors. However, more BM-specific studies and BM-specific endpoints in registration trials are warranted to underscore the role of systemic treatment in patients with BM.

AB  - Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains the predominate cause of cancer-related death worldwide. The estimate in the last decade indicates that for patients with metastatic NSCLC, the overall 5-year survival rate is only 7%. It is worthy that molecular target therapies or immunotherapy enable patients with metastatic lung cancer to prolong overall survival and associated with less frequent adverse events. However, chemotherapy alone, such as docetaxel, is correlated with limited efficacy and inevitable toxicity. Although cytotoxic chemotherapy still plays a vital role in cancer interventions, the biomarker-directed therapies that target the molecular alterations or programmed cell death 1 (PD-L1) and programmed cell ligand 1 (PD-1) pathways have substituted for chemotherapy as the standard first-line or second-line therapies for nearly half of patients with advanced NSCLC. An identifiable biomarker that predicts the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockades and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) is necessary to determine the patients who most probably benefit from immunotherapy. Evaluating the PD-L1 expression level and workable molecular alterations may be the best prediction indicator for efficacy in NSCLC. This review summarizes the effectiveness in current clinical trials guiding the patients with NSCLC using checkpoint blockades and TKIs as first-line treatment, evaluating the survival efficacy of PD-L1 expression level in selected patients treated with checkpoint blockades. Sixty-three articles about clinical trials of immunotherapy for NSCLC were identified from PubMed. All included articles were published from January 1, 2007, to January 30, 2021, and divided into different PD-L1 expression levels to analyze survival.

TI  - Advances in postoperative adjuvant targeted therapy for patients with stage ⅠB-ⅢA non-small cell lung cancer
T2  - Journal of Shanghai Jiaotong University .Medical Science
M3  - Review
AB  - As the cancer with the highest mortality rate in the world, the treatment of lung cancer has always been a difficult problem for a wide range of patients and physicians alike. Based on the degree of differentiation, morphological features and biological characteristics, lung cancer can be divided into small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The incidence of NSCLC accounts for 80% - 85%. Clinically, the treatment options of NSCLC include surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted drug therapy, immunotherapy, etc. For the patients with stage ⅠB-ⅢA NSCLC, in addition to the first choice of surgical treatment, postoperative adjuvant therapy is applied to reduce tumor recurrence and metastasis. Studies have shown that targeted drugs are efficient and safe in the adjuvant therapy for NSCLC patients, and the most attention has been given to agents that target mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene, such as epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs). At present, three generations of EGFR TKIs have been approved for clinical use. Among them, the first generation EGFR-TKIs are dominant in the research and application of adjuvant therapy. For example, erlotinib and gefitinib can prolong the disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients after surgery, and icotinib has been approved for postoperative adjuvant therapy in China because of its obvious improvement of patients' DFS. Compared with the placebo, the third generation EGFR-TKIs drug osimertinib demonstrated a more significant DFS advantage in the ADAURA trial, decreased tumor recurrence in central nervous system and brought greater benefits in DFS to patients previously treated with standard chemotherapy regime. Osimertinib or chemotherapy combined with osimertinib has therefore become the standard of care for the patients with postoperative adjuvant therapy of stage ⅠB - ⅢA NSCLC. As the third generation EGFR-TKIs new drugs, the clinical trials of almonertinib and furmonertinib for postoperative adjuvant therapy are also underway. This article systematically summarizes the structure of EGFR, the types and detection methods of EGFR gene mutations, introduces the treatment strategies of clinical use of EGFR-TKIs, and discusses the problems that may be encountered in the clinical use of EGFR-TKIs.

TI  - Impacts of post-radiotherapy lymphocyte count on progression-free and overall survival in patients with stageIIIlung cancer
T2  - THORACIC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background We evaluated the impact of thoracic radiation in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), considering the depletion of total lymphocytes, use or not of chemotherapy, and radiation doses in healthy lung tissue. Methods Patients with stage III NSCLC, ECOG 0 to 2, receiving radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy were prospectively evaluated. All patients should be treated with three-dimensional radiotherapy and received biologically effective doses (BED10 alpha/beta 10) of 48 to 80 Gy. Peripheral blood lymphocyte total counts were measured at the start of radiotherapy and at 2, 6 and 12 months after radiotherapy. Along with lymphocytes, PTV and doses of 5 Gy and 20 Gy in healthy lung tissue were also evaluated as potential factors influencing overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Results A total of 46 patients were prospectively evaluated from April 2016 to August 2019, with a median follow-up of 13 months (interquartile range, 1-39 months). The median of OS of all cohort was 22,8 months (IC 95% 17,6-28,1) and the median PFS was 19,5 months (IC 95%: 14,7-24,2). Most patients received concurrent or neoadjuvant chemotherapy (43; 93.4%). No patient received adjuvant immunotherapy. The lower the lymphocyte loss at 6 months after radiotherapy (every 100 lymphocytes/mcL), the greater the chance of PFS (HR, 0.44; 95%CI, 0.25-0.77;P = 0.004) and OS (HR, 0.83; 95%CI, 0.70-0.98;P = 0.025;P = 0.025). BED was a protective factor for both PFS (HR, 0.52; 95%CI 0.33-0.83;P = 0.0006) and OS (HR, 0.73; 95%CI 0.54-0.97;P = 0.029). Conclusions Our results suggest that lymphocyte depletion after radiotherapy reduces tumor control and survival in patients with stage III lung cancer. Radiation doses equal or higher than 60 Gy (BED(10)72 Gy) improve PFS and OS, but they negatively affect lymphocyte counts for months, which reduces survival and the potential of immunotherapy. Key pointsSignificant findings of the study Thoracic irradiation for locally advanced lung cancer depletes T lymphocytes for months. Patients whose lymphocyte loss is lower have better overall survival and progression-free survival. What this study adds It is necessary to protect the lymphocyte population, as well as other organs at risk. New forms of irradiation for large fields are needed. Furthermore, could immunotherapy before chemo-radiotherapy, with a greater number of lymphocytes, bring an even better result?

T2  - CURRENT MEDICAL IMAGING
M3  - Review
AB  - The strength of positron emission tomography (PET) lies in the application of its underlying technological and molecular biology advancements to clinical practice and pharmacological development. Currently, PET is used to identify malignant pulmonary nodules, evaluate mediastinal disease, detect distant metastasis, assess response to therapy, and identify novel oncologic drug targets. Over the last decade, PET has also increasingly influenced the management of locally advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by directing chemoradiation and surgical treatment. Although the majority of clinical trials and practice have used 2-18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) as the radiopharmaceutical agent for evaluating NSCLC, novel radiolabeled tracers, radiopharmaceutical agents, and targeted immunotherapy drugs are actively being investigated to improve the treatment of NSCLC. This review focuses on the utility of PET for diagnosing malignant pulmonary nodules, staging the extent of disease, and evaluating immuno-oncology therapies in locally advanced NSCLC.

TI  - Treatment of stage III non-small cell lung cancer in the era of immunotherapy: pathological complete response to neoadjuvant pembrolizumab and chemotherapy
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL LUNG CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for about 85% of all lung cancers. The expected 5-year survival of stage III NSCLC ranges from 13% to 36% for stage III. Due to the heterogeneity and poor efficacy of stage III patients, there is great controversy on how to optimize the therapy strategy. Immunotherapy is providing better clinical efficacy to more NSCLC patients, and is rapidly extending its range of care from advanced stage to locally advanced stage and early stage NSCLC. Due to the patient's strong treatment intention, drug availability, and a few encouraging results from clinical trials (NADIM, NCT02716038, etc.), the authors observed a case of stage III NSCLC that achieved complete remission after receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy. In view of such a satisfactory result in neoadjuvant therapy, this article discusses how comprehensive treatment for stage III NSCLC patients may be conducted and the manner in which various therapeutic techniques can be mastered in the era of immunotherapy. Immunotherapy has opened the exploratory space for finding resolutions to numerous challenges of treating stage III NSCLC. Further clinical studies and exploration of personalized treatment, guided by imaging data, and clinical and pathological biomarkers are imperative for the benefit of these patients.

TI  - A cohort study of the efficacy and safety of immune checkpoint inhibitors plus anlotinib versus immune checkpoint inhibitors alone as the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer in the real world
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL LUNG CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Anlotinib is a new multi-target tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) and has been shown to have antitumor effects and synergistic antitumor effects with immunotherapy only in animal studies and in the 2nd-line treatment in small clinical trials. A real-world study with large sample to compare the efficacy and safety of anlotinib plus immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) with ICIs alone in the multiline treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was urgently needed. Methods: The data of 535 advanced NSCLC patients were collected from January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2021. The patients were divided into 2 groups: (I) ICI monotherapy (230 patients); (II) ICI + anlotinib (305 patients). After propensity-score matching (PSM) to reduce the effects of biases and confounding variables, the progression-free survival time (PFS), occurrence of adverse events, disease control rate (DCR), and objective response rate (ORR) of the 2 groups were compared. The effects of clinical factors, including age, gender, gene mutations, tumor proportion score, metastases, and combined radiotherapy, were also analyzed. Results: After PSM, the baseline clinical characteristics were well balanced and the 2 group had a good comparability. Patients in the ICI + anlotinib group had significantly longer median PFS in both the 2nd-line treatment (7.73 vs. 4.70 months; P=0.003) and 3rd-line treatment (5.90 vs. 3.37 months; P=0.020), but the difference lacked statistical significance in the 1st-line treatment (8.40 vs. 5.20 months; P=0.229). The overall median PFS of patients in the ICI + anlotinib group was also much longer than that of patients in the ICI monotherapy group (6.37 vs. 3.90 months; P<0.001). The ICI + anlotinib group also tended to have a higher DCR, a higher ORR, and a higher probability of severe adverse drug reactions during the treatment than the ICI monotherapy group, but the differences were not statistically significant. Combining ICI + anlotinib could improve the outcomes of patients with bone metastasis. Conclusions: Anlotinib + ICI therapy could have greater efficacy in the treatment of advanced NSCLC patients than ICI monotherapy. The probability of adverse events might increase in the combined treatment, but could be controlled.

TI  - Advances and challenges in immunotherapy for non- small cell lung cancer
T2  - Chinese Journal of Clinical Oncology
M3  - Review
AB  - Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths, with high morbidity and mortality, as well as poor prognosis in China and worldwide. Despite the recent advances in surgery, irradiation, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy, the curative effect of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in advanced cancer patients is unsatisfactory, and the five-year survival rate of patients remains low. Immunotherapeutic approaches, such as checkpoint inhibitors, active vaccination, and adoptive vaccination, have been given increasing attention for the treatment of patients with NSCLC. Results of phase I clinical trials show a higher remission rate, and the outcomes of phases II and III clinical trials are under exploration. This review provides an overview of the latest advances and challenges in immunotherapy for NSCLC.

TI  - Safety and Efficacy Results of a Phase I, Open-Label Study of Concurrent and Delayed Nivolumab in Combination With <i>nab</i>-Paclitaxel and Carboplatin in Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Multicenter, phase I study of concurrent and delayed nivolumab plus nab-paclitaxel/carboplatin in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods: Chemotherapy-naive patients with advanced NSCLC (ineligible for potentially curative radiation or surgery) received nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m(2) (days 1, 8, 15) and carboplatin area under the curve 6 (day 1) intravenously every 21 days (first 4 cycles); nivolumab 5 mg/kg was administered intravenously (day 15) beginning in cycle 1 (concurrent) or cycle 3 (delayed) in separate cohorts and continued beyond the 4 chemotherapy cycles. The primary objective was to assess safety. Secondary objectives were to assess tolerability and explore antitumor activity. Results: All 32 patients received chemotherapy; 20 of 22 and 6 of 10 patients also received concurrent or delayed nivolumab, respectively. No dose-limiting toxicities were reported in the concurrent cohort; 1 dose-limiting toxicity was reported in the delayed cohort. In the concurrent cohort, 20 patients (91%) had >= 1 grade 3/4 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE), and 7 (32%) discontinued treatment due to TEAEs. In the delayed cohort, all patients had >= 1 grade 3/4 TEAE, and 2 (20%) discontinued due to TEAEs. The median progression-free and overall survival, respectively, were 10.5 and 29.3 months in the concurrent cohort and 4.1 and 8.2 months in the delayed cohort. Conclusions: The safety profile of the combination was consistent with that of individual agents and generally similar in the 2 cohorts. Efficacy outcomes in the concurrent cohort, but not in the delayed cohort, were encouraging and support the rationale for concurrent administration of nivolumab with nab-paclitaxel/carboplatin for the treatment of advanced NSCLC.

TI  - Vaccination of patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer with an optimized cryptic human telomerase reverse transcriptase peptide
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeTo evaluate the immunological and clinical response as well as the safety of the optimized peptide telomerase reverse transcriptase p572Y (TERT572Y) presented by HLA-A*0201 in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Patients and MethodsTwenty-two patients with advanced NSCLC and residual (n = 8) or progressive disease (PD; n = 14) following chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy received two subcutaneous injections of the optimized TERT572Y peptide followed by four injections of the native TERT572 peptide administered every 3 weeks. Peptide-specific immune responses were monitored by enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay and/or TERT572Y pentamer staining.ResultsTwelve (54.5%) of 22 patients completed the vaccination program. Toxicity consisted primarily of local skin reactions. TERT572-specific CD8(+) cells were detected in 16 (76.2%) of 21 patients after the second vaccination, and 10 (90.9%) of 11 patients after the sixth vaccination. Stable disease (SD) occurred in eight (36.4%) of 22 vaccinated patients, with three (13.6%) having had PD before entering the study. The median duration of SD was 11.2 months. After a median follow-up of 10.0 months, patients with early developed immunological response ( n = 16) had a significantly longer time to progression and overall survival (OS) than nonresponders (n = 5; log-rank tests P = .046 and P = .012, respectively). The estimated median OS was 30.0 months ( range, 2.8 to 40.0 months) and 4.1 months (range, 2.4 to 10.9 months) for responders and nonresponders, respectively.ConclusionTERT572Y peptide vaccine is well tolerated and effective in eliciting a specific T cell immunity. Immunological response is associated with prolonged survival. These results are encouraging and warrant further evaluation in a randomized study.

TI  - The Riddle of the Sphinx: Progress in Leptomeningeal Metastasis of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
T2  - CLINICAL MEDICINE INSIGHTS-ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Leptomeningeal metastasis (LM) is a serious complication of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and the incidence of LM has been increasing yearly in recent times. There is no consensus on the best treatment modality for LM, which underscores a difficult problem in the management of advanced NSCLC patients. The existing treatments include molecular targeted therapy, systemic chemotherapy, local radiotherapy, antivascular tumor therapy, intrathecal chemotherapy, and immunotherapy, but their efficacy is not satisfactory. In this article, we briefly describe the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of NSCLC-LM and discuss progress regarding evaluation of the efficacy of LM treatment to better provide a necessary reference for clinical practice and clinical trial evaluation.

TI  - Association of the Metabolic Score Using Baseline FDG-PET/CT and dNLR with Immunotherapy Outcomes in Advanced NSCLC Patients Treated with First-Line Pembrolizumab
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: We aimed to assess the clinical utility of a previously published score combining the total metabolic tumor volume (TMTV) on baseline FDG-PET/CT and pretreatment derived from the neutrophils to lymphocytes ratio (dNLR) for prognostication in NSCLC patients undergoing first-line immunotherapy (IT).Methods: In this multicenter retrospective study, 63 advanced NSCLC patients with a PD-L1 tumor proportion score (TPS) >= 50%, who underwent FDG-PET/CT before first-line IT, treated from January 2017 to September 2019, were enrolled. Associations between this score and the progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), disease control rate (DCR), and overall response rate (ORR) were evaluated.Results: The median (m) PFS and mOS were 7.7 (95% CI 4.9-10.6) and 12.1 (8.6-15.6) months, respectively, and DCR and ORR were 65% and 58%, respectively. mOS was 17.9 months (14.6 not reached) for the good group versus 13.8 (95%CI 8.4-18.9) and 6.6 (CI 2.0-11.2) months for the intermediate and poor groups, respectively. mPFS was 15.1 (95%CI 12.1-20.0) months for the good group versus 5.2 (1.9-8.5) and 1.9 (95%CI 1.3-2.5) months for the intermediate and poor groups, respectively. The poor prognosis group was associated with DCR and ORR (p< 0.05).Conclusions: The metabolic score combining TMTV on the baseline FDG-PET/CT scan and pretreatment dNLR was associated with the survival and response in a cohort of advanced NSCLC patients with >= 50% PD-L1 receiving frontline IT.

TI  - A phase II study of S-1 and cisplatin with concurrent thoracic radiotherapy followed by durvalumab for unresectable, locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer in Japan (SAMURAI study): primary analysis
T2  - THERAPEUTIC ADVANCES IN MEDICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The standard of care for unresectable, locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC) is chemoradiotherapy (CRT) followed by durvalumab, based on the PACIFIC study. Although multiple Japanese phase II studies have shown high efficacy and tolerability of CRT with cisplatin plus S-1 (SP), no prospective study using durvalumab after SP-based CRT has been reported.Objectives: We conducted a multicenter phase II study of this approach, the interim analysis of which showed a high transition rate to durvalumab consolidation therapy. Here, we report the primary analysis results.Design: In treatment-naive LA-NSCLC, cisplatin (60 mg/m(2), day 1) and S-1 (80-120 mg/body, days 1-14) were administered with two 4-week cycles with concurrent thoracic radiotherapy (60 Gy) followed by durvalumab (10 mg/kg) every 2 weeks for up to 1 year.Methods: The primary endpoint was 1-year progression-free survival (PFS). The expected 1-year PFS and its lower limit of the 80% confidence interval (CI) were set as 63% and 47%, respectively, based on the results of TORG1018 study.Results: In all, 59 patients were enrolled, with 51 (86.4%) proceeding to durvalumab. The objective response rate throughout the study was 72.9% (95% CI: 59.7-83.6%). After median follow-up of 21.9 months, neither median PFS nor OS was reached. The 1-year PFS was 72.5% (80% CI: 64.2-79.2%, 95% CI: 59.1-82.2%), while the 1-year overall survival was 91.5% (95% CI: 80.8-96.4%). No grade 5 adverse events were observed throughout the study. The most common adverse event during the consolidation phase was pneumonitis (any grade, 78.4%; grade > 3, 2.0%). Eventually, 52.5% of patients completed 1-year durvalumab consolidation therapy from CRT initiation.Conclusion: This study of durvalumab after SP-based CRT met its primary endpoint and found a 1-year PFS of 73% from CRT initiation. This study provides the first prospective data on the prognosis and tolerability of durvalumab consolidation from the initiation of CRT.

TI  - Identification of Epigenetic Regulators Mediating Resistance to FGFR Inhibition in Squamous Cell Carcinoma
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACTSquamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) is a common cancer that develops in stratified epithelial tissues such as theepidermis, the oral cavity, and the lungs. Standard treatments for patients with un-resectable SCC, whichinclude radiation, cis-platin, 5-fluorouracil, and paclitaxel, are only modestly effective, resulting in approximately45,000 deaths every year. While there has been some progress in the development of target therapies, suchas EGFR inhibition, these treatments have not shown the efficacy seen in other tumors such as lungAdenocarcinoma. Recent advances in immunotherapy have shown great promise in treating SCC, even atadvanced stage, but like many other tumor types only a minority of SCC patients respond to immunotherapy.In addition, the risk of cutaneous SCC is greatly increased in immunosuppressed transplant recipients, who arepoor candidates for immunotherapy. This project aims to identify novel therapeutic targets that mediateresistance to FGFR inhibition in SCC. We will employ an orthotopic transplant model system that is driven bygenetic alterations commonly found in human SCC tumors. A drop-out screen using a CRISPR/Cas9 librarywill be performed in vivo using orthotopic tumors. Hits will be validated using in vitro and in vivo SCC modelsystems employing either shRNA or CRISPR/Cas9-based target gene knockdown, as well as availableantibody-based or small molecule inhibitors. In addition, we will validate the expression of potential targetshuman SCC tumors by Tissue Microarray, which will help to identify clinical characteristics of patients that maybenefit from this therapeutic strategy. There are many drugs that are FDA-approved or in clinical trials thathave not been tested for cooperation with FGFR inhibition, and thus this un-biased approach is likely touncover unexpected vulnerabilities that can be rapidly translated into treatments for SCC patients.

TI  - Harnessing Allo-immunity to Enhance Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Responses in Advanced NSCLC
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - This application seeks to conduct a phase Ib proof-of-concept clinical trial at the Houston VA Lung PrecisionOncology Program (LPOP) to determine if intratumor injections with pooled human immunoglobulins (IVIG) plusan immune adjuvant are safe. Patients with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who receive immunecheckpoint inhibitors (ICIs) show treatment resistance. Solid tumors fail to establish in unrelated hosts becauseof the host’s antibodies that deposit immune complexes and activate local antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in thetumor. Further, established tumors from related donors injected with alloantibodies plus an adjuvant, poly-IC, apotent TLR-3 agonist, abrogated the original tumors and their distant metastasis in mice. In a single phase I study,patients with solid tumors refractory to ICIs tolerated multiple intratumoral (IT) and intramuscular (IM) injectionswith a stabilized form of poly-IC, such as poly-ICLC, (Hiltonol®; Oncovir Inc, USA). However, whether IVIGintratumor injections can cause immune complex formation and, combined with TLR-3 agonists, can enhanceICIs in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), remains unknown. Our preliminary dataindicate that IVIG (Hizentra®) binds to antigens found in human NSCLC, indicating that like the preclinical models,intratumor injection with IVIG could induce immune complexes, inducing antitumor responses. We will test ouroverarching hypothesis that IT injection of IVIG + poly-ICLC and IM injection of poly-ICLC to boost APCs, aresafe and can activate antitumor immunity in patients with advanced NSCLC with the following Specific Aims:Specific Aim 1: To determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose of intratumor injection of animmune adjuvant plus alloantibodies in veterans with advanced NSCLC. Hypothesis: a combination ofintratumor (IT) injections of IVIG + poly-ICLC, and IM injections of poly-ICLC are safe in patients with advanced-stage NSCLC. We plan to conduct a first-in-human phase Ib single-center study at the Lung Precision OncologyProgram (LPOP) MEDVAMC site titled: Harnessing Allo-Immunity To Enhance Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors inAdvanced NSCLC (HAITEN-ICI). The study objective will be to evaluate the safety of, and maximum tolerateddose (MTD) of IT injections of a peripherally accessible metastatic site with IVIG + poly-ICLC followed by IMpoly-ICLC in veterans with stage IV NSCLC (N=16) who are eligible to receive systemic ICIs monotherapy. Theprimary endpoint includes assessment of an MTD dose for IT injection of IVIG + poly-ICLC, and IM injection ofpoly-ICLC given in combination with ICI in the same cohort. Specific Aim 2: To determine the progression-free survival in response to immune adjuvant plus alloantibodies in veterans with advanced NSCLC.Hypothesis: compared to standard of care (SOC), poly-ICLC + IVIG improve progression-free survival in patientswith advanced NSCLC receiving ICI. If our proof-of-concept pilot study conducted as part of Aim 1 shows nosafety concerns, and we identify MTD, we will proceed with a phase II multi-center randomized clinical trial todetermine the safety and progression-free survival (PFS) in veterans with advanced NSCLC treated withintertumoral IVIG + poly-ICLC, compared to SOC. Specific Aim 3: To explore immune responses in pre-andpost-intratumor treatment with IVIG + poly-ICLC in Phase Ib & II cohorts. Hypothesis: intratumor injectionsusing IVIG + poly-ICLC activates adaptive immune responses in advanced NSCLC patients. We will examinepre-, mid-and post-treatment systemic immune activation in comparison with baseline in patients enrolled in pilotphase Ib and if safe, in phase II study. We will compare pre- and post-therapy immune responses using state-of-the-art technologies for locoregional tumors. The proposed two-stage clinical trial is a novel approach todetermine if inducing tumor-specific immune responses can enhance systemic ICI treatment and improve clinicaloutcomes for veterans with advanced NSCLC. Therefore, a combined treatment with an immune adjuvant suchas poly-ICLC, plus IVIG could provide a novel approach to overcoming the tumor-suppressive microenvironment.

TI  - Quantitative CD3 PET Imaging Predicts Tumor Growth Response to Anti-CTLA-4 Therapy
T2  - JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Immune checkpoint inhibitors have made rapid advances, resulting in multiple Food and Drug Administration-approved therapeutics that have markedly improved survival. However, these benefits are limited to a minority subpopulation that achieves a response. Predicting which patients are most likely to benefit would be valuable for individual therapy optimization. T-cell markers such as CD3 by examining active recruitment of the T cells responsible for cancer-cell death represent a more direct approach to monitoring tumor immune response than pretreatment biopsy or genetic screening. This approach could be especially effective as numerous different therapeutic strategies emerge, decreasing the need for drug-specific biomarkers and instead focusing on T-cell infiltration, which has been previously correlated with treatment response. Methods: A CD3 PET imaging agent targeting T cells was synthesized to test the role of such imaging as a predictive marker. The Zr-89-p-isothiocyanatobenzyldeferoxamine-CD3 PET probe was assessed in a murine tumor xenograft model of anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) immunotherapy of colon cancer. Results: Imaging on day 14 revealed 2 distinct groups of mice stratified by PET signal intensity. Although there was no significant difference in tumor volume on the day of imaging, in the high-uptake group subsequent measurements revealed significantly smaller tumors than in either the low-uptake group or the untreated controls. In contrast, there was no significant difference in the size of tumors between the low-uptake and untreated control mice. Conclusion: These findings indicate that high CD3 PET uptake in the anti-CTLA-4-treated mice correlated with subsequent reduced tumor volume and was a predictive biomarker of response.

TI  - Progress in immune microenvironment and immunotherapy of driver gene negative advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients with brain metastases
T2  - Chinese Journal of Clinical Oncology
M3  - Review
AB  - Distant metastases are inevitable in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC),and the brain is one of the most common site of metastasis.Patients who suffer brain metastases (BM) may have headaches,blurred vision,hemiplegia,limb numbness,and other symptoms.Quality of life is severely impacted for these patients.Previous studies have shown that prognosis for patients with BM is usually very poor,and natural median survival time is only about 3 months.Traditional treatment strategies for driver-gene negative NSCLC patients with BM include local intervention surgery,radiotherapy,and systemic chemotherapy.New generation targeted drugs can be used for patients with gene mutations such as EGFR,ALK,and ROS1.However,the efficacy of both approaches has not been optimized in patients with BM.Immunotherapy based on immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has brought new hope to patients with advanced NSCLC.A large number of randomized clinical trials have shown that the application of ICIs on melanoma and NSCLC patients with BM can produce amazing anti-tumor effects compared with chemotherapy.Studies have confirmed that the vasculature in BM is significantly different from normal cerebral vasculature.BM also establish a unique tumor microenvironment,and unique immune cell components and functions.The characteristics of immune cells infiltrating metastases are different from those infiltrating primary lesions.In addition,several retrospective studies have found that either immune-monotherapy or combined immunotherapy is effective in lung cancer patients with BM.Research into predictive biomarkers for assessing the efficacy of immunotherapy is hampered by the difficulty of obtaining brain tissue samples.In addition to programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression in tumor cells,tumor mutation burden (TMB) may be a potential biomarker to predict the efficacy of immunotherapy.This review focuses on tumor microenvironment of NSCLC metastases,and surveys progress in ICI therapies,to provide a reference for the treatment of NSCLC patients with BM.

TI  - Salvage surgery after definitive chemoradiotherapy for patients with non-small cell lung cancer
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL LUNG CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT) has been a standard of care for patients with unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, locoregional recurrence occurs in about 30% of patients after definitive CRT. Recently, the addition of durvalumab as maintenance therapy has shown to improve the outcome of these patients. However, locoregional recurrence will still remain. "Salvage surgery" has been performed to achieve local control in clinical practice, although its clinical significance is unclear. In this review, we define salvage surgery as lung resection for local control of the tumor which was not planned initially, after failure or insufficient treatment effect of the initial CRT for locally advanced cancer and evaluated nine studies to gain some insights on its role in the treatment of lung cancer. The time from radiotherapy (RT) to salvage surgery varied considerably (range, 3 to 282 weeks). Salvage surgery was performed for persistent disease (47%) and locoregional recurrence (52%). Lobectomy (63%) and mediastinal lymph node dissections (90%) were the most common procedures. However, the rate of pneumonectomy was higher in salvage surgery (28%) compared to that in lung resection in general. The median morbidity was 41% (range, 15% to 62%) and the mortality was 4% (range, 0 to 11%) which appeared acceptable. The median recurrence-free survival and overall survival (OS) after salvage surgery ranged from 10 to 22 months and 13 to 76 months, respectively. Favorable prognostic factors of salvage surgery were longer period from RT to salvage surgery and radiological downstaging. The pathological response was also prognostic, although this information cannot be obtained preoperatively. We conclude that salvage surgery can be considered especially for those with late local recurrence or those with the metabolic response. Given the condition where phase III trials are difficult, the accumulation of real-world evidence in a prospective fashion will be necessary.

AB  - Overall SummaryApproximately 50% of cancer patients are treated with radiation therapy (RT), but local recurrence can still occureven with the use of advanced RT techniques. This local recurrence, which commonly develops in 30-50% ofcancer cases, is exacerbated by the acquisition of RT resistance. This RT resistance is especially true forpatients with locally advanced thoracic cancers, such as lung and esophageal cancers. RT can lead to an iron-dependent cell death modality, called ferroptosis, but whether ferroptosis resistance occurs within tumors givingrise to acquired RT resistance is not known and is the central theme of the proposed Acquired Resistance toTherapy and Iron (ARTI) Center. The overarching goals of the ARTI Center are: 1) to bridge the basic sciencemechanisms of ferroptosis in acquired resistance with translational research in preclinical models and humanpatient samples; 2) to identify cohorts of patients who are at greatest risk to develop acquired RT resistance;and 3) to investigate the ability of novel therapeutic agents to re-sensitize lung and esophageal cancer cells toradiation by inducing ferroptosis. The ARTI Center comprises two basic/mechanistic projects (Project 1 andProject 2), one preclinical/translational project (Project 3), and one shared resource core (Molecular ImagingCore [MIC]). Project 1 will focus on elucidating whether ferroptosis evasion is a key driver in acquired RTresistance using radioresistant lung cancer and esophageal cancer cell lines and xenograft models that will beused in Project 2. Project 2 will test the hypothesis that hypoxia, a long-recognized driver of tumorradioresistance, suppresses ferroptosis induction during RT and contributes to RT-induced acquired resistanceto ferroptosis. Furthermore, expression of hypoxia-related genes and other targets of acquired RT resistance willbe analyzed by single-cell sequencing in Project 3. Project 3 investigates changes in immune cells in the tumormicroenvironment of humanized tumor models derived from chemoradiation therapy-responsive or -non-responsive esophageal adenocarcinoma patients. These ferroptosis-mediated immunologic changes in thetumor microenvironment may serve as prognostic biomarkers for identifying tumors that may acquire RTresistance and predicting cancer patient outcomes, which could, in the future, be modulated by the ferroptosis-inducing agents tested in Projects 1 and 2. Projects 1, 2, and 3 will be supported by the MIC that utilizesbioluminescence imaging to monitor tumor growth, positron emission tomography (PET) tracers to monitorcystine transporter activity and to identify hypoxic regions within tumors, as well as novel, redox-tuned PETtracers for identifying activated innate immune cells. The ARTI Center will develop an Administrative Core foreffective communication and collaboration between the ARTI Center Project and Core Leaders and Co-Leaderswith National Cancer Institute (NCI) of Acquired Resistance to Therapy Network (ARTNet) program staff as wellas other ARTNet centers to synergize ARTI Center-related activities.

AB  - PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Metastatic melanoma is a lethal skin cancer with response rates to chemotherapy of only 5-20%, and although immunotherapy (Proleukin and Yervoy) provides an alternative option that can produce durable responses and long-term survival, as currently used, immunotherapy only provides a benefit in a small proportion of patients. A newer targeted agent, vemurafenib (PLX4032), is a B-Raf kinase inhibitor that can produce remarkable responses in melanoma harboring the BRAFV600E mutation, but following the initial response, drug resistance allows the recurrence of aggressive malignant disease after only a few months.

TI  - Novel Targets for Immunotherapy

AB  - Our laboratory has identified and characterized the T-box transcription factor brachyury as a driver of cancer plasticity and tumor resistance to various therapeutics. We have shown that brachyury is expressed in various types of carcinomas, including lung, triple negative breast, colon, small cell lung carcinomas, germ cell tumors (both embryonal and seminomas), and the rare tumor type chordoma. In collaboration with the private sector, we have now developed three brachyury-targeting cancer vaccine platforms, which are currently undergoing clinical evaluation, including (1) a yeast-brachyury vaccine; (2) an adenovirus-brachyury vaccine; and (3) a poxviral vector-based vaccine expressing the transgenes for brachyury and three human costimulatory molecules (B7-1, ICAM-1, and LFA-3, designated TRICOM). Recently, a Phase I trial of a Modified Vaccine Ankara (MVA) priming vaccine followed by a fowlpox virus boosting vaccine encoding brachyury and TRICOM has been completed in patients with advanced solid tumors. The results of this trial showed the development of brachyury-specific T cells and T cells against the "cascade antigens" CEA and MUC1 in the majority of patients, in the absence of toxicities. Similarly, a Phase I trial of a multi-targeted recombinant Adenovirus 5-based vaccine encoding brachyury, CEA and MUC1 was completed, demonstrating the generation of T-cell responses against all three antigens in the majority of patients, without any evidence of antigenic competition or toxicity. The study of brachyury as a tumor-associated antigen and its role as a driver of cancer plasticity led our laboratory to demonstrate that carcinoma cells bearing mesenchymal features may also be resistant to the cytotoxic effect of immune effector cells. These observations led us to investigate novel therapeutic modalities that could modify the phenotype of a tumor from mesenchymal to epithelial, in an attempt to improve the tumor's susceptibility to immune attack. As multiple tumor extrinsic factors, including cytokines, chemokines and growth factors, could induce EMT or plasticity in cancer cells, we are investigating whether blockade of such factors may revert the phenotype and resistance of the tumor. Our laboratory has shown that the chemokine IL-8 promotes the acquisition of mesenchymal features, stem-cell like properties, resistance to therapies, and the recruitment of immune-suppressive cells to the tumor site. Previous studies conducted in our laboratory with a clinical-grade monoclonal antibody that neutralizes IL-8 (HuMax-IL8), showed that blockade of IL-8 can (1) revert tumor plasticity in models of triple negative breast cancer, both in vitro and in vivo; (2) significantly decrease the recruitment of granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (G-MDSCs) at the tumor site; and (3) enhance the susceptibility of breast cancer cells to immune-mediated lysis with NK and antigen-specific T cells in vitro. Recently, a Phase I clinical study has been completed at the NIH Clinical Center on the use of HuMax-IL8 in patients with metastatic or unresectable locally advanced solid tumors, showing safety and reductions in IL-8 levels in serum at all doses evaluated. One of the tumor types with a high degree of infiltration with G-MDSCs is head and neck carcinoma (HNSCC), a tumor type where IL-8 has also been shown to be relevant to the biology of the disease. In collaboration with Dr. C. Allen (NIDCD), we have evaluated the potential effect of IL-8 signaling blockade via inhibition with a small molecule inhibitor of IL-8 receptors, CXCR1 and CXCR2, in models of HNSCC. The results of these studies demonstrated that inhibition of CXCR1/2 can decrease tumor accumulation of G-MDSCs and enhance the efficacy of PD-1 axis immune checkpoint blockade and adoptive cell transfer of engineered T cells or NK cells. In addition to IL-8, transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) is a master regulator of tumor plasticity, in addition to mediating tumor immune suppression. In an attempt to overcome tumor escape mechanisms mediated by these two cytokines, we recently investigated the combined use of a CXCR1/2 inhibitor and a bifunctional agent that simultaneously blocks programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and 'traps' soluble TGF-beta (bintrafusp alfa). We showed that simultaneous inhibition of CXCR1/2, TGF-beta, and PD-L1 signaling synergizes to reduce mesenchymal tumor features in murine models of breast and lung cancer, and to markedly enhance the expression of tumor epithelial markers while reducing infiltration with suppressive G-MDSCs, significantly enhancing T-cell infiltration and activation in tumors, and leading to improved anti-tumor activity. These studies highlight the potential benefit of combined blockade of CXCR1/2 and TGF-beta signaling for modulation of tumor plasticity and potential enhancement of tumor responses to PD-L1 blockade. Additional studies are being conducted in our laboratory to evaluate the use of IL-8 neutralizing antibodies or the small molecule inhibitor of CXCR1/2 in combination with various immunotherapeutic agents including checkpoint inhibitor antibodies, vaccines and other modulatory agents.

TI  - Management of Non-Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) with Driver Gene Alterations: An Evolving Scenario
T2  - CURRENT ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The ever-growing knowledge regarding NSCLC molecular biology has brought innovative therapies into clinical practice; however, the treatment situation in the non-metastatic setting is rapidly evolving. Indeed, immunotherapy-based perioperative treatments are currently considered the standard of care for patients with resectable NSCLC in the absence of EGFR mutations or ALK gene rearrangements. Recently, data have been presented on the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in the adjuvant and locally advanced setting for patients with NSCLC harboring such driver gene alterations. The aim of the current work is to review the available evidence on the use of targeted treatments in the non-metastatic setting, together with a summary of the ongoing trials designed for actionable gene alterations other than EGFR and ALK. To date, 3-year adjuvant osimertinib treatment has been demonstrated to improve DFS and OS and to reduce CNS recurrence in resected EGFR-mutated NSCLC in stage IB-IIIA (TNM 7th edition). The use of osimertinib after chemo-radiation in stage III unresectable EGFR-mutated NSCLC showed the relevant PFS improvement. In the ALK-positive setting, 2-year alectinib treatment was shown to clearly improve DFS compared to adjuvant standard chemotherapy in resected NSCLC with stage IB (>= 4 cm)-IIIA (TNM 7th edition). Several trials are ongoing to establish the optimal adjuvant TKI treatment duration, as well as neoadjuvant TKI strategies in EGFR- and ALK-positive disease, and (neo)adjuvant targeted treatments in patients with actionable gene alterations other than EGFR or ALK. In conclusion, our review depicts how the current treatment scenario is expected to rapidly change in the context of non-metastatic NSCLC with actionable gene alterations, hence appropriate molecular testing from the early stages has become crucial to establish the most adequate approaches both in the perioperative and the locally advanced disease.

AB  - DEVELOPMENTAL THERAPEUTICS (DT) RESEARCH PROGRAMPROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACTThe Developmental Therapeutics (DT) Research Program develops and evaluates novel therapeutics andcombinations that: 1) overcome drug resistance of cancer cells mediated by a spectrum of genetic andepigenetic mechanisms; 2) inhibit growth and drug-resistant pathways of cancer; and 3) utilize novel immunecheckpoint therapeutics to increase the proportion of cancer patients who benefit. The overall approach of theDT Program is to leverage the creativity and expertise of basic scientists in the Case Comprehensive CancerCenter (Case CCC) Programs by analyzing new agents for specific validated molecular targets and newtherapeutic compounds for preclinical and clinical validation in early-phase clinical trials. DT members guidetheir development, and convey clinical samples back to laboratory investigators to drive further discovery. Thisbidirectional interchange enables DT's continued role as a major convener of new therapeutic concepts for theCenter’s Programs. The program is organized around 3 scientific aims: (1) Interrogate cancer pathways todevelop new efficacious therapeutics; (2) Implement early-phase clinical trials around novel pathway targets,new agents and combinatorial approaches; and (3) Implement early-phase trials around novel approaches tocancer immunotherapies, to widen their activity spectra. These aims reflect major working groups andinitiatives that coalesces program members with other cancer center investigators through inter-programmaticcollaborations that result in preclinical and clinical research efforts, grants, and trial protocols. Extensive use ofan array of shared resources, in particular Translational, Cytometry, Imaging, Proteomics, and Drug Discoveryfacilitate all aspects of member discoveries.Under the leadership of Yogen Saunthararajah (Co-Leader) and John Letterio (Co-Leader) the DT Programhas 52 members including 18 full, 5 associate and 29 clinical members representing 21 different departmentsacross the consortium. Members are funded by a total of $12.5M in research grant funding (annual directcosts), of which $5.1M is peer-reviewed and $2.9M is NCI-funded. Between 2012 and 2016, DT programmembers published 1,012 publications. Cancer and program related publications included 35% inter-programmatic, 25% intra-programmatic, 14% inter- and intra-programmatic and 10% that involvedcollaborations with another Cancer Center. This highly effective Program has made major practice-changingcontributions benefiting cancer patients. Examples include: discoveries of first-in-class compounds(SMARCA5 inhibitor, PP2A activator, malate dehydrogenase inhibitor, base excision repair target withmethoxyamine); discoveries targeting EGFR resistance, inhibition of uracil glycosylase and the inhibition of theBH4 domain of Bcl-2; analysis into the genetic markers of resistance to radiation; and identification of severalsmall cell lung cancer genetic subsets.!

TI  - Costs and Cost Drivers Associated with Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer Patients Who Received Two or More Lines of Therapy in Europe
T2  - CLINICOECONOMICS AND OUTCOMES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (aNSCLC; stage IIIB/IV) presents a substantial clinical burden to society; reliable estimates of its economic burden are lacking. Therefore, this study aimed to quantify real-world health care resource utilization (HCRU) and costs of patients with squamous (SQ) and non-SQ (NSQ) aNSCLC who received two or more lines of treatment (2L+) in Europe, and to describe cost-predictors.Methods: The LENS (Leading the Evaluation of Non-squamous and Squamous NSCLC) retrospective chart review study collected data from 2L+ patients with aNSCLC diagnosed between 07/2009 and 08/2011 (wave 1) or 07/2010 and 09/2012 (wave 2) in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, England, the Netherlands, and Sweden. Patients were followed from diagnosis through most recent visit/death. A weighted average of countryspecific unit costs (2018 Euro) was applied to systemic anti-cancer therapy usage and HCRU (hospital/emergency department visit, surgery, radiotherapy, ancillary care, biomarker testing) to determine the total cost from aNSCLC diagnosis to death. Generalized linear models (gamma distribution, log link) were used to assess clinical and demographic predictors.Results: Of 973 2L+ aNSCLC patients, median overall survival (OS) was 1.5 years from advanced diagnosis (range: 0.2-5.3; median OS: 1.4 [SQ], 1.6 [NSQ]), 79.0% died during follow-up. Weighted mean total per-patient costs were (sic)21,273, ranging from (sic)17,761 (England) to (sic)30,854 (Sweden), and (sic)15,446 (SQ) to (sic)26,477 (NSQ). Systemic drug costs comprised 77.4% of total costs. Insurance status, presence of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation, SQ histology, age, alcohol abuse, and year of diagnosis were significant predictors for lower total costs per patient-month, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) >= 1 and country for higher costs.Conclusion: In the era pre-immunotherapy, HCRU and costs were substantial in aNSCLC 2L+ patients, with most of the costs accrued prior to start of 2L. NSQ patients incurred significantly higher total costs than SQ patients in all participating countries.

T2  - Zhonghua yi xue za zhi
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objective: To explore the expression of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) in patients with locally advanced and non-EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC) undergoing concurrent chemoradiotherapy (cCRT) and its association with clinical outcome of patients. Methods: The basic clinical information of 19 patients with unresectable, non-EGFR mutated LA-NSCLC receiving radical cCRT in Cancer Hospital Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences from January 2016 to December 2017 was retrospectively analyzed. The rabbit monoclonal antibody SP263 was used for immunohistochemical analysis to detect the expression of PD-L1 in LA-NSCLC tissues and the tumor proportion score (TPS) equal to or greater than 1% was defined as PD-L1 positive. The associations between PD-L1 ≥1% and PD-L1 ≥25% with the clinical characteristics and clinical outcome of LA-NSCLC patients were evaluated respectively. Results: Among 19 LA-NSCLC patients, 13 had PD-L1 positive expression, and 4 had PD-L1 expression greater than or equal to 25%. No significant difference was observed between patients with PD-L1 positive and negative expressions regarding the distribution of age, smoking history, pathological classification, and TNM staging (P>0.05). A total of 15 patients could be evaluated for therapeutic effect, including 7 patients with partial response (PR), 7 patients with stable disease (SD), and 1 patient with progressive disease (PD). In the group with PD-L1 expression<1%, 3 patients were in objective response, and 4 patients were in disease control. In the group with PD-L1 expression ≥1%, 4 patients were in objective response, and 10 patients were in disease control. When the PD-L1 expression was less than 25%, 6 patients gained the objective response, and 11 patients gained the disease control. When the PD-L1 expression was greater than or equal to 25%, 1 patient gained the objective response, and 3 patients gained the disease control. The median overall survival (OS) was 35 (95%CI: 12.7-57.3) months for patients with PD-L1 ≥1% and 40 (95%CI: not reaching the end point) months for patients with PD-L1<1% (P=0.284). Patients with PD-L1 ≥25% had a median survival time of 12 (95%CI:0.0-34.5) months, and patients with PD-L1<25% had a median survival time of 40 (95%CI: 27.4-52.6) months (P=0.241). Conclusions: The prognosis of LA-NSCLC patients with PD-L1 positive and no-EGFR mutation receiving concurrent chemoradiation has a trend of poor prognosis. A larger sample size study is warranted to explore the prognostic value of PD-L1 expression in inoperable LA-NSCLC patients and to further explore the effect of immunotherapy on patients with different PD-L1 expression levels.
AB  - 目的： 探讨程序性细胞死亡配体1（PD-L1）在同步放化疗非表皮生长因子受体（EGFR）突变局部晚期非小细胞肺癌（NSCLC）中的表达及其与患者预后的关系。 方法： 回顾性分析中国医学科学院肿瘤医院放疗科2016年1月至2017年12月收治的根治性同步放化疗非EGFR突变局部晚期不可手术的19例NSCLC患者的临床资料。采用免疫组化方法以兔单克隆抗体SP263检测PD-L1在NSCLC组织中的表达，以肿瘤阳性细胞比例≥1%为PD-L1阳性表达，分别分析PD-L1表达≥1%和≥25%与NSCLC患者临床特征和预后的关系。 结果： 19例NSCLC患者中，PD-L1阳性表达13例，其中PD-L1表达≥25%者4例。PD-L1表达≥1%和PD-L1表达<1%组年龄、吸烟史、病理类型和TNM分期差异均无统计学意义（均P>0.05）。15例患者可进行疗效评价，其中部分缓解（PR）7例，疾病稳定（SD）7例，疾病进展（PD）1例。PD-L1表达<1%组患者客观缓解3例，疾病控制4例；PD-L1表达≥1%组患者客观缓解4例，疾病控制10例。PD-L1表达<25%组患者客观缓解6例，疾病控制11例；PD-L1表达≥25%组患者客观缓解1例，疾病控制3例。PD-L1表达≥1%组患者的中位生存时间为35个月（95%CI：12.7~57.3个月），PD-L1表达<1%组患者的中位生存时间为40个月（95%CI未达终点），差异无统计学意义（P=0.284）；PD-L1≥25%组患者的中位生存时间为12个月（95%CI：0.0~34.5个月），PD-L1<25%组患者的中位生存时间为40个月（95%CI：27.4~52.6个月），差异无统计学意义（P=0.241）。 结论： PD-L1阳性接受同步放化疗非EGFR突变局部晚期NSCLC患者的预后有不良趋势，有必要扩大样本量探索PD-L1在局部晚期不可手术NSCLC患者中的预后意义，并探讨免疫治疗对不同PD-L1表达水平患者的疗效。.

TI  - Clinical advances in EGFR-TKI combination therapy for EGFR-mutated NSCLC: a narrative review
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Background and Objective: Mutations located in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase domains have been described as the 'Achilles heel' of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and can be targeted by epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs). However, the clinical benefits of EGFR-TKIs are limited, and drug resistance inevitably occurs in NSCLC patients after long-term exposure to certain drugs. EGFR-TKI combination therapies, including combined targeted therapy, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy, have shown promise in addressing this issue. This literature review analyzed the rationale and controversies of clinical research related to various EGFR-TKI combination therapies.Methods: The PubMed database was searched to retrieve articles published from January 1, 2001 to April 15, 2023 using the following Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms: "EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer" and "clinical trial". Google Scholar was also reviewed to retrieve additional articles. The search was limited to articles published in English.Key Content and Findings: In this review, we summarized EGFR-TKI combination therapies, including combined targeted therapy, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy, most of which have shown efficacy and safety in patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC. A number of clinical studies with large sample sizes have analyzed the activity and toxicity of combined therapies and explored potential and well-tolerated treatment options.Conclusions: EGFR mutations have been detected in many NSCLC patients and can be targeted by EGFR-TKIs. However, drug resistance after long-term exposure remains a significant challenge for this type of treatment. Most clinical trials have shown that the combination of EGFR-TKIs and targeted therapy, chemotherapy, radiotherapy or immunotherapy is efficacious and safe in the treatment of EGFR-mutated NSCLC. It should be noted that in some instances, serious adverse events have led to the termination of trials. However, EGFR-TKI combination therapy is indeed an effective approach for the treatment of patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC and deserves further development.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the impact of peripheral blood inflammatory indicators on the efficacy of immunotherapy in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) complicated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Methods: A retrospective cohort study was performed to include 178 patients with Ⅲ-Ⅳ NSCLC complicated with COPD who received at least 2 times of immunotherapy in Xinqiao Hospital of the Army Medical University from January 2019 to August 2021. Baseline peripheral blood inflammatory indicators such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were collected within 2 weeks before the first treatment, with the last one being on or before February 7, 2022. X-tile software was used to determine the optimal cut-off value of peripheral blood inflammatory indicators. The Cox multivariate regression models were used to analyze the factors affecting progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Results: Among the 178 patients, there were 174 males (97.8%) and 4 females (2.2%); the age ranged from 42 to 86 (64.3±8.3) years old.There were 30 cases (16.9%) of immunotherapy monotherapy, 114 cases (64.0%) of immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy, 21 cases (11.8%) of immunotherapy combined with antivascular therapy, and 13 cases (7.3%) of immunotherapy combined with radiotherapy. The median follow-up period was 14.5 months (95%CI: 13.6-15.3 months). The objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) were 44.9% (80/178) and 90.4% (161/178) for the whole group, the median PFS was 14.6 months (95%CI: 11.6-17.6 months), and the median OS was 25.7 months (95%CI: 18.0-33.4 months). The results of Cox multivariate analysis showed that IL-6>9.9 ng/L (HR=5.885, 95%CI: 2.558-13.543, P<0.01), TNF-alpha>8.8 ng/L (HR=3.213, 95%CI: 1.468-7.032, P=0.003), IL-8>202 ng/L (HR=2.614, 95%CI: 1.054-6.482, P=0.038), systemic immune inflammatory index (SII)>2 003.95 (HR=2.976, 95%CI: 1.647-5.379, P<0.001) were risk factors for PFS, and advanced lung cancer inflammation index (ALI)>171.15 was protective factor for PFS (HR=0.545, 95%CI: 0.344-0.863, P=0.010). IL-6>9.9 ng/L(HR=6.124, 95%CI: 1.950-19.228, P<0.002), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)>190.7 U/L (HR=2.776, 95%CI: 1.020-7.556, P=0.046), SII>2 003.95 (HR=4.521, 95%CI: 2.241-9.120, P<0.001) were risk factors for OS, and ALI>171.15 was a protective factor for OS (HR=0.434, 95%CI: 0.243-0.778, P=0.005). Conclusion: Baseline high levels of IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-8, SII, LDH, and low levels of ALI are risk factors for poor prognosis in patients with advanced NSCLC-COPD receiving immunotherapy.
AB  - 目的： 探讨外周血炎症指标对晚期非小细胞肺癌合并慢性阻塞性肺疾病（NSCLC-COPD）患者免疫治疗疗效的影响。 方法： 回顾性分析2019年1月至2021年8月在陆军军医大学新桥医院接受至少2次免疫治疗的178例Ⅲ、Ⅳ期NSCLC-COPD患者资料，收集治疗前2周内白细胞介素6（IL-6）、IL-8、肿瘤坏死因子alpha（TNF-alpha）等基线血液检测指标。随访截至2022年2月7日。应用X-tile软件确定外周血炎症指标的cut-off值，采用多因素Cox回归模型分析无进展生存时间（PFS）和总生存时间（OS）的影响因素。 结果： 178例患者中，男174例（97.8%），女4例（2.2%）；年龄42~86（64.3±8.3）岁；免疫单药治疗30例（16.9%），免疫联合化疗治疗114例（64.0%），免疫联合抗血管治疗21例（11.8%），免疫联合放疗13例（7.3%）。中位随访时间为14.5个月（95%CI：13.6~15.3个月）。客观缓解率（ORR）为44.9%（80/178），疾病控制率（DCR）为90.4%（161/178），中位PFS为14.6个月（95%CI：11.6~17.6个月），中位OS为25.7个月（95%CI：18.0~33.4个月）。多因素Cox风险模型分析结果显示，IL-6>9.9 ng/L（HR=5.885，95%CI：2.558~13.543，P<0.01）、TNF-alpha>8.8 ng/L（HR=3.213，95%CI：1.468~7.032，P=0.003）、IL-8>202 ng/L（HR=2.614，95%CI：1.054~6.482，P=0.038）、全身免疫炎症指数（SII）>2 003.95（HR=2.976，95%CI：1.647~5.379，P<0.001）是PFS的危险因素，晚期肺癌炎症指数（ALI）>171.15是PFS的保护因素（HR=0.545，95%CI：0.344~0.863，P=0.010）；IL-6>9.9 ng/L（HR=6.124，95%CI：1.950~19.228，P<0.002）、乳酸脱氢酶（LDH）>190.7 U/L（HR=2.776，95%CI：1.020~7.556，P=0.046）、SII>2 003.95（HR=4.521，95%CI：2.241~9.120，P<0.001）是OS的危险因素，ALI>171.15是OS的保护因素（HR=0.434，95%CI：0.243~0.778，P=0.005）。 结论： 基线高水平IL-6、TNF-alpha、IL-8、SII、LDH和低水平ALI是接受免疫治疗晚期NSCLC-COPD患者预后不良的危险因素。.

TI  - A real-world study of pneumonitis in non-small cell lung cancer patients receiving durvalumab following concurrent chemoradiation
T2  - JOURNAL OF THORACIC DISEASE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC) treated with the programmed death-ligand 1 inhibitor durvalumab has been associated with significant rates of pneumonitis, which has led to higher rates of discontinuation of therapy in real-world populations. Thus far there has been no consensus in the literature on the impact of pneumonitis on survival. Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study of veterans receiving durvalumab between 12/5/2017 and 4/15/2020. Participants were identified using VINCI data services. Patients were followed through 9/14/2021. Development of clinical pneumonitis was assessed through review of documentation and graded using CTCAE 4.0 criteria. Univariate logistic regression analysis evaluated for associations between body mass index (BMI), age, race, co-morbidity index, chemotherapy regimen, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) severity, and development of clinical pneumonitis. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier methods. Cox proportional hazards models were utilized to evaluate the association between risk of death at 1 and 2 years and candidate predictor variables.Results: A total of 284 patients were included in this study. Sixty-one patients developed clinically significant pneumonitis, 7 patients developed grade 5 pneumonitis (death from pneumonitis). The median OS in patients that developed pneumonitis was 27.8 vs. 36.9 months in patients that did not develop pneumonitis (P=0.22). BMI was found to be a clinical predictor of pneumonitis (P=0.04). COPD severity, race, age at durvalumab start date, chemotherapy regimen, and Romano comorbidity index were not significant predictors of pneumonitis. Cox proportional hazards analysis failed to demonstrate an association between the development of pneumonitis and risk of death in this population.Conclusions: The incidence of clinically significant pneumonitis is higher than noted in the PACIFIC trial in this cohort, however this high rate of pneumonitis does not have an impact on OS or PFS. Obesity was found to be a significant predictor of pneumonitis in this patient population.

TI  - Sequential or concomitant chemotherapy with hypofractionated radiotherapy for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer: a meta-analysis of randomized trials
T2  - JOURNAL OF THORACIC DISEASE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: For patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the standard treatment is concurrent or sequential chemotherapy with radiotherapy. Most treatment schedules use radiotherapy with conventional fractionation; however, the application of hypofractionated radiotherapy (HYPO-RT) regimens is rising. A meta-analysis was performed to assess the efficacy and safety of chemotherapy combined with HYPO-RT and indirectly compare with the outcomes from previous studies employing concomitant conventional radiotherapy (CONV-RT). Methods: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were identified on the electronic database sources through June 2020. Following the PRISMA guidelines, a meta-analysis was performed to assess if there were significant differences in the overall mortality (OM), local failure (LF), and disease progression (DP), comparing HYPO-RT-C vs. sequential chemotherapy followed HYPO-RT (HYPO-RT-S). To establish an indirect comparison with the current standard treatment, we calculate the risk ratio (RR) of the OM from RCTs using conventional chemoradiation, concurrent (CONV-RT-C), and sequential (CONV-RT-S), and compared with HYPO-RT. A P-value <0.05 was considered significant. Results: Two RCTs with a total of 288 patients were included. The RR for the OM, DP and LF at 3 year comparing HYPO-RT-C vs. HYPO-RT-S were 1.09 (95% CI: 0.96-1.28, P=0.17), 1.06 (95% CI: 0.82-1.23, P=0.610), and 1.06 (95% CI: 0.86-1.29, P=0.490), respectively. The late grade 3 pneumonitis and esophagitis had no significant difference between HYPO-RT groups. In the indirect comparison of RCTs using CONV-RT, the RR for the OM at 3 years was 1.03 (95% CI: 0.96-1.10, P=0.36) with no significant difference for the HYPO-RT arms 1.09 (95% CI: 0.96-1.28, P=0.17). Discussion: HYPO-RT given with chemotherapy provides satisfactory OM, LF, and DP in locally advanced NSCLC with similar rates to the CONV-RT. These findings support HYPO-RT inclusion in future clinical trials as an experimental arm in addition to the incorporation of new strategies, such as immunotherapy.

AB  - Project Summary/AbstractCarcinoma of the pancreas, or pancreatic cancer (PC), is the third leading cause of cancer-related death inthe US. Despite recent advances in the current treatments that include surgery, radiation therapy, chemo-and immunotherapy, the 5-year survival rate is as low as 9%. The long-term goal of this project is todevelop a first-in-class, efficient and well tolerable therapy for PC to be used standalone or with standardchemo- and/or immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) treatments as induction and/or maintenance therapy. In PC patients, overexpression of TREM-1 correlates with poor survival, implicating TREM-1 as a newtarget. Current TREM-1 blockers all attempt to block binding of uncertain ligand(s) to TREM-1. To reducerisk of failure in the clinic, we developed a ligand-independent TREM-1 inhibitory peptide GF9 that can beformulated into macrophage-specific lipopeptide complexes (LPC) to improve its half-life and targeting. In Phase I, we showed that: 1) In suppressing tumor growth and improving survival, TREM-1 blockadeusing GF9-LPC in PC xenografts is as effective as a standard chemo: gemcitabine (GEM)+nab-paclitaxel(PTX) combo, and 2) addition of GF9-LPC to GEM+nab-PTX sensitizes the tumor to chemo and triplessurvival rate of mice. Mechanistically, in PC xenografts, GF9-LPC reduces tumor-associated macrophage(TAM) infiltration and serum level of CSF1. As shown by others, in mice with hepatocellular carcinoma,blocking TREM-1+ TAMs by GF9 reverses immunosuppression and overcomes anti-PDL1 resistance. The goal of this project is to further develop GF9 therapy for PC to be used as an induction/maintenancetherapy alone or with first-line standard chemo treatments (GEM+nab-PTX) and/or ICB (anti-PD1/PDL1). Phase II aims are to: 1) generate and test rationally designed manufacturing friendly GF9 sequence-based formulations with favorable pharmacokinetic profile and high efficacy in vivo and select the lead(sub-aim – develop an assay to analyze GF9 in blood in PK studies), 2) test the lead in combination withGEM+nab-PTX in xenograft and syngeneic mouse models of PC, 3) test the lead in combination with anti-PD1/PDL1 in syngeneic mouse models of PC, and 4) test the lead in the non-clinical toxicology studies.Histology/IHC studies will be performed to analyze intratumoral macrophage infiltration as well asangiogenesis, tumor cell proliferation and death. Cytokines including CSF-1 will be analyzed. Follow-up Phase IIb will include other administration and combination (eg, radiation+GF9; anti-CSF-1R+GF9) regimen, TOX, ADME, CMC and other IND-enabling studies. Final manufacturing friendly product willrepresent safe and stable PC therapy. Its anticipated safety is supported by good tolerability of SignaBlok'sGF9 sequence-based formulations by long term-treated healthy, cancer and arthritic mice. Prototypes ofSignaBlok's LPC were safe and well tolerated in clinical trials. TREM-1 blockade using peptide LR12 bySignaBlok's top competitor (Inotrem, France) was safe and well tolerated in healthy and septic subjects.

TI  - Characteristics of toxicity occurrence patterns in concurrent chemoradiotherapy after induction chemotherapy for patients with locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer: a pooled analysis based on individual patient data of CALGB/Alliance trials
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Background: For patients with locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), concurrent chemoradiotherapy is the foundational treatment strategy. Adding induction chemotherapy did not achieve a superior efficacy but increased the burden from toxicity. Accordingly, we retrospectively investigated the toxicity patterns through pooling individual patient data of the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB)/ Alliance trials.Methods: We included a total of 637 patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC who received induction chemotherapy with a platinum doublet and concurrent chemoradiotherapy and experienced at least one adverse event (AE) in CALGB 9130, 9431, 9534, 30105, 30106 and 39801 trials. The following toxicity occurrence patterns were evaluated: top 10 most frequent AEs, AE distribution by grade, rate of treatment discontinuation due to AEs, associations of AE occurrence with patient characteristics and treatment phase, the time to the first grade >_3 AE occurrence and its associations with patient characteristics and treatment phase.Results: The occurrence of AEs was the main reason accounting for treatment discontinuation (60 of 637 among all patients; 18 of 112 patients who experienced the induction phase only; 42 of 525 patients who experienced both phases). All patients experienced a total of 11,786 AEs (grade >_3: 1,049 of 5,538 in induction phase, 1,382 of 6,248 in concurrent phase). Lymphocytes and white blood count were of top 3 grade >_3 AEs that patients experienced the most in the either phase. Multivariable analysis found AE occurrence was associated with age >_65 {any grade: odds ratio (OR) =1.44 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.12-1.86]} and the concurrent phase [grade >_3: OR =1.86 (95% CI: 1.41-2.47); any grade: OR =1.47 (95% CI: 1.19-1.81)]. Patients in the concurrent phase were more likely and earlier to develop grade >_3 AEs than those in the induction phase [hazard ratio (HR) =4.37 (95% CI: 2.52-7.59)].Conclusions: The report provides a better understanding regarding the toxicity occurrence patterns in concurrent chemoradiotherapy after induction chemotherapy.

TI  - A postoperative tumor-specific death prediction model for patients with endometrial cancer: a retrospective study
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Endometrial cancer (EC) is an epithelial malignancy occurring in the endometrium, with a 5-year mortality rate of above 10%. However, there is currently a lack of studies exploring the potential of a predictive model of tumor-specific death after surgery in these patients. Methods: From January 2015 to December 2017, data related to 482 patients with EC admitted to the Dushu Lake Hospital Affiliated to Soochow University were analyzed. Patients were divided into death (n=62) and survival (n=420) groups according to whether tumor-specific death occurred at 5 years postoperatively or not. The clinical characteristics of the two groups were compared, and the risk factors for tumorspecific death in patients with EC 5 years after surgery were investigated by logistics regression analysis. A nomogram prediction model was established according to the relevant risk factors. Results: Tumor size, Ki-67 positive rate, Federation International of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage, and the rate of vascular tumor thrombus between the two groups (P<0.05) were found to be the statistically significant factors. Positive Ki-67, tumor size >3.35 cm, stage III, and vascular tumor thrombus were factors that influenced the tumor-specific death at 5 years after surgery (P<0.05). The predictive model obtained an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves in the training and verification sets of 0.847 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.779-0.916] and 0.886 (95% CI: 0.803-0.969), respectively. Conclusions: The nomogram prediction model, which was established in this study, was proved to be valuable in predicting tumor-specific death 5 years after the surgery in patients with EC.

TI  - Treatment strategies based on different oligoprogressive patterns after immunotherapy failure in metastatic NSCLC
T2  - THERAPEUTIC ADVANCES IN MEDICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background:Oligoprogressive disease is recognized as the overall umbrella term; however, a small number of progressions on imaging can represent different clinical scenarios. This study aims to explore the optimal treatment strategy after immunotherapy (IO) resistance in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), especially in personalized therapies for patients with different oligoprogressive patterns. Methods:Based on European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer consensus, metastatic NSCLC patients with cancer progression after IO resistance were divided into four patterns, repeat oligoprogression (REO, oligoprogression with a history of oligometastatic disease), induced oligoprogression (INO, oligoprogression with a history of polymetastatic disease), de-novo polyprogression (DNP, polyprogression with a history of oligometastatic disease), and repeat polyprogression (REP, polyprogression with a history of polymetastatic disease). Patients with advanced NSCLC who received programmed cell death-1/programmed cell death ligand-1 inhibitors between January 2016 and July 2021 at Shanghai Chest Hospital were identified. The progression patterns and next-line progression-free survival (nPFS), overall survival (OS) were investigated stratified by treatment strategies. nPFS and OS were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results:A total of 500 metastatic NSCLC patients were included. Among 401 patients developed progression, 36.2% (145/401) developed oligoprogression and 63.8% (256/401) developed polyprogression. Specifically, 26.9% (108/401) patients had REO, 9.2% (37/401) patients had INO, 27.4% (110/401) patients had DNP, and 36.4% (146/401) patients had REP, respectively. The patients with REO who received local ablative therapy (LAT) had significant longer median nPFS and OS compared with no LAT group (6.8 versus 3.3 months; p = 0.0135; OS, not reached versus 24.5 months; p = 0.0337). By contrast, there were no nPFS and OS differences in INO patients who received LAT compared with no LAT group (nPFS, 3.6 versus 5.3 months; p = 0.3540; OS, 36.6 versus 45.4 months; p = 0.8659). But in INO patients, there were significant longer median nPFS and OS using IO maintenance by contrast with IO halt treatment (nPFS, 6.1 versus 4.1 months; p = 0.0264; OS, 45.4 versus 32.3 months; p = 0.0348). Conclusions:LAT (radiation or surgery) is more important for patients with REO while IO maintenance plays a more dominant role in patients with INO.

TI  - Outcomes of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer and airway obstruction treated with photodynamic therapy and non-photodynamic therapy ablation modalities
T2  - JOURNAL OF THORACIC DISEASE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with central airway obstruction (CAO) may have better survival on systemic therapy if the airway patency is successfully restored by bronchoscopic interventions. It remains unclear which therapeutic bronchoscopic modality [laser, stenting, external beam radiation, brachytherapy and photodynamic therapy (PDT)] used for restoring airway patency positively affects outcomes in these patients. We analyzed the effectiveness of PDT in terms of mortality, and time to subsequent treatments in patients with stage III and IV NSCLC.Methods: Study used Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Medicare linked data. We categorized NSCLC patients diagnosed between 2000 and 2011 and with stage III and IV, into three treatment groups: PDT + radiation +/- chemotherapy, non-PDT ablation therapy + radiation +/- chemotherapy, and radiation + chemotherapy. We analyzed all-cause and cause-specific mortality using Cox proportional hazard models with an inverse probability weighted propensity score adjustment. Time to subsequent treatment was analyzed using GLM model.Results: For the PDT group, hazard for all-cause and cause-specific mortality was comparable to the radiation + chemotherapy group (HR =1.03, 95% CI: 0.73-1.45; and HR =1.04, 95% CI: 0.71-1.51, respectively). The non-PDT ablation group had higher hazard for all-cause (HR =1.22, 95% CI: 1.13-1.33) and cause-specific mortality (HR =1.10, 95% CI: 1.01-1.20), compared to the radiation + chemotherapy group. The PDT group had longer time to follow-up treatment, compared to non-PDT ablation group.Conclusions: In our exploratory study of stage III and IV NSCLC patients with CAO, addition of PDT demonstrated hazard of mortality comparable to radiation + chemotherapy group. However, addition of non-PDT ablation showed higher mortality compared to the radiation + chemotherapy group. Future studies should investigate the efficacy and effectiveness of multimodal therapy including radiation, chemo, immunotherapy and bronchoscopic interventions.

AB  - During the last 15 years, various antibodies specific for antigens associated with determined types of cancer have been used therapeutically, including some in unlabeled forms as immune effectors. The results of clinical studies have been unpromising for patients with colorectal cancer at the advanced metastatic stage but much more favorable in terms of increased survival for the adjuvant situations of residual microscopic disease. Antibodies have also been used as carriers for cytotoxic substances, but with rather disappointing clinical results when they were labeled with toxins or antimitotic agents. The results have been variable for labeling with radionuclides (mainly iodine-131), sometimes proving quite favorable for refractory forms of non-hodgkin's lymphomas or acute leukemias. In this last indication, radioimmunotherapy has been associated with chemotherapy to enhance action before a bone-marrow graft. However, the clinical results have been disappointing in the treatment of solid tumors, showing responses only in the case of small targets. In the future, treatment with antibodies will focus on microscopic tumors, in association with other therapeutic modalities especially, chemotherapy and biotherapy.

AB  - Introduction: About 10% of patients with locally advanced NSCLC (LA-NSCLC) harbor EGFR mutation and recent reports suggested the declined benefit with an immune checkpoint inhibitor in this population. The attempt that introduces EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor into the treatment of LA-NSCLC with EGFR mutation has been warranted.Methods: Chemotherapy-naive patients with unresectable LA-NSCLC with sensitive EGFR mutation (exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R point mutation) were enrolled. Patients were treated with gefitinib (250 mg/d for 2 y) plus concurrent thoracic radiotherapy (64 Gy/32 fractions). The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) at 2 years (trial identifier, UMIN000008366).Results: Between August 2012 and November 2017, a total of 28 patients were enrolled and 27 were eligible. The median age was 67 years (range: 45-74); never/current or former smoker in 15/12 patients, respectively; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0/1 in 19/8; EGFR exon 19 deletion/exon 21 L858R in 13/14; and c-stage IIIA/IIIB in 14/13. The PFS rate at 2 years by independent review was 29.6% (one-sided 95% confidence interval [CI]: 17.6%-). The overall response rate was 81.5% (95% CI: 63.3%91.3%), median PFS was 18.6 months (95% CI: 12.0-24.5 mo), and median overall survival was 61.1 months (95% CI: 38.1 mo-not reached). Approximately half of the patients exhibited solitary brain metastasis as their first site of relapse. Adverse events greater than or equal to grade 3 were fatigue, skin reaction, and appetite loss (3.7% each).Conclusions: This prospective study revealed the tolerability and the possible efficacy of gefitinib plus concurrent thoracic radiotherapy in patients with LA-NSCLC having EGFR mutation.

TI  - Adjuvant chemotherapy for completely resected IIA-IIIA non-small cell lung cancer: compliance to guidelines, safety and efficacy in real-life practice
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL LUNG CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Since randomised clinical trials demonstrated a survival benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) following curative-intent lung surgery, AC has been implemented as a standard therapeutic strategy for patients with a completely resected IIA-IIIA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Regarding the moderate benefit of AC and the lack of literature on AC use in real-life practice, we aimed to evaluate compliance to guidelines, AC safety and efficacy in a less selected population. Methods: Between January 2009 and December 2014, we retrospectively analysed 210 patients with theoretical indication of AC following curative-intent lung surgery for a completely resected IIA-IIIA NSCLC. The primary objective of this retrospective study was to evaluate compliance to AC guidelines. Secondary objectives included safety and efficacy of AC in real-life practice. Results: Among 210 patients with a theoretical indication of AC, chemotherapy administration was validated in multidisciplinary team (MDT) for 62.4% of them and 117 patients (55.7%) finally received AC. Patient's clinical conditions were the main reasons advanced in MDT for no respect to AC guidelines. Most of the patients received cisplatin-vinorelbine (86.3%) and AC was initiated within 8 weeks following lung surgery for 73.5% of patients. One-half of patients who received AC experienced side effects leading to either dose-intensity modification or treatment interruption. In real-life practice, AC was found to provide a survival benefit over surgery alone. Factors related to daily-life practice such as delayed AC initiation or incomplete AC planned dose received were not associated with an inferior survival. Conclusions: Although AC use might differ from guidelines in real-life practice, this retrospective study highlights that AC can be used safely and remains efficient among a less selected population. In the context of immunotherapy and targeted therapies development in peri-operative treatment strategies, the place of AC has to be precised in the future.

TI  - A Meta-analysis of adoptive immunotherapy combined with chemo /radio therapy in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer
T2  - Chinese Journal of Cancer Biotherapy
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To systematically assess the therapeutic effectiveness of adoptive immunotherapy combined with chemo /radio therapy compared with chemo /radio therapy alone in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Methods: A systematic search of Pubmed,Medline,EMBASE,Cochrane Library,CNKI and VIP database from January 1995 to September 2012 was performed to identify the eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized concurrent controlled trails (NRCCTs). The improper documents were excluded. The soft-ware Revman5. 0 was used for data synthesis. Results: A total of 10 studies involving 1 326 patients were identified. The result of Meta-analyses showed that adoptive immunotherapy combined with radio /chemo therapy improved the 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) (OR = 2. 20,95%CI: 1. 44 - 3. 36,P = 0. 0003) and 2-year overall survival (OR = 2. 69,95% CI: 1. 92 - 3. 78,P < 0. 00001). Both early-stage and advanced NSCLC patients benefited from adoptive immunotherapy (OR = 3. 24[1. 65 - 6. 35]; OR = 2. 86[1. 37 - 5. 98]). The adverse events were self limiting,including fever,chill,nausea,and fatigue. No severe toxicity was observed. Conclusion: Adoptive immunotherapy combined with chemo /radio therapy can decrease the risk of recurrence and improve the overall survival of NSCLC patients; early-stage patients receiving adoptive immunotherapy may benefit more.

AB  - Extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTCL) is a relatively rare group of highly aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). The disease has rapid clinical progress, high degree of malignancy and poor prognosis. Traditional chemoradiotherapy regimens have not shown good efficacy. In recent years, the immunotherapy of tumors has developed rapidly. At present, it has shown strong therapeutic activity in the treatment of various solid tumors such as non-small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer, melanoma and kidney cancer. Multiple tumor immunotherapy drugs have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for clinical use. This article reviews recent novel immunotherapeutic regimens of ENKTCL, hoping to change the treatment modality of this malignant disease.
AB  - 结外NK/T细胞淋巴瘤（ENKTCL）是一组比较少见的高度侵袭性的非霍奇金淋巴瘤。该病临床进展迅速、恶性程度高、预后较差，传统的放化疗方案并没有显示出良好的疗效。近几年来，肿瘤的免疫治疗迅猛发展，目前已在多种实体肿瘤如非小细胞肺癌、前列腺癌、黑色素瘤、肾癌的治疗中展示出了强大的治疗活性，多个肿瘤免疫治疗药物已经获得美国食品药品监督管理局批准上市并应用于临床。本文综述了近年来ENKTCL的新型免疫治疗方案，希望能够改变这种恶性疾病的治疗模式。.

AB  - Traditional treatments against advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with high morbidity and mortality continue to be dissatisfactory. Given this situation, there is an urgent requirement for alternative modalities that provide lower invasiveness, superior clinical effectiveness, and minimal adverse effects. The combination of photodynamic therapy (PDT) and immunotherapy gradually become a promising approach for high-grade malignant NSCLC. Nevertheless, owing to the absence of precise drug delivery techniques as well as the hypoxic and immunosuppressive characteristics of the tumor microenvironment (TME), the efficacy of this combination therapy approach is less than ideal. In this study, we construct a novel nanoplatform that indocyanine green (ICG), a photosensitizer, loads into hollow manganese dioxide (MnO2) nanospheres (NPs) (ICG@MnO2), and then encapsulated in PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies (anti-PD-L1) reprogrammed exosomes (named ICG@MnO2@Exo-anti-PD-L1), to effectively modulate the TME to oppose NSCLC by the synergy of PDT and immunotherapy modalities. The ICG@MnO2@Exo-anti-PD-L1 NPs are precisely delivered to the tumor sites by targeting specially PD-L1 highly expressed cancer cells to controllably release anti-PD-L1 in the acidic TME, thereby activating T cell response. Subsequently, upon endocytic uptake by cancer cells, MnO2 catalyzes the conversion of H2O2 to O2, thereby alleviating tumor hypoxia. Meanwhile, ICG further utilizes O2 to produce singlet oxygen (1O2) to kill tumor cells under 808 nm near-infrared (NIR) irradiation. Furthermore, a high level of intratumoral H2O2 reduces MnO2 to Mn2+, which remodels the immune microenvironment by polarizing macrophages from M2 to M1, further driving T cells. Taken together, the current study suggests that the ICG@MnO2@Exo-anti-PDL1 NPs could act as a novel drug delivery platform for achieving multimodal therapy in treating NSCLC.

AB  - Our laboratory has previously identified the embryonic transcription factor transcription as a tumor antigen and a driver of cancer plasticity and tumor resistance to various therapeutics. Brachyury is expressed in various types of cancer, including lung cancer, triple negative breast cancer, small cell lung carcinomas, germ cell tumors, and the rare tumor type chordoma, while being almost undetectable in the majority of adult normal tissues. A phase I clinical study of a modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) priming followed by a fowlpox virus boosting, each encoding for brachyury and three costimulatory molecules has been completed in patients with advanced solid tumors. The vaccine was well-tolerated and induced immune responses to brachyury and the "cascade antigens" carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and mucin-1 (MUC1) in the majority of patients, with some evidence of clinical benefit. A phase I clinical trial of a multi-targeted recombinant adenovirus 5-based vaccine targeting brachyury, CEA and MUC1 was also completed, demonstrating the generation of CD4+ and/or CD8+ T-cell responses against all three antigens in the majority of patients, without any evidence of antigenic competition or toxicity. Similarly, an adenovirus vaccine platform using adenovirus 5 vectors targeting prostate-specific antigen (PSA), brachyury, and MUC1 was evaluated in patients with metastatic castration prostate cancer (mCRPC). The vaccine was tolerable and safe, elicited multifunctional T-cell responses to all three antigens, and showed evidence of clinical activity. The study of brachyury as a tumor antigen and its role as a driver of cancer plasticity led us to investigate and demonstrate a link between the acquisition of mesenchymal features by carcinoma cells and mechanisms of resistance to lysis by immune effector cells. Following these observations, we investigated approaches to improve tumor susceptibility to immune attack via modulation of tumor phenotype. We previously showed that one of the drivers of tumor EMT is the chemokine IL-8 which also promotes the recruitment of immunosuppressive cells to the tumor site, particularly the migration of granulocytic myeloid suppressor cells (G-MDSCs). One of the tumor types with a high degree of infiltration with G-MDSCs is head and neck carcinoma (HNSCC), also characterized by high expression of IL-8. In collaboration with Dr. C. Allen (NIDCD), the benefit of blocking IL-8 signaling in HNSCC models via inhibition of the IL-8 receptors, CXCR1 and CXCR2, was shown in combination with NK-cell mediated immunotherapy. In addition to IL-8, transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) is a master regulator of tumor plasticity. We recently showed that the combined use of a CXCR1/2 inhibitor with a bifunctional agent that simultaneously blocks PD-L1 and 'traps' soluble TGF-beta at the site of the tumor, termed bintrafusp alfa, results in more effective anti-tumor control, compared to each monotherapy. We showed that simultaneous inhibition of CXCR1/2, TGF-beta, and PD-L1 signaling synergizes to reduce mesenchymal tumor features in murine models of breast and lung cancer, and to markedly enhance the expression of tumor epithelial markers while reducing infiltration with suppressive G-MDSCs, enhancing tumor infiltration and activation of T-cells, and leading to improved anti-tumor activity. The addition of vaccine to the combination of bintrafusp alfa and CXCR1/2 inhibition was subsequently shown to induce greater tumor infiltration with T cells highly positive for markers of proliferation and cytotoxicity, and to restructure the tumor microenvironment with reduced Tregs and CD11b+Ly6G+ myeloid cells. Altogether, these results provide the rationale for the use of strategies that simultaneously block IL-8 signaling, neutralize TGF-beta in the tumor microenvironment, inhibit PD-L1, and activate tumor-specific immunity via the use of cancer vaccines.

AB  - PROJECT SUMMARYThe inability of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) to target and kill tumor cells is a major hurdle in treatingmany malignancies. New treatment strategies that block immune inhibitory mechanisms, such as antibodiesthat block the interaction of programmed death-1 (PD-1) with its ligand, B7 homolog 1 (B7-H1, also known asPD-L1), have shown promising efficacy in the clinic. Termed checkpoint inhibitor therapy, these drugs havebeen approved for many indications, including melanoma, Hodgkin lymphoma and lung cancer, and areincreasingly being used in combination or in conjunction with other cancer therapies, such as chemotherapyand radiation. Although checkpoint inhibitor treatments have resulted in durable clinical responses in a largeproportion of cases, many patients present with tumor types that do not respond to treatment. For instance,~26% of NSCLC cases, which are negative for B7-H1/PD-L1 and positive for TILs, have been shown to beresistant to anti-PD-1/B7-H1(PD-L1) (anti-PD) therapy. This type of NSCLC, denoted as Type III, is suspectedto harbor a mechanism of immune inhibition distinct from other NSCLC types, which has been found to bedriven, at least in part, by sialic acid binding immunoglobulin-like lectin 15 (siglec-15). Siglec-15 expression ismutually exclusive from B7-H1/PD-L1 expression in NSCLC cohorts and has been shown to inhibit T cellproliferation and effector function. Blocking of siglec-15 using anti-siglec-15 (S15) monoclonal antibody (mAb)is therapeutic in mouse models and human cell culture systems and results in amplified T cell responses.Based on these findings, a phase I/II, dose escalation, safety and tolerability clinical trial for S15 mAbtreatment in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors is on-going. Although preliminary studies havegenerated promising results with regard to the potential efficacy of S15 mAb in the clinic, the mechanism ofS15-mediated immune suppression remains unknown. Furthermore, to enhance and improve treatmentresponse rates, more work must be done to identify pertinent biomarkers for S15 mAb therapy and modes thatmodulate S15 expression. Finally, developing combination strategies that alter the tumor microenvironment(TME), such that conversion of the tumor Type is achieved, is imperative for successful targeting and killing oftumor by immune cells and in attaining increased patient response rates to available checkpoint inhibitortherapies. A newly generated immune PDX (iPDX) mouse model, which uses patient-derived tumor tissue torecapitulate and manipulate immune cell responses in the TME, will be utilized to investigate these topicsspecifically in the NSCLC setting. A proposed investigator-initiated phase II clinical trial in patients with S15+advanced NSCLC who have progressed on PD-1 axis inhibitor therapy will evaluate S15 mAb efficacy andsupport biomarker validation studies. Strategies to combine S15 mAb with other agents, such as anti-FGL1and anti-4-1BB/CD137, to improve therapeutic effect will also be explored. Taken together, the studiesproposed here will improve our understanding of the NSCLC TME and enhance therapeutic approaches.

TI  - The impact of previous therapy strategy on the efficiency of anlotinib hydrochloride as a third-line treatment on patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC): a subgroup analysis of ALTER0303 trial
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL LUNG CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Lung cancer remains one of the deadliest cancers worldwide. The ALTER0303 trial revealed that anlotinib might be used as a third-line or further treatment in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Meanwhile, the impact of previous therapy strategies on the efficiency of anlotinib still remains unknown.Methods: The subgroup of patients in ALTER0303 were analyzed by using Kaplan-Meier estimates, Pearson chi(2), or Fisher's exact test.Results: There was no statistical significance on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) among patients in different previous antiangiogenic treatments groups. Patients in the chest radiotherapy (CRT) group had longer median PFS than the non-CRT group (5.93 vs. 4.63 m, P=0.027). Regardless of what kind of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR TKI) and chemotherapy regimens were used previously, all patients gained longer PFS in the anlotinib group, while only patients treated with vinorelbine/platinum in the EGFR wild type group, pemetrexed/platinum, vinorelbine/platinum, and gefitinib in the EGFR mutation group, and EGFR TKI used as the first line group could benefit from anlotinib on OS. When the OS was calculated from the time of diagnosis to the death, anlotinib could have increased median OS about 6 months (33.8 vs. 27.8 m, P<0.001) compared to the placebo with a hazard ratio (HR) (95% CI): 0.77 (0.60, 1.00).Conclusions: This study indicated that previous bevacizumab or endostatin treatments had no impact on the efficiency of anlotinib. Patients with CRT history benefited more from anlotinib on PFS. EGFR TKI and chemotherapy treatment history had more impact on OS than PFS in patients treated with anlotinib compared to placebo.

TI  - Immunotherapy With Radiotherapy for Brain Metastases in Patients With NSCLC: NEJ060
T2  - JTO CLINICAL AND RESEARCH REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) -based treatment has become standard treatment for patients with advanced NSCLC. We aimed to determine the survival bene fit of upfront radiotherapy for brain metastases (BMs) in patients with NSCLC who received ICI alone (ICI-alone) or with chemotherapy (ICI-chemo). Methods: This study included consecutive patients with NSCLC having BMs who received ICI alone or ICI-chemo at 50 institutes between February 2017 and September 2021. The presence of BMs was con firmed by imaging before treatment. Treatment outcomes were compared between patients who did and did not receive upfront radiotherapy for BMs. Potential confounding factors were adjusted between the groups through inverse probability treatment weighting (IPTW) analysis and overlap weighting (OW) analysis with propensity scores. Results: Patients were grouped as ICI-alone cohort, 224 patients (upfront-radiotherapy group, 135 patients; noradiotherapy group, 89 patients) and ICI-chemo cohort, 367 patients (upfront-radiotherapy group, 212 patients; noradiotherapy group, 155 patients). In the ICI-alone cohort, the overall survival of the upfront -radiotherapy group was significantly longer than that of the no -radiotherapy group (IPTW-adjusted hazards ratio [HR] = 0.45 [95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.29-0.72], OW -adjusted HR = 0.52 [95% CI: 0.35-0.77]). In contrast, in the ICI-chemo cohort, the OS of the upfront -radiotherapy group was not significantly different from that of the no -radiotherapy group (IPTWadjusted HR = 1.02 [95% CI: 0.70-1.48], OW -adjusted HR = 0.93 [95% CI: 0.65-1.33]). Conclusions: Upfront radiotherapy for BMs was associated with longer overall survival in patients with NSCLC who received ICI alone; however, it did not exhibit survival benefits in the patients who received ICI-chemo.

AB  - Circulating Tumor Cells Analyses and Molecular Profiling for Patients ReceivingRadiation TherapyABSTRACTWe propose to develop a circulating tumor cell (CTC) assay with unique features and efficacysuperior to currently available CTC assays. CTC assays have attracted intense recent attentionbecause of the potential to serially interrogate the biology of solid tumors with minimal risk. Theresulting information obtained, including genetic information predicting response to targetedtherapy, may inform the clinical management of patients receiving radiation therapy (RT), thus“personalizing treatment” in ways previously unachievable. We propose to study non-small celllung cancer (NSCLC) and melanoma, two solid tumors of strategic importance and for which wehave protocols rapidly accruing patients. These disease sites represent high priority for RTtreatment in our investigational clinical trials and represent examples of respectively, epithelialand non-epithelial tumors. We have achieved preliminary data that suggests our approachsuccessfully detects CTCs in patients for whom the current FDA-approved CTC assay isineffective. Key questions regarding CTC analyses remain, the answers to which would informhow best to incorporate these assays into standard radiation oncology practice. Thesequestions include: (1) Can CTCs be detected in a range of solid tumors undergoing radiationtherapy (RT) or other forms of treatment? (2) Do CTC counts give lead-time notice of diseaserecurrence or progression? (3) Can the genetic background of the identified CTCs beelucidated and does it change over time and after treatment? We will employ a CTC detectionmethod that relies on the elevated telomerase activity in almost all tumors, a hallmark of cancer,which is impervious to limitations posed by the lack of surface expression of tumor markers. InSpecific Aim 1 we will track CTC counts in patients with a range of presentations of localizedNSCLC undergoing RT to test whether CTC analysis can give lead time notice of tumorrecurrence. Aim 2 will test whether CTC analysis is effective in melanoma patients undergoingtreatment, including radiation and immunotherapy. For Aim 3, we will test whether the geneticprofile of CTCs changes after treatment, including DNA mutations that predict for response tobiologically targeted agents. Our successful accomplishment of these scientific aims willilluminate the potential usefulness of CTC assays for a wide range of patients receiving RT andother anticancer treatment.

TI  - Response and resistance to SHP2 inhibitors alone and in combination in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - Despite recent advances in targeted and immune-therapies, there is an urgent need for new therapeuticapproaches for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). SH2 domain-containing phosphatase-2(SHP2), encoded by PTPN11, is a key “positive” signaling component, required for RAS/ERK MAP kinaseactivation by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and cytokine receptors, as well as by oncogenic amplified RTKsand protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK) fusion proteins. Recently, potent, orally available, highly specific SHP2inhibitors were developed. These agents inhibit amplified RTK/PTK-fusion-driven cells/tumors and are inPhase I clinical trials. Our results suggest that SHP2-inhibitors (SHP2-Is) could have a much broader role incancer therapy. SHP2-Is block adaptive resistance to MEK inhibitors (MEK-Is) in KRAS-mutant and -WT cells,acting upstream of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (SOS1/2). Consequently, SHP2-Is have single agentefficacy against “cycling” KRAS mutants (e.g., KRASG12C), which retain intrinsic GTPase activity. Supported byextensive Preliminary Data, we hypothesize that SHP2-Is will also enhance the efficacy of newly developedKRASG12C (G12C) inhibitors in G12C-mutant NSCLC, the effects of MEK-Is in Osimertinib (Osi)-resistantEGFR- mutant NSCLC, and the effects of Osi in Osi-sensitive EGFR-mutant NSCLC. SHP2 also binds immunecheckpoint receptors, including PD1, might inhibit immune receptor signaling, and has complex effects onmyeloid cells and other cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME). These pleiotropic actions position SHP2at the nexus of targeted and immune therapies. This MPI application joins experts in SHP2 action (NEEL) andNSCLC translational biology (WONG) to clarify the utility of SHP2-Is as NSCLC therapeutics. We will: (1) testcombinations of SHP2-Is with covalent RASG12C inhibitors, MEK-Is, and EGFR-inhibitors in KRAS- andEGFR-mutant NSCLC GEMMs; (2) clarify cell-autonomous and non-autonomous effects of these combinationsusing state-of-the art immune assays, drug-resistant tumor cells, immune cell depletion and new, inducibleSHP2-I-resistant GEMMs; and (3) analyze recurrent tumors and perform CRISPR/Cas9 screens to identify thelandscape of resistance to these agents.

TI  - Treatment Patterns for Patients With Unresected Stage III NSCLC: Analysis of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Database
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundRecently, immunotherapy (IO) has shown striking survival improvement in unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the role of chemo-radiotherapy (CRT) for improvement in outcomes should not be disregarded. This study aimed to compare the treatment patterns and illustrate the impact of radiotherapy on the cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS) of patients with unresected locally advanced stage III NSCLC. MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed the data of patients with stage III NSCLC patients who did not undergo surgery from the National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database between 2001 and 2016, and three continuous years were regarded as one unit. Using the Kaplan-Meier method, we identified the CSS and OS. Then, a linear regression model was graphed to analyze the correlation between median survival of CSS or OS and calendar years in the radiotherapy alone, chemotherapy alone, and CRT groups. ResultsA total of 20986 patients were included in this study. In the overall cohort, CSS and OS improved consistently. To explore the reason for the improved survival, patients were divided into three different cohorts: radiotherapy alone, chemotherapy alone, and CRT. From 2001 to 2015, the median CSS improved persistently, 7, 8, 8, 9, and 11 months in the radiotherapy alone group and 12, 13, 15, 17, 19 months in the CRT group, but improvement in outcomes was less consistent in the chemotherapy alone group (10, 9, 11, 12, 12 months). To better visualize the correlation between CSS and calendar year, linear regression was performed, yielding r(2) = 0.8032, P = 0.0395 for the radiotherapy alone group; r(2) = 0.7206, P = 0.0689 for the chemotherapy alone group; and r(2) = 0.9878, P = 0.0006 for the CRT group. Similar findings were observed in the OS data. In addition to this, we also analyzed different pathological types and also obtained the same results. ConclusionsThe survival of patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC has improved substantially, and the most pronounced and consistent improvements were observed in the CRT group. In addition to IO, radiotherapy played an essential role in the treatment of unresectable stage III NSCLC in the past years and should be considered in the design of clinical trials.

TI  - A Real-World Evaluation of Atezolizumab Plus Platinum-Etoposide Chemotherapy in Patients With Extensive-Stage SCLC in Canada
T2  - JTO CLINICAL AND RESEARCH REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The real-world data evaluating treatment outcomes of atezolizumab plus carboplatin-etoposide chemotherapy (atezolizumab) for extensive-stage SCLC (ESCLC) are lacking. Our objective was to evaluate real -world outcomes of ESCLC treated with atezolizumab.Methods: A retrospective analysis of provincial patients with ESCLC who started first-line (1L) systemic treatment was conducted. We primarily evaluated the progression -free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) outcomes in association with atezolizumab compared with platinum-etoposide chemotherapy (chemotherapy) while adjusting for relevant demographic and clinical factors. Adverse events (AEs) during 1L were evaluated.Results: A total of 67 patients were identified. Of the 34 patients who received atezolizumab, 24% had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status greater than or equal to 2, approximately 50% were more than or equal to 65 years, 21% received cisplatin-etoposide chemotherapy before atezolizumab, and 12% had thoracic radiation (tRT). Within the atezolizumab versus chemo-therapy group, the median PFS equals to 6.0 versus 4.3 months (p = 0.03) whereas OS = 12.8 versus 7.1 months (p = 0.01). Relative to chemotherapy, the hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) for PFS was 0.53 (0.28-1.02) and OS was 0.42 (0.20-0.88) with atezolizumab. tRT compared with no tRT receipt correlated with reduced death risk (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval] = 0.33 [0.13- 0.88]). AE-related treatment withdrawal with atezolizumab was 32% and 15% with chemotherapy (p = 0.02). Within the tRT subgroup, 25% versus 20% in atezolizumab versus chemotherapy group, respectively, discontinued 1L owing to AE. lConclusions: This is the first real-world study revealing comparable survival with that in the IMpower133 trial. Treatment discontinuation from AEs was higher with ate-zolizumab among Canadian patients with ESCLC. Our data suggest safe use of tRT and chemoimmunotherapy, but its efficacy for ESCLC warrants further study.(c) 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Cost Effectiveness of Durvalumab in Unresectable Stage III NSCLC: 4-Year Survival Update and Model Validation from a UK Healthcare Perspective
T2  - PHARMACOECONOMICS-OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Background In the phase III PACIFIC study, durvalumab improved survival versus placebo in patients with unresectable stage III non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose disease had not progressed after platinum-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy. The appraisal by the UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) included a cost-effectiveness analysis based on an early data readout from PACIFIC [March 2018 data cut-off (DCO); median follow- up duration 25.2 months; range 0.2-43.1]. Uncertainties regarding long-term survival outcomes with durvalumab led to some challenges in estimating the cost effectiveness of this therapy.Objective Here, we validate the survival extrapolations used in the original company base-case analysis by benchmarking them against updated survival data from the 4-year follow-up analysis of PACIFIC (i.e. approximately 4 years after the last patient was randomised; March 2020 DCO; median follow-up duration 34.2 months; range 0.2-64.9). Moreover, we update the original analysis with these more mature survival data to examine the consistency of key economic outputs with the original analysis.Methods The original analysis used a semi-Markov (state-transition) approach and was based on patients whose tumours expressed programmed cell death-ligand 1 on = 1% of cells (to reflect the European licence for durvalumab). We benchmarked the survival extrapolations used in the original company base- case analysis against survival data from the 4-year follow-up of PACIFIC and updated the cost-effectiveness analysis with these more mature survival data. Early deaths avoided by the adoption of durvalumab into the UK Cancer Drugs Fund (CDF) in March 2019 were estimated using the 4- year follow-up survival data and an assumed uptake of 125 patients/year (lower estimate) and 367 patients/year (higher estimate).Results The original company base-case analysis had a good visual fit with the observed overall survival (OS) distribution for the durvalumab arm and accurately predicted the 48-month OS rate (predicted 55%; observed 55%); by comparison, the fit was less precise for the placebo arm, for which the analysis underestimated the 48-month OS rate (predicted 32%; observed 38%). In the updated company base-case analysis, durvalumab yielded 2.51 incremental quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) (- 0.43 vs. the original company base-case analysis), corresponding to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of  pound 22,665/QALY (+ pound 3298 vs. the original analysis), which falls within the upper bound of NICE's willingness-to-pay threshold (30,000 pound/QALY gained). We estimate that between 31 and 91 early patient deaths may have been avoided by the adoption of durvalumab into the CDF.Conclusions These findings reinforce the patient benefit observed with durvalumab in unresectable stage III NSCLC, support the routine use and cost effectiveness of this therapy, and demonstrate how appropriate modelling can inform the early adoption of therapies by payers to achieve patient benefit.Plain Language SummaryBased on the results of a clinical trial, the European Medicines Agency approved durvalumab for the treatment of adults with a specific type of advanced lung cancer whose tumours cannot be removed surgically and whose disease has not progressed after chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invites companies to submit cost-effectiveness analyses to help with decision making about adopting new therapies. The company included an analysis based on early trial data that suggested durvalumab was cost effective compared with other previous treatments. As patients in the study at the time of the initial submission to NICE were only followed for approximately 2 years, the long-term survival benefit that could be achieved with durvalumab was uncertain. Therefore, NICE recommended durvalumab for use within the Cancer Drugs Fund (CDF) to allow patients to access the drug while more data were being collected. Here, we demonstrate that the original cost-effectiveness model accurately predicted the rates of long-term survival for patients receiving durvalumab and that durvalumab remains a cost-effective use of healthcare resources based on recently published data from the trial (which added approximately 2 further years of follow-up). Moreover, we estimate that adopting durvalumab into the CDF may have avoided 31-91 early patient deaths from lung cancer. These findings support NICE's early decision to make durvalumab available within the CDF and the adoption of durvalumab for routine use within the UK national health service.

TI  - Epigenetic regulation in cancer therapy: From mechanisms to clinical advances
T2  - MEDCOMM-ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Epigenetic regulation refers to the alteration of gene expression independent of changes in DNA sequence. It involves chemical modifications such as DNA methylation, histone methylation, and histone acetylation, which are regulated by a coordinated interplay of various regulators to ensure precise spatial and temporal regulation of gene expression. Epigenetic aberrations are commonly observed in cancer and are considered as hallmarks of cancer. In recent years, small molecules targeting specific epigenetic regulators have been developed and are demonstrating promising therapeutic potential in preclinical and clinical trials for cancer treatment. In this review, we summarize the essential regulatory mechanisms and dysfunctions of epigenetic regulators involved in DNA methylation, histone methylation, and histone acetylation during tumor development and progression. Moreover, we discuss the current advances and challenges in cancer epigenetic therapy that target these mechanisms in both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. Finally, we discuss the potential of combining epigenetic drugs with other therapies, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, as a promising approach for cancer treatment. Overall, we aim to enhance the understanding of epigenetic regulation in cancer therapy and explore targeted therapeutic strategies based on these mechanisms, to ultimately advance cancer therapy and improve patient prognosis.Epigenetic regulation involves chemical modifications including DNA methylation, histone methylation, and histone acetylation, which are governed by a coordinated interplay of various regulators. In cancer, epigenetic aberrations are commonly observed and considered as a hallmark of cancer. Small molecules have been developed to target specific epigenetic regulators and reverse the epigenetic reprogramming occurring in cancer. image

TI  - Real-World Outcomes of Subsequent Chemotherapy after Progression Following Chemoradiation and Consolidative Durvalumab Therapy in Locally Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer: An Exploratory Analysis from the CRIMSON Study (HOPE-005).
T2  - Clinical lung cancer
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: The optimal subsequent treatment strategy for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC) after chemoradiotherapy (CRT) and consolidative durvalumab therapy remains unknown. We aimed to determine the optimal subsequent treatment strategy for this clinical population.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled 523 consecutive patients with LA-NSCLC treated with CRT and analyzed the treatment outcomes of subsequent therapy after progression following CRT and consolidative durvalumab therapy. Patients who received tyrosine kinase inhibitors as subsequent therapy were excluded.RESULTS: Out of 122 patients who received subsequent chemotherapy, 55% underwent platinum-based, 25% non-platinum-based, and 20% immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-containing therapies. In the platinum-based group, patients with a durvalumab-progression-free survival (Dur-PFS) ≥ 1 year had a significantly longer median subsequent therapy-PFS (SubTx-PFS) than those with Dur-PFS < 1 year (13.2 months vs. 4.7 months; hazard ratio, 0.45; 95% confidence interval, 0.21-0.97; P = .04). Furthermore, among patients receiving non-platinum-based chemotherapy, the median SubTx-PFS was longer in the combined with angiogenesis inhibitor group than in the without group, although the difference was not statistically significant. No significant difference of SubTx-PFS was observed between the reason for durvalumab discontinuation and the outcomes of ICI-containing therapy.CONCLUSION: In clinical practice, platinum-based chemotherapy rechallenge is frequently employed following progression subsequent to CRT and consolidative durvalumab therapy for LA-NSCLC. Optimal treatment strategies may consider Dur-PFS and angiogenesis inhibitor feasibility. Further research is warranted to identify clinical biomarkers that can help identify patients who would benefit from ICI rechallenge.

TI  - Excessive esophageal toxicity in patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer treated with concurrent hypofractionated chemoradiotherapy and 3-weekly platinum doublet chemotherapy
T2  - CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL RADIATION ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Concurrent chemoradiation followed by immunotherapy is the standard of care for patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Prior to the introduction of adjuvant immunotherapy, we treated patients with stage III NSCLC with concurrent platinum doublet chemotherapy and 66 Gy in 24 fractions. We determined the toxicity of this treatment.Methods: A retrospective observational study was performed in a cohort of patients with stage III NSCLC, <70 years old, and WHO performance score 0-1. Patients were treated with concurrent platinum doublet chemotherapy and 66 Gy in 24 fractions. All patients were staged with a PET-scan and brain MRI-scan. Toxicity was scored using the common criteria for adverse events (CTCAE v4.03).Results: Between 2012 and 2017, 41 patients were treated with mildly hypofractionated radiotherapy and platinum doublet chemotherapy. The median follow-up was 4.7 years. The median age was 57 and 58% of patients were male. The majority of patients had stage IIIB disease (68%). The median total Gross Tumor Volume (GTV) was 104 cc (range: 15-367 cc). The median lymph node GTV was 59 cc (10-341 cc). Five patients died: four due to an esophagus perforation or fistula, and one due to pulmonary bleeding. Grade >= 3 esophageal toxicity occurred in 16 patients. Five patients had late grade >= 3 esophageal toxicity (12%). The median overall survival was 19 months.Conclusion: Toxicity was unexpectedly high in patients with stage III NSCLC (WHO 0-1) after concurrent platinum doublet chemotherapy and 66 Gy in 24 fractions.

AB  - PROJECT SUMMARY – TRANSLATIONAL THERAPEUTICS (TT)The Translational Therapeutics (TT) Program at The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center(OSUCCC), co-led by David Carbone, MD, PhD, Blake Peterson, PhD, and Elaine Mardis, PhD, unites anoutstanding team of 79 basic, translational and/or clinical researchers from 18 departments within The OhioState University (OSU) Colleges of Medicine, Pharmacy, and Veterinary Medicine and Nationwide Children’sHospital (NCH). The goal of the TT program is to translate advances in solid tumor molecular biology andpromising preclinical studies into innovative clinical trials to improve the state of the art in the diagnosis andtreatment of solid tumors. Solid tumors are by far the major causes of cancer death in our catchment area (thestate of Ohio), dominated by diseases of special interest in this program, including lung, breast, colorectal, headand neck, thyroid, and gynecologic cancers. As a result of existing expertise and collaborative scientific efforts,as well as focused recruitments across a spectrum of disciplines, the TT program exhibits strength in basic andtranslational research in lung cancer, gastrointestinal malignancies, breast cancer, sarcoma, and glioblastoma,as well as newly enhanced capabilities in drug development. The Specific Aims of the TT program are to: 1)identify and therapeutically target alterations in solid tumor proliferation and survival signaling pathways; 2)identify tumor-host interactions and target them via small molecule and immunotherapeutic approaches; and 3)develop and improve upon approaches for determining prognosis, selecting appropriate therapies, andevaluating the response to treatment. During the current funding cycle, the TT Program successfully recruited28 solid tumor clinicians, basic scientists, and physician-scientists. In addition, TT investigators produced 1130peer-reviewed publications; 178 of these were published in high impact (≥10) journals, 16% resulted from intra-programmatic collaborations, and 31% from inter-programmatic collaborations; 74% were multi-institutional; atotal of 86% were collaborative publications. TT members collaborated on programmatic grant submissions andwere awarded one NCI P01, two U01s, and two UG1s, as well as two T32 training grants. The TT Program has$9.2M in current annual direct costs from peer-reviewed grants, $6.6M (71%) of which is from the NCI. The TTProgram is well-integrated with the clinical teams via participation in the multidisciplinary Disease SpecificResearch Groups (DSRG) and organizes Pan-Disease Investigator-Initiated Trial meetings to catalyzeinteractions between DSRGs. As such, there were 4,070 accruals to interventional clinical trials during the lastfunding cycle, of which 3,351 (82%) were therapeutic, including 1,144 (28%) investigator-initiated trials. Futuredirections focused on the OSUCCC research priorities and cancers relevant to our catchment area and growthin cellular and checkpoint inhibitor research (adult and pediatric), immunogenomics, tumor resistance and tumorheterogeneity and small molecule drug development.

TI  - Drug-eluting beads bronchial arterial chemoembolization/ bronchial arterial infusion chemotherapy with and without PD-1 blockade for advanced non-small cell lung cancer: a comparative single-center cohort study
T2  - QUANTITATIVE IMAGING IN MEDICINE AND SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Drug-eluting beads bronchial arterial chemoembolization (DEB-BACE)/bronchial artery infusion chemotherapy (BAI) have been investigated as treatment options for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), especially for those patients who develop refractoriness to or are intolerant to systemic chemotherapy. This retrospective study aimed to compare the outcomes of DEB- BACE/BAI with and without programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) blockade for advanced NSCLC, and to investigate the effectiveness and safety of combination regimens.Methods: This retrospective cohort study included advanced NSCLC patients who were intolerant to or were resistant to systemic chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or molecular targeted therapy and underwent DEBBACE/BAI between October 2016 and October 2021 in Beijing Hospital, National Center of Gerontology. A total of 84 advanced NSCLC patients (DEB-BACE/BAI + PD-1 blockade group: group A, n=27; DEBBACE/BAI: group B, n=57) were enrolled finally. The embolic agent CalliSpheres (100-300, 300-500, or 500-700 mu m) loaded with gemcitabine (800 mg) was administered during the DEB-BACE procedure. The adverse events (AEs) and outcomes were compared. Of these, the median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were compared via Kaplan-Meier (KM) methods. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to investigate the predictors of PFS and OS.Results: KM methods showed that group A had longer median PFS (12.0 vs. 3.0 months, P<0.001) and OS (27.0 vs. 8.0 months, P<0.001) than group B. The predictors of PFS for DEB- BACE/BAI included tumor diameter (P=0.013), immunotherapy (P<0.001), and DEB-BACE/BAI cycles (P=0.012), whereas the predictors of OS included tumor diameter (P=0.021), extrapulmonary metastases (P=0.041), immunotherapy (P<0.001), and DEB-BACE/BAI cycles (P=0.020). The incidence rates of overall AEs in groups A and B were 40.7% (11/27) and 36.8% (21/57), respectively, and no significant difference was found (P=0.731). Group A had an incidence rate of 11.1% for grade 3 immunotherapy-related AEs (irAEs). There were no incidences of ectopic embolization or spinal artery injury.Conclusions: Compared with DEB-BACE/BAI, PD-1 blockade plus DEB-BACE/BAI could improve the prognosis for advanced NSCLC despite the associated risk of grade 3 irAEs. The combination regimens are promising and safe approaches for advanced NSCLC.

AB  - Objectives: The immunological and clinical responses of patients with NSCLC treated, in the context of an expanded action program, with the cryptic hTERT-targeting Vx-001 vaccine are presented.Materials and methods: Forty-six HLA-A*0201-positive patients with advanced NSCLC and residual (n = 27) or progressive (n = 19) disease following front-line treatment received two subcutaneous injections of the optimized TERT572Y peptide followed by four injections of the native TERT572 peptide, every 3 weeks. Peptide-specific immune responses were monitored by enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay at baseline, and after the 2nd and the 6th vaccinations. Thirty-eight HLA-A*0201-positive matched patients were used as historical controls.Results: Twenty-three patients (50%) completed the vaccination protocol and 87% received at least two administrations. Twelve patients (26%) without disease progression after the 6th vaccination received boost vaccinations. Three (7%) patients achieved a partial response and 13 (28%) disease stabilization. The disease control rate was significantly higher in patients with non-squamous histology compared to those with squamous-cell histology [n = 14 (45%) versus n = 2 (13%); p = 0.03]. The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) was 3.8 (range, 0.7-99.4) and 19.8 months (range, 0.7-99.4), respectively. Patients who developed immune response had a numerically higher PFS compared to those who failed to mount any (6.7 versus 2.7 months; p = 0.090). However, the median OS for the immune-responders was significantly prolonged compared to non-responders (40.0 versus 9.2 months, respectively; p = 0.02). Toxicity was <grade 2.Conclusion: Vx-001 vaccine is well tolerated and induced a TERT-specific immunological response, which was significantly correlated with improved clinical outcome.

TI  - Progression Patterns, Treatment, and Prognosis Beyond Resistance of Responders to Immunotherapy in Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionImmune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have changed the management of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, resistance is inevitable. The disease progression patterns, sequential treatment, and prognosis beyond ICI resistance are not completely understood.MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed stage IV NSCLC patients who underwent ICI treatment at Zhejiang Cancer Hospital between January 2016 and January 2020 and who suffered disease progression after at least stable disease on immunotherapy for more than 3 months (at least two cycles). Oligoprogression and systematic progression were defined as previous reports. The main outcome measures were progression-free survival (PFS), second PFS (PFS2), and overall survival (OS). Survival curves were plotted using the Kaplan-Meier method. The Cox proportional hazards model was used for multivariate analysis.ResultsTotally 1,014 NSCLC patients were administered immunotherapy. Of them, 208 NSCLC patients were included in this retrospective study. The estimated PFS, PFS2 and OS were 6.3 months (95% CI 5.6-7.0 months), 10.7 months (95% CI 10.1-12.7 months), and 21.4 months (95% CI 20.6-26.4 months), respectively. After resistance, 55.3% (N = 115) patients developed oligoprogression, and 44.7% (N = 93) systemic progression. For patients with systemic progression, chemotherapy (N = 35, 37.6%), best supportive care (N = 30, 32.3%), and antiangiogenic therapy alone (N = 11, 11.8%) were the major strategies. A combination of local radiotherapy (N = 38, 33.0%) with continued ICIs was the most common treatment used in oligoprogression group, followed by continued immunotherapy with antiangiogenic therapy (N = 19, 16.5%) and local radiotherapy only (N = 17, 14.9%). For patients with oligoprogression, continued immunotherapy plus local radiotherapy can lead to a significantly longer PFS2 (12.9 vs. 10.0 months; p = 0.006) and OS (26.3 vs. 18.5 months, p = 0.001). The PFS2 and OS of patients with oligoprogression were superior to those of patients with systemic progression (PFS2: 13.1 vs. 10.0 months, p = 0.001; OS: 25.8 vs. 19.1 months, p = 0.003).ConclusionsThe major progression pattern after acquired resistance from immunotherapy is oligoprogression. Local radiotherapy with continued immunotherapy beyond oligoprogression in responders was feasible and led to prolonged PFS2 and OS in advanced NSCLC patients.

TI  - Strategies to predict and overcome resistance to cancer immunotherapy
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - Immunotherapies such as PD-1 blockade have revolutionized cancer care. Yetmost patients do not experience sustained (durable) benefit from blockade of T cellinhibitory receptors. Unfortunately, current biomarkers do not adequately predict patientresponse or resistance to immunotherapy; and successful strategies to overcomeimmunotherapy resistance have been lacking. Both gaps reflect our incompleteunderstanding of how durable immunity carried out by T cells is achieved. Progenitor Tcells normally balance the mutually opposing demands of differentiation and self-renewal by transmitting unequal anabolic activating signals to daughter cells. In thesetting of cancer, however, sustained T cell activation skews the normalregenerative equilibrium of balanced differentiation and renewal towards progressivedysfunction of differentiated cells along with progressive loss of self-renewing T cells. Itwas previously presumed that PD-1 blockade acted by restoring potency to the mostdysfunctional T cells. Instead, emerging consensus has demonstrated that PD-1blockade can only function by inducing greater division and differentiation of self-renewing T cells, which are already in peril. This preclinical and translational applicationmarshals our basic discoveries concerning the signaling and cell biology of T cellregeneration to tackle a major clinical roadblock in cancer care. Performing the aims ofthis proposal will enable determination of 1) whether anti-cancer immunity andimmunotherapy impact the self-renewal of CD8+ T cells; 2) whether immunotherapy canbe improved by augmenting CD8+ T cell self-renewal; and 3) whether patient responseand resistance to immune checkpoint blockade can be predicted from the abundance ofself-renewing T cells. This proposal would address two critical unmet patient needs: anon-invasive predictive biomarker for response and resistance to immunotherapyacross cancer types; and a novel strategy for resistance-directed treatment enablingimmunotherapy to benefit the majority, rather than the minority of patients.

AB  - Abstract:Pediatric brain tumors are the leading cause of childhood cancer-related death1. The overall survival for pediatriclymphoblastic leukemia is over 90% at 5 years 2. In stark contrast, the overall survival of children with pediatrichigh-grade gliomas (pHGG) is less than 20% at 5-years. Remarkable progress has been made over the lastdecade in elucidating the origin and genomic landscape of childhood brain tumors 3. Despite these advances,pHGGs are mostly incurable, as current therapies rarely provide a greater survival benefit over the currentstandard of care, focal radiation. The few survivors with pHGG are often left with devastating side effects,including endocrine morbidity, psychiatric and neurocognitive impairments, developmental disorders,neurological disease, and a high incidence of secondary tumors4-6. These side effects further highlight thenecessity of developing novel treatment modalities, ideally with minimal toxicity while maintaining significantprognostic outcomes for children with pHGG. Immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) resulted in an unprecedentedresponse rate in many cancer types, including cancers in advanced metastatic stages such as melanoma andnon-small cell lung cancer 7-9. Unfortunately, ICI has largely failed to produce benefits in pHGG, with theexception of patients harboring constitutional mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency syndrome (CMMRD) 10-13.Based on limited data from literature and our preliminary observations, we hypothesize that biallelic germlineMMR mutations in pHGG result in enhanced ICI response while somatic MMR mutations do not. We furtherhypothesize that stromal MMR mutations drive enhanced ICI response by reversing the immunosuppressivephenotype of innate immune cell called tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in the tumor microenvironment(TME). TAMs are the most-abundant non-neoplastic cell infiltrates in the TME and express the highest levels ofPD-L114,15, a ligand for the programmed cell death-1 receptor (PD-1) on effector T-cells. To test our hypothesis,we developed genetic models of germline and somatic MMR mutant pHGG and propose to use these models tocompare their expression profiles to human pHGG samples from CMMRD and non-CMMRD patients. We willalso use these models to determine whether there is a casual link between germline biallelic MMR mutation andresponse to anti-PD-L1 therapy. The clinical benefits of this high-risk high-reward application are two-fold. First,it will establish whether there is a causal link between biallelic MMR mutation in pHGG and immunotherapyresponse. If the link exists it will contribute to our understanding of the primary resistance to checkpoint inhibitorsin children with pHGG and subsequently, how to target such mechanisms. Second, CMMRD tumors are resistantto conventional therapies, since several common chemotherapeutic agents, including temozolomide, requireadequate mismatch repair to exert their cytotoxic effects. Patients with CMMRD tumors thus require noveltherapeutic strategies, and our studies will mechanistically establish whether or not ICI elicits an enhanced anti-tumor response in these tumors.

TI  - Targeted therapies for the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer: monoclonal antibodies and biological inhibitors
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - The usual treatments for patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), such as advanced lung adenocarcinoma, are unspecific and aggressive, and include lung resection, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Recently, treatment with monoclonal antibodies and biological inhibitors has emerged as an effective alternative, generating effective results with few side effects. In recent years, several clinical trials using monoclonal antibodies presented potential benefits to NSCLC, and 4 of them are already approved for the treatment of NSCLC, such as cetuximab, bevacizumab, nivolumab and pembrolizumab. Also, biological inhibitors are attractive tolls for biological applications. Among the approved inhibitors are crizotinib, erlotinib, afatinib and gefitinib, and side effects are usually mild to intense. Nevertheless, biological molecule treatments are under development, and several new monoclonal antibodies and biological inhibitors are in trial to treat NSCLC. Also under trial study are as follows: anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibodies (nimotuzumab and ficlatuzumab), anti-IGF 1 receptor (IGF-1R) monoclonal antibody (figitumumab), anti-NR-LU-10 monoclonal antibody (nofetumomab) as well as antibodies directly affecting the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) molecule (ipilimumab and tremelimumab), to receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand (RANKL) (denosumab) or to polymerase enzyme (veliparib and olaparib). Among new inhibitors under investigation are poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (veliparib and olaparib) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor (buparlisib). However, the success of immunotherapies still requires extensive research and additional controlled trials to evaluate the long-term benefits and side effects. (AU)

T2  - RESPIRATORY MEDICINE CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Osimertinib is a third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets mutant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The success of FLAURA and ADAURA trials prompted the license of Osimertinib for the treatment of EGFR mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) at advanced stage and for patients with stages IB to IIIA disease in post-operative setting. In the present study, we described neoadjuvant use of Osimertinib in an EGFR mutant NSCLC patient with locally metastatic disease (T2aN2M0). Intriguingly, the cavitated NSCLC resembled an impressive"Halloween pumpkin" appearance that dramatically responded to Osimertinib treatment. Downstaging of N2 metastatic disease was reached and surgical resection was scheduled. The postoperative clinical stage was IA3. The patient was recommended to continue Osimertinib adjuvant treatment and our follow-ups showed no signs of disease recurrence. Our case study underscored the feasibility of Osimertinib as a neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy for patients with locally advanced EGFR mutant NSCLC.

M3  - Review
AB  - Background:Epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) are considered as the first-line treatment for advanced EGFR mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We aimed to analyze the efficacy of EGFR-TKIs treatment in patients with advanced NSCLC of different smoking habits.Methods:We conducted a search for meta-analyses and systematic reviews on the PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library to address this knowledge gap. Patients were divided into 2 groups: (1) experimental group: treated with EGFR-TKIs or EGFR-TKIs combined with chemotherapy, immunotherapy, antiangiogenesis, radiotherapy and (2) control group: treated with chemotherapy. Progressive-free survival (PFS) and total survival (OS) were adopted for evaluating the efficacy of EGFR-TKIs between experimental group and control group.Results:Eleven studies including 6760 patients were included in the meta-analysis. The results showed that smoking (including previous and current smoking) significantly reduces the PFS and OS in comparison to non-smoking group in the treatment of NSCLC with EGFR-TKIs. In addition, EGFR-TKIs combined with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy can reduce the risk of disease progression in smokers.Conclusions:Our study indicated that smoking significantly reduced the PFS and OS in comparison to non-smoking group in the treatment of NSCLC with EGFR-TKIs.

TI  - Characterizing ALCAM as an oncoprotein and immunotherapeutic target in neuroblastoma
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - Project SummaryNeuroblastoma is a pediatric extracranial solid malignancy that arises from the developing sympathetic nervoussystem. Patients with high risk neuroblastoma face five-year survival rates of only 50%, despite intensiveintervention with chemotherapy, surgery, radiation, and immunotherapy. Development of new therapies forneuroblastoma has been challenging due to the paucity of targetable oncogenic mutations. However, recentapproval of monoclonal antibody therapy targeting GD2 has credentialed immunotherapy as a new avenue oftherapeutic development in neuroblastoma. Conversely anti-GD2 therapy causes significant on-target, off-tumortoxicity due to the presence of GD2 on nociceptive neurons, and relapse due to loss of GD2 expression remainscommon. To subvert antigen downregulation as a mechanism of resistance, our lab focuses on development ofimmunotherapy targets that are both differentially expressed and necessary for tumor survival. We recentlyidentified the cell adhesion molecule ALCAM as a potential target for immunotherapy development. ALCAM is acellular adhesion molecule involved in retinal ganglion development, and high ALCAM expression is a negativeprognostic marker in a variety of cancers. Our RNA-sequencing data shows ALCAM is highly expressed in mostpatient neuroblastomas. Furthermore, an ALCAM-targeted antibody-drug conjugate, CX-2009, is currently inclinical trials for advanced metastatic or locally unresectable adult cancers. This project aims to discover themechanism of ALCAM overexpression in neuroblastoma, as well as define the contribution of ALCAMoverexpression to tumor growth and metastasis. Preliminary data suggests shRNA-mediated ALCAMknockdown induces neurite formation in vitro, a phenotype associated with differentiation. Additionally, ChIP-sequencing data from two neuroblastoma cell lines shows expression ALCAM may be regulated by a network oftranscription factors termed the core regulatory circuit (CRC). The CRC is a feed-forward transcriptionalregulatory circuit in which each transcription factor regulates the expression of itself and the others, togetherdefining a noradrenergic phenotype characterized by expression of proteins such as tyrosine hydroxylase anddopamine beta hydroxylase. By integrating bioinformatics and molecular biology approaches, we will uncoverthe mechanism of ALCAM overexpression in neuroblastoma. More broadly, this project will credential ALCAMas a viable target of immunotherapy, as well as an oncoprotein necessary for tumor survival.

Methods: We retrospectively collected patients with advanced or recurrent NSCLC who received SBRT concurrently with ICI in our institution between January 2017 and December 2021. Patients were divided into two groups, including those for whom SBRT was delivered initially or to the residual tumors during the first- or laterline ICI treatment (Group 1), and those for whom SBRT was given to the progressed tumors irrespective of firstor later-line ICI treatment (Group 2). Results: A total of 144 patients were included. With median follow-up duration of 25.6 (range: 3.6 to 56.2) months, median progression-free survival (PFS) was 13.7 (95 % CI: 10.4 to 17.1) months and median overall survival (OS) was 52.8 [95 % CI: 30.6 to not available (NA)] months. In Group 1 (n = 78), median PFS was 17.9 (95 % CI: 14.5 to 29.8) months while median OS was not reached and 5-year OS rate was 61.2 %. In Group 2 (n = 66), median PFS was 8.0 (95 % CI: 6.0 to 13.1) months and median OS was 30.6 (95 % CI: 21.5 to NA) months. Conclusions: SBRT combined with ICI demonstrated favorable survival for advanced or recurrent NSCLC, delivered in a controlled-disease situation as well as to progressed diseases with salvage-intent. Future prospective studies are warranted to investigate the optimal SBRT dose regimen and appropriate combination strategy to synergize ICI.

TI  - Immunotherapeutic Approaches to Sarcoma
T2  - CURRENT TREATMENT OPTIONS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Current therapies in advanced sarcomas are primarily based on cytotoxic chemotherapy and have modest efficacy coupled with significant toxicity. Little progress has been made in the field since imatinib was approved for the treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) in 2002 despite the recent FDA approval of the multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor pazopanib. Novel therapies are clearly needed. Immunotherapy utilizing checkpoint inhibitors has yielded significant clinical benefit in multiple solid tumors manifesting as durable responses in melanoma, kidney, lung, and bladder cancers, as well as hematologic malignancies. Given the success in several "non-immunogenic" tumors and recent preclinical data, there is sufficient evidence to support the use of immunotherapy in sarcoma. Cytokine-based therapies have shown no benefit in the advanced setting. Two large randomized trials of muramyl tripeptide or of interferon maintenance in resected osteosarcoma patients did not provide unequivocal statistically significant benefit. More promising results have been reported in small studies evaluating vaccines and adoptive T cell therapy in specific subtypes of sarcoma such as synovial sarcoma, which widely expresses the immunogenic cancer testis antigen NY-ESO-1. Emerging approaches with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-engineered T cells are hypothesis-generating and thought-provoking. However, the unprecedented clinical activity and excellent safety profile of checkpoint inhibitors targeting programmed death-1 receptor and its ligand (PD-1/PD-L1) have galvanized the field and generated much enthusiasm to harness the power of immunotherapy in pursuit of cures in patients with advanced sarcomas. An ongoing phase II study (SARC028) will hopefully usher an era of investigation of this exciting approach in sarcoma. However, it is unlikely that one agent will carry a universal cure and future approaches need to focus on patient selection as well as on identifying the optimal combination of checkpoint inhibitors with targeted therapy, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy.

TI  - Development of polymeric synthetic biomaterial IP-001 to potentiate asystemic immunotherapy of hepatocellular carcinoma via thermal ablation
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - Abstract: Immunophotonics is a biotech company developing a synthetic biopolymer, IP-001, to potentiate asystemic immunotherapy via microwave (MWA) thermal tumor ablation for treatment of Hepatocellularcarcinoma (HCC). The goal of this SBIR Fast Track is to complete preclinical safety and efficacy testing tosupport an investigational new drug (IND) application based on the feedback from a meeting with the FDA.Significance: HCC is the fourth most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide, with 42,030 newcases in the U.S. in 2019. This rise is partly due to an increase in hepatitis-induced cirrhosis and non-alcoholicsteatohepatitis (NASH) associated with obesity and diabetes. Currently, hepatic transplant and surgicalresection provide the best opportunity for long term remission, but less than 20% of patients are eligible. Non-surgical candidates with regional disease only have a 10.8% five-year survival rate. Thermal liver ablativetherapies like MWA are a standard of care alternative to surgeries for BCLC stage 0, A and a subset of stage BHCC patients. However, ablation targets only local tumors, and systemic tumoricidal effects on micro-metastasisare rare, leading to recurrence rate of around 70% after two years. Better therapies for HCC are needed.Product: IP-001 is intended for intratumoral injection immediately after thermal ablation (MWA). It acts by 1)localizing tumor antigens liberated by ablation and prolonging their availability to the immune system and 2)activating immune cells such as antigen-presenting cells. This results in a stronger systemic T cell responsethat can reduce local recurrence, eliminate metastases, and elicit long-term memory. Investigator-driven trialsin advanced breast cancer show a favorable toxicity profile and early signs of systemic efficacy, with somecomplete responders achieving long-term remission. The company has received clinical trial application (CTA)approval in Switzerland to begin a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in melanoma and soft tissue sarcoma.Impact: In HCC patients who receive MWA ablation, IP-001 aims to lower recurrence by 50% in stage 0, A & Bpatients and prolong progression-free survival by 50% and overall survival in stage B & C patients with regionaldisease. IP-001 could revolutionize the field of interventional oncology by transforming it into a means of earlyimmunotherapy that is broadly applicable to other solid cancers without disruption to the standard of care.Approach and Specific Aims: In the Phase I, Immunophotonics will generate feasibility data of MWA+ IP-001in orthotopic rat HCC model H-4-II-E (in collaboration with Dr. Rob Martin at the University of Louisville) to 1)establish efficacy and generate data demonstrating heightened systemic immune stimulation against cancer,2) explore potential synergism with systemic immunotherapy, i.e. checkpoint inhibitor anti-PD-1 in mouse HCCmodel Hepa1-6. In the Phase II segment, Immunophotonics will further determine 1) maximum tolerated doseof IP-001 for liver injection, 2) impacts of common comorbidity NASH/cirrhosis on treatment efficacy, and 3)will develop CMC methods for scaling up and analysis of the drug product.

AB  - Project Summary/AbstractTherapies against immunologic checkpoint proteins, such as PD-L1, have revolutionized the treatment of multiplemalignancies, such as malignant melanoma, lung cancer, bladder cancer, or gastroesophageal cancer. All of thesetherapies depend on predictive biomarker assays for PD-L1 protein expression in tumor tissue to identify patients whowill most likely respond. PD-L1 assays face two significant challenges: (i) they often need to be performed on small tissuebiopsies where tumor tissue is limited and (ii) the threshold for positivity by immunohistochemistry (1%) is very small,highlighting crucial dependence on utmost precision and pre-analytical sample validity.To address the issue of small and limited samples in biopsies, we have developed a chromogenic multiplexedimmunohistochemical assay that combines PD-L1 assessment with tissue and cell type-specific markers to provide acombined diagnostic and predictive assay on a single histologic slide. To move multiplexed assays around PD-L1 into theclinic, there exists an important knowledge gap: what are the patient-specific factors and specimen-related pre-analyticalvariables that can influence the readout of PD-L1 positivity? Very limited knowledge is available about these variables.Importantly, because the PD-L1 positivity threshold is so low and requires the reliable separation of two very smallnumbers (<1% vs. ≥1%), even minute pre-analytical variabilities would be expected to have significant negative impact onassay validity. In that respect, PD-L1 testing in tissue is particularly in need of extensive characterization and control ofpre-analytical variability, even more so than other assays whose cut-off points lie in more favorable ranges.Our proposal is based on the hypothesis that both patient-specific factors (such as molecular features of the cancer,current immune status, prior drug therapy, etc.) and specimen-related factors (such as timing of biopsy, size of tissue,ischemic time, fixation protocol, etc.) can significantly influence subsequent biomarker measurements. We furtherhypothesize that solid knowledge about these influences will allow controlling for and mitigating patient-specific andspecimen-related effects and will lead to more accurate and valid biomarker assessment. Aim 1: We will create a cohortto test the influence of patient-specific context factors. We will make use of our extensive immuno-oncology databaseand biobank of >5,000 patients. Aim 2: We will test how specimen-related pre-analytical variables affect the assay usinga wide variety of fresh, frozen, and formalin fixed tissue types and sizes. Aim 3: Once we have defined optimal patient-specific and specimen-related procedures, we will validate our multiplex assay in a prospective cohort of immunotherapypatients at MSKCC.Significance: This project will yield abundant data about the pre-analytical variables that influence a PD-L1 multipleximmunohistochemistry assay. These data will inform optimal specimen acquisition and handling and strategies foravoiding or mitigating inaccurate assay results. Innovation: This will be the first study to systematically explore bothpatient context factors and specimen pre-analytics in multiplexed immunohistochemical testing for immuno-oncology.Our close collaboration with commercial test developers as part of our research team will accelerate the translation ofour scientific findings into optimized assays for the direct benefit of patients.

AB  - A controlled, randomized study has been conducted to assess the efficacy of adoptive immunotherapy with Interleukin 2(IL2)and lymphokine activated killer cells(LAK cells)combined with chemotherapy or radiotherapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer(NSCLC)patients. Out of 403 NSCLC patients who received resection of primary tumors from Jan. 1985 to Dec. 1990 in our hospital, a total of 106 patients with relatively curative and non-curative resection, were entered into a randomized controlled trial of postoperative adjuvant immunotherapy. The former group(n=36)was divided into three groups ; a)Chemotherapy(CDDP+VDS)group(n=13), b)Chemoimmunotherapy(CDDP+VDS+IL2+LAK cells)group(n=12), and c)control group(n=ll). The latter(noncurative)group(n=68)was randomized into d)immunotherapy(chemo/radiotherapy+IL2+LAK cells)group(n=33)and e)control(chemo/radiotherapy alone)group(n=35).The overall 4 year survival rates of immunotherapy(b+d)and control(a+c+e)groups were 52.4% and 28.3% respectively and the difference was significant(p<0.01)with generalized Wilcoxon test. In the relative curative group, the 4 year survival rates of a), b), and c)groups were 34.2%, 70.9% and 34.1% respectively. In the non-curative group, those of d)and e)groups were 43.1% and 29.3%(p<0.05). From this study, it it suggested that adoptive immunotherapy with IL2 and LAK cells is effective as a postoperative adjuvant immunotherapy for advanced NSCLC patients.

TI  - Emerging precision neoadjuvant systemic therapy for patients with resectable non-small cell lung cancer: current status and perspectives
T2  - BIOMARKER RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Over the past decade, targeted therapy for oncogene-driven NSCLC and immune checkpoint inhibitors for non-oncogene-driven NSCLC, respectively, have greatly improved the survival and quality of life for patients with unresectable NSCLC. Increasingly, these biomarker-guided systemic therapies given before or after surgery have been used in patients with early-stage NSCLC. In March 2022, the US FDA granted the approval of neoadjuvant nivolumab and chemotherapy for patients with stage IB-IIIA NSCLC. Several phase II/III trials are evaluating the clinical efficacy of various neoadjuvant immune checkpoint inhibitor combinations for non-oncogene-driven NSCLC and neoadjuvant molecular targeted therapies for oncogene-driven NSCLC, respectively. However, clinical application of precision neoadjuvant treatment requires a paradigm shift in the biomarker testing and multidisciplinary collaboration at the diagnosis of early-stage NSCLC. In this comprehensive review, we summarize the current diagnosis and treatment landscape, recent advances, new challenges in biomarker testing and endpoint selections, practical considerations for a timely multidisciplinary collaboration at diagnosis, and perspectives in emerging neoadjuvant precision systemic therapy for patients with resectable, early-stage NSCLC. These biomarker-guided neoadjuvant therapies hold the promise to improve surgical and pathological outcomes, reduce systemic recurrences, guide postoperative therapy, and improve cure rates in patients with resectable NSCLC.

TI  - Pembrolizumab Plus Concurrent Chemoradiation Therapy in Patients With Unresectable, Locally Advanced, Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer The Phase 2 KEYNOTE-799 Nonrandomized Trial
T2  - JAMA ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - IMPORTANCE Administration of pembrolizumab plus concurrent chemoradiation therapy (cCRT) may provide treatment benefit to patients with locally advanced, stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).OBJECTIVE To evaluate treatment outcomes and safety of pembrolizumab plus cCRT in stage III NSCLC.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The phase 2, nonrandomized, 2-cohort, open-label KEYNOTE-799 study enrolled patients between November 5, 2018, and July 31, 2020, from 52 academic facilities and community-based institutions across 10 countries. As of October 28, 2020, median (range) follow-up was 18.5 (13.6-23.8) months in cohort A and 13.7 (2.9-23.5) months in cohort B. Of 301 patients screened, 216 eligible patients with previously untreated, unresectable, and pathologically/radiologically confirmed stage IIIA/IIIB/IIIC NSCLC with measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) were enrolled.INTERVENTIONS Patients in cohort A (squamous/nonsquamous) received 1 cycle (3 weeks) of carboplatin (area under the curve [AUC] 6mg/mL/min), paclitaxel (200mg/m(2)), and pembrolizumab (200mg), followed by carboplatin (AUC 2mg/mL/min) and paclitaxel (45 mg/m2) once weekly for 6 weeks and 2 cycles of pembrolizumab plus standard thoracic radiotherapy. Patients in cohort B (nonsquamous) received 3 cycles of cisplatin (75mg/m(2)), pemetrexed (500mg/m(2)), and pembrolizumab (200mg) every 3 weeks and thoracic radiotherapy in cycles 2 and 3. Patients received 14 additional cycles of pembrolizumab.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Coprimary end pointswere objective response rate per RECIST v1.1 by blinded independent central review and incidence of grade 3 to 5 pneumonitis.RESULTS A total of 112 patients received treatment in cohort A ( 76 men [67.9%]; median [range] age, 66.0 [46-90] years; 66 patients [58.9%] with programmed cell death ligand 1 [PD-L1] tumor proportion score >= 1%) and 102 patients received treatment in cohort B (62 men [60.8%]; median [range] age, 64.0 [35-81] years; 40 patients [39.2%] with PD-L1 tumor proportion score >= 1%). Objective response rate was 70.5%(79 of 112; 95% CI, 61.2%-78.8%) in cohort A and 70.6%(72 of 102; 95% CI, 60.7%-79.2%) in cohort B. Median duration of response was not reached, but 79.7% and 75.6%, respectively, had response duration of 12 months or longer. Grade 3 or higher pneumonitis occurred in 9 of 112 patients (8.0%) in cohort A and 7 of 102 (6.9%) in cohort B. Grade 3 to 5 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 72 of 112 (64.3%) and 51 of 102 (50.0%) patients, respectively.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The findings of this phase 2, nonrandomized, 2-cohort study suggest promising antitumor activity of pembrolizumab plus cCRT and manageable safety in patients with previously untreated, locally advanced, stage III NSCLC.

AB  - Objective The study aims to investigate the role of dynamic [18F]FDG PET/CT imaging by high-sensitivity PET/CT scanner for assessing patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC) who undergo induction immuno-chemotherapy, followed by concurrent hypo-fractionated chemoradiotherapy (hypo-CCRT) and consolidative immunotherapy. Methods Patients with unresectable LA-NSCLC are prospectively recruited. Dynamic [18F]FDG PET/CT scans are conducted at four timepoints: before treatment (Baseline), after induction immuno-chemotherapy (Post-IC), during hypo-CCRT (Mid-hypo-CCRT) and after hypo-CCRT (Post-hypo-CCRT). The primary lung tumors (PTs) are manually delineated, and the metabolic features, including the Patlak-Ki (Ki), maximum SUV (SUVmax), metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) have been evaluated. The expressions of CD3, CD8, CD68, CD163, CD34 and Ki67 in primary lung tumors at baseline are assayed by immunohistochemistry. The levels of blood lymphocytes at four timepoints are analyzed with flow cytometry. Results Fifteen LA-NSCLC patients are enrolled between December 2020 and December 2022. Baseline Ki of primary tumor yields the highest AUC values of 0.722 and 0.796 for predicting disease progression and patient death, respectively. Patients are classified into the High FDG Ki group (n = 8, Ki > 2.779 ml/min/100 g) and the Low FDG Ki group (n = 7, Ki <= 2.779 ml/min/100 g). The High FDG Ki group presents better progression-free survival (P = 0.01) and overall survival (P = 0.025). The High FDG Ki group exhibits more significant reductions in Ki after hypo-CCRT compared to the Low FDG Ki group. Patients with a reduction in Ki > 73.1% exhibit better progression-free survival than those with a reduction <= 73.1% in Ki (median: not reached vs. 7.33 months, P = 0.12). The levels of CD3(+) T cells (P = 0.003), CD8(+) T cells (P = 0.002), CD68(+) macrophages (P = 0.071) and CD163(+) macrophages (P = 0.012) in primary tumor tissues are higher in the High FDG Ki group. The High FDG Ki group has higher CD3(+)CD8(+) lymphocytes in blood at baseline (P = 0.108), post-IC (P = 0.023) and post-hypo-CCRT (P = 0.041) than the Low FDG Ki group. Conclusions The metabolic features in the High FDG Ki group significantly decrease during the treatment, particularly after induction immuno-chemotherapy. The Ki value of primary tumor shows significant relationship with the treatment response and survival in LA-NSCLC patients by the combined immuno-chemoradiotherapy regimen.

TI  - Drug-Eluting Bead Bronchial Arterial Chemoembolization With and Without Microwave Ablation for the Treatment of Advanced and Standard Treatment-Refractory/Ineligible Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Comparative Study
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeTo compare the outcomes of drug-eluting bead bronchial arterial chemoembolization (DEB-BACE) with and without microwave ablation (MWA) for the treatment of advanced and standard treatment-refractory/ineligible non-small cell lung cancer (ASTRI-NSCLC). Materials and MethodsA total of 77 ASTRI-NSCLC patients who received DEB-BACE combined with MWA (group A; n = 28) or DEB-BACE alone (group B; n = 49) were included. Clinical outcomes were compared between groups A and B. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to compare the median progression-free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS) between the two groups. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards analyses were used to investigate the predictors of OS for ASTRI-NSCLC treated with DEB-BACE. ResultsNo severe adverse event was found in both groups. Pneumothorax was the predominant MWA-related complication in group A, with an incidence rate of 32.1% (9/28). Meanwhile, no significant difference was found in DEB-BACE-related complications between groups A and B. The overall disease control rate (DCR) was 61.0% (47/77), with a significantly higher DCR in group A (85.7% vs. 46.9%, P = 0.002). The median PFS in groups A and B was 7.0 and 4.0 months, respectively, with a significant difference (P = 0.037). The median OS in groups A and B was both 8.0 months, with no significant difference (P = 0.318). The 6-month PFS and OS rates in groups A and B were 75.0% and 78.6%, 22.4% and 59.2%, respectively, while the 12-month PFS and OS rates in groups A and B were 17.9% and 28.6%, 14.3% and 22.4%, respectively. Of these, a significantly higher 6-month PFS rate was found in group A (75.0% vs. 22.4%; P < 0.001). The cycles of DEB-BACE/bronchial artery infusion chemotherapy [hazard ratio (HR): 0.363; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.202-0.655; P = 0.001] and postoperative immunotherapy (HR: 0.219; 95% CI: 0.085-0.561; P = 0.002) were identified as the predictors of OS in ASTRI-NSCLC treated with DEB-BACE. ConclusionMWA sequentially combined with DEB-BACE was superior to DEB-BACE alone in the local control of ASTRI-NSCLC. Although the combination therapy reveals a trend of prolonging the OS, long-term prognosis warrants an investigation with a longer follow-up.

TI  - Predictor Value of PD-L1 for Radiotherapy Response in Locally Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
T2  - TURK ONKOLOJI DERGISI-TURKISH JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVEThe discovery of PD-L1 receptors triggered a great interest in immunotherapeutics for the management of locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The efficacy of immunotherapeutics for overall survival (OS) in locally advanced NSCLC has been proven in several clinical trials. However, no data exist for the relationship between radiotherapy (RT) response and programmed death-ligand (PD-L1) receptor positivity in the literature. In this regard, we aimed to investigate the predictor value of PD-L1 receptors for RT response.METHODSEighty patients who were diagnosed as having locally advanced NSCLC were selected from among patients in whom PD-L1 status was assessed in the Gazi University pathology laboratory. The relationship between PD-L1 and progression-free survival (PFS), OS, metastasis-free survival (MFS), RT response, and RT doses was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analysis. Chi-square and t-tests were used for descriptive statistics.RESULTSThe median follow-up was 16.1 months. The mean age was 61.1 years. PD-L1 positivity was detected in 34 patients. One year and 2-year OS and PFS ratios were found as 87%, 54% and 65%, 30%, respectively. The median OS and PFS were 26.8 and 15.1 months, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between PD-L1 receptor status and OS and PFS (p=0.736 and p=0.372, respectively). In the PD-L1 positive subgroup analysis for OS, doses higher than 60 Gy (n=28, mean dose 64.6 +/- 1.53) were found superior to the 60 Gy dose (n=6) (p=0.034). The median MFS was 33 months.CONCLUSIONPD-L1 status did not seem to be a predictor for RT response. However, despite the low number of patients in the 60 Gy group, our study showed that dose-escalation could improve survival in PD-L1 positive locally advanced NSCLC.

TI  - Characterizing immune-mediated adverse events with durvalumab in patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC: A post-hoc analysis of the PACIFIC trial
T2  - LUNG CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Immune-mediated adverse events (imAEs), including all-cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, were reported in approximately 25% of patients in the placebo-controlled, phase III PACIFIC trial of durvalumab monotherapy (for up to 12 months) in patients with unresectable, stage III NSCLC and no disease progression after concurrent chemoradiotherapy; only 3.4% of patients experienced grade 3/4 imAEs. With broad application of the PACIFIC regimen (consolidation durvalumab after chemoradiotherapy), now standard-of-care in this setting, there is a need to better characterize the occurrence of imAEs with this regimen.Methods: We performed descriptive, post-hoc, exploratory analyses to characterize the occurrence of imAEs (pneumonitis and non-pneumonitis) in PACIFIC in terms of: incidence, severity, and timing; clinical management and outcomes; and associations between the occurrence of imAEs and (1) all-cause AEs and (2) baseline patient, disease, and treatment characteristics.Results: Any-grade immune-mediated pneumonitis (9.4%) and non-pneumonitis imAEs (10.7%) occurred infrequently and were more common with durvalumab versus placebo. Grade 3/4 immune-mediated pneumonitis (1.9%) and non-pneumonitis imAEs (1.7%) were uncommon with durvalumab, as were fatal imAEs (0.8%; all pneumonitis). The most common non-pneumonitis imAEs with durvalumab were thyroid disorders, dermatitis/ rash, and diarrhea/colitis. Dermatitis/rash had the shortest time to onset (from durvalumab initiation), followed by pneumonitis; dermatitis/rash had the longest time to resolution, followed by thyroid disorders. Most patients with immune-mediated pneumonitis (78.4%) and non-pneumonitis imAEs (56.3%) had these events occur <= 3 months after initiating durvalumab. ImAEs were well managed with administration of systemic corticosteroids, administration of endocrine replacement therapy, and interruption/discontinuation of durvalumab. Time elapsed from completion of prior radiotherapy to trial randomization (< 14 vs. >= 14 days) did not impact either incidence or severity of imAEs. Durvalumab had a manageable safety profile broadly irrespective of whether patients experienced imAEs.Conclusion: The risk of imAEs should not deter use of the PACIFIC regimen in eligible patients, as these events are generally well managed through appropriate clinical intervention.

AB  - Introduction This report investigates the impact of systemic treatments (chemotherapy or immunotherapy) with(out) loco-regional radiotherapy, on HRQoL, toxicity and neurocognitive functioning (NCF) in locally advanced and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer patients enrolled in the PRO-Long study. Materials and Methods Data on patient-reported HRQoL and fourteen toxicities was collected, while NCF was tested, up to one-year post-treatment. HRQoL was assessed using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30. Lung cancer, treatment and neuro-psychological related toxicities were scored with the Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. NCF was evaluated with six neurocognitive tests. Mixed model analyses were conducted to determine statistical significance (p = .01). Meaningful clinical important differences (MCIDs) were applied for changes in HRQoL and NCF data, while toxicities were compared to baseline values. Results In total, 50 patients were enrolled. Overall HRQoL (p = .357) nor its domains (physical, p = .643; role, p = .069; emotional, p = .254; cognitive, p = 494; social, p = .735) changed significantly over time. Meaningful improvements in overall HRQoL were seen in 22, 38 and 39% and deteriorations in 22, 5 and 28% of patients at 2-3, 6 and 12 months respectively post-treatment. Overall toxicity (p = .007), lack of appetite (p = .001), nausea (p = .004) and dysphagia (p = .000) significantly decreased over time. Treatment caused acute toxicity, such as dyspnoea (45%) and memory problems (42%), but also alleviated pre-existing symptoms, including lack of appetite (32%), anxiety (29%) and depression (28%) at 2/3 months. The NCF domains of visual memory (p = .000) and cognitive processing speed (p = .000) showed significant improvements over time. In terms of MCIDs, at 2-3 months (18%) and 6 months (15%), verbal memory was particularly impacted; at 12 months, visual memory (18%) and executive function (18%) deteriorated primarily. Conclusion The results suggest that therapy has no significant negative impact on overall HRQoL, its domains, and NCF. About one-third of patients reported a meaningful improved HRQoL at 1 year post-treatment. Treatment caused toxicity, but also alleviated pre-existing symptoms.

T2  - Ecancermedicalscience
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The 'Future Horizons in Lung Cancer' meeting was designed to bring leading scientists together alongside clinicians to discuss the most recent advances in lung cancer pathophysiology and treatment. The aim was to take those attending the event on a journey through decades of lung cancer research and understanding, with topics spanning from screening and surgical care to "omics" approaches for drug target and biomarker discovery. There were also several talks describing the role of radiotherapy in lung cancer and advancements in imaging techniques, aiding surgeons in their attempts to resect early lesions. Current standards of care were both challenged and celebrated, while new and innovative immunotherapies also came into the spotlight. The meeting, held over two days, attracted a high calibre of speakers and delegates from across the globe. There were 10 sessions in total focusing on the latest therapeutic advances and predictions for the future of lung cancer treatment. Highlights included a key note lecture from Dr Frances Shepherd packing 40 years of lung cancer research into a 40-minute presentation. Heated debates were had regarding the validity of maintenance therapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors that have taken the research community by storm. The latest developments in imaging, surgery, systemic and radiotherapy were presented over 10 sessions of exciting, innovative and stimulating presentations, leaving the audience lively yet pensive.

TI  - Radio-immunotherapy to Target Cancer Stem Cells in Solid Tumor Malignancies
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - ﻿   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cancer stem cells (CSCs) or tumor-initiating cells are a small subset of malignant cells which are resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy (RT) and are able to repopulate a tumor after cytotoxic treatment. It is these quiescent cells which can seed cancer relapse and metastasis, even in cases of apparent complete response to treatment. Immunotherapy offers a tremendous advantage over cytotoxic therapies to target CSCs because immune effector cells do not require targets to be actively proliferating. Therefore, immune-mediated killing appears to be an attractive candidate for targeting CSCs following the depletion of non-CSCs. Natural killer (NK) cells are cytotoxic lymphocytes which play a major role in eliminating transformed cells. NK cells not only attack hematologic malignancies and circulating solid tumor cells, but they also appear to have the unique ability to spontaneously recognize and reject allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells. Our laboratory has extensive preliminary data demonstrating that ex vivo activated NK cells can preferentially target CSCs in multiple experimental models, including tumor cell lines, primary tumor samples, and xenograft mouse models. In parallel, we have observed that RT and chemotherapy enrich for CSCs due to preferential targeting of non-CSCs by cytotoxic therapy. In addition, we have shown that RT sensitizes tumor cells, especially CSCs, to NK cell attack and recruitment. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the combination of RT and NK immunotherapy will be more effective than standard anti-proliferative therapy or immunotherapy alone because we will be able to simultaneously target both non-CSCs and CSCs. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following 3 Specific Aims: The first specific aim will determine the mechanism by which NK cells recognize and kill CSCs. This aim will also examine the effects of RT on the sensitization of the CSC to NK killing. Specific Aim 1: To demonstrate that activated NK cells recognize and preferentially attack CSC populations compared with non-CSC in breast, pancreatic, and sarcoma malignancies. We hypothesize that RT debulking of non-CSCs will augment the ability of NK cells to destroy the CSC population resulting in the greatest anti-tumor effects. Our second specific aim will test the efficacy of combination of NK and local RT against xenograft tumor models including both orthotopic breast, pancreatic, and sarcomas and patient-derived xenografts. Specific Aim 2: To demonstrate that RT will improve NK immunotherapy by decreasing tumor bulk, enriching CSCs, sensitizing CSCs to NK attack, and recruiting NK cells to the tumor site. Our third specific aim will utilize the world-class UC Davis Veterinary Cancer Center to establish a clinical trial in canine companion animals. This trial will involve the use o autologous NK cells from canine sarcoma patients in combination with palliative RT or chemotherapy directed towards either primary or metastatic tumors. Specific Aim 3: To demonstrate that NK cell radio-immunotherapy will show local and systemic anti-tumor effects targeting CSCs and non-CSCS with minimal toxicities in canine patients. The aims of this research will elucidate the role of adoptive NK immunotherapy to target CSCs with the goal of translation to meaningful clinical benefit for patients with solid cancers.

TI  - Receptor-targeted radionuclide therapy combined with immunotherapies to improve metastatic melanoma tumor response.
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - Melanoma incidence is rising faster than any other cancer. Surgery can be curative at early stages, butmetastatic melanoma is typically fatal. Responses to new targeted and immunotherapies can be remarkable inselect cases, but low response rates, acquired resistance, and severe adverse side effects (particularly forcombination immunotherapies) limit long-term quality of life for these patients. Thus, despite what is rightlyseen as a revolution in advanced-stage melanoma treatment, the overall response rate to all therapies remainsdismally near 50% and the 5-year survival is <25%. Despite these shortcomings, there is a clear and growingmarket for advanced melanoma drugs (2016 global revenues $4Bln; expected CAGR 15%). Further, receptor-targeted radionuclide therapies are emerging as valuable products in oncology. Two recent acquisitions bylarge pharma: Algeta by Bayer in 2014 ($2.9Bln); and Advanced Accelerator Applications by Novartis in 2017($3.9Bln) highlight this value. Viewpoint identified an initial indication for its MCR1-targeted radionuclidetherapy of progressive stage 4 metastatic melanoma (potential global annual revenues $600Mln). However,emerging evidence suggests a synergistic role for ionizing radiation (IR) combined with immunotherapy topromote immunogenic cancer cell death. Current external beam IR relies on an abscopal effect because IRdelivered in this way can only be directed to individual lesions. Because of known intertumoral heterogeneity ofmelanoma, the advantage of systemic MC1R-RT is precise deposition of radiation in all metastatic lesions,which has the potential to improve the repertoire of neoantigens presented to the immune system. Thus, thereis a critical need to determine the feasibility of safely combining immunotherapies with MC1R-RT for metastaticmelanoma. Proof-of-concept study results support the hypothesis that this combination can expand ourindication to a front-line therapy. The State of Iowa will match $50k upon award for this project.BUSINESS RATIONALE: Success in combining MC1R-RT with immunotherapy to safely improve rates ofoverall and complete response for malignant melanoma potentially expands our indication to a frontlinecombination therapy for all metastatic melanoma patients, which would significantly increase our valuation.AIM 1: Determine the feasibility of safely combining MC1R-RT (90Y) with immunotherapies to improvetumor response rates and survival in two immune-competent mouse melanoma models.IMPACT and SIGNIFICANCE: Successful completion of this Aim will establish the feasibility of safelycombining Viewpoint’s proprietary MCR1-targeted radionuclide therapy with immunotherapies for malignantmelanoma. This work if successful will also establish a robust biochemical and immunological rationale forfurther development of MC1R-RT in clinical trials designed to overcome low response rates, acquiredresistance, and serious side effects that limit current malignant melanoma therapies.

TI  - A narrative review of advances in treatment and survival prognosis of HER2-positive malignant lung cancers
T2  - JOURNAL OF THORACIC DISEASE
M3  - Review
AB  - Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), as a receptor tyrosine kinase of EGF receptor family, whose mutation is often associated with even if less frequency but poor prognosis and shorter survival in pulmonary malignant tumor. HER2 status include mutation, overexpression, amplification and also some rare genotypes, detected by next generation sequencing (NGS), immunohistochemistry (IHC), and also fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Different genotypes represent different therapeutic targets and indicate different clinical prognosis concluded by previous studies. Unfortunately, no standard guidelines for first-line treatment are widely recognized, and current therapeutic schedules include chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy. Especially for patients with advanced metastasis, chemotherapy is based as a systemic therapy using studies of breast cancer or EGFR-positive lung adenocarcinoma as a template. Studies already explored treatment including EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as gefitinib and afatinib, and also trastuzumab and its conjugation like HER2-targeted antibody drug conjugate trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) and conjugate trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd). Also, he researches explored combination therapy with chemotherapy and TKIs or monoclonal antibodies. This review describes commonly used therapies for HER2-positive/HER2-overexpression patients and general relationship between genotypes of HER2, drug selection and final prognosis in order to provide suggestions for future diagnosis and treatment.

TI  - Frequency of weight and body composition increases in advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients during first line therapy
T2  - JOURNAL OF CACHEXIA SARCOPENIA AND MUSCLE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - <bold>Background: </bold>The primary objective of this study was to assess the frequency of body composition increases and their relationships to changes in body weight in two cohorts of real world, treatment-na & iuml;ve, advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. One cohort received the current standard of care (CSOC), which consisted of immunotherapy and newer chemotherapy regimens, and the other cohort was treated with the former standard of care (FSOC), consisting only of older platinum-containing regimens. <bold>Methods: </bold>CSOC (n = 106) and FSOC (n = 88) cohorts of advanced NSCLC patients were included in this study. Weights were collected at each clinical visit, and body composition analysis from routine chest computed tomography via automated segmentation software assessed at baseline and at 6 and 12 weeks. Standard statistical methods were used to calculate relationships between changes in weight and in body composition. <bold>Results: </bold>The CSOC cohort contained 106 stage IV NSCLC patients treated between 16/12/2014 and 22/10/2020 while the FSOC cohort contained 88 stage III/IV NSCLC patients treated between 16/6/2006 and 18/11/2014. While each cohort exhibited decreases in median weight, body mass index (BMI), mean skeletal muscle index (SMI) and subcutaneous adipose tissue index (SATI) at the 6 and 12 week time points, a subset of patients experienced increases in these parameters. Using a threshold of >= 2.5% increase for weight, BMI, SMI, and SATI at the 12 week time point, both cohorts showed similar (20.5% and 27.3%) increases in these parameters. With a cut point of >= 5% increase at 12 weeks follow-up, 8.0% to 25.0% of the patients gained >= 5% in weight, BMI, SMI and SATI. Comparing these results in each cohort showed no significant differences. Pearson coefficients for weight change related to changes in SMI and SATI at 6 and 12 weeks ranged from 0.31 to 0.58 with all P values <0.02. Pearson coefficients for weight change at 12 weeks related to changes in VATI and IMATI ranged from 0.26 to 0.47 with all P values <0.05. Comparison of Pearson coefficients for each cohort showed no significant differences. <bold>Conclusions: </bold>Although decreases in median weight, BMI, SMI and SATI were observed in both cohorts, similar percentage of patients in each cohort experienced increases in these parameters. These findings, plus the positive correlations between longitudinal measurements of weight, muscle mass and adipose tissue, indicate that weight gain in these patients involves increases in both muscle mass and adipose tissue. Upon validation, these findings could have implications for clinical trial design and for translational research in cancer cachexia.

TI  - Impact of Brain Metastases on Treatment Patterns and Outcomes With First-Line Durvalumab Plus Platinum-Etoposide in Extensive-Stage SCLC (CASPIAN): A Brief Report
T2  - JTO CLINICAL AND RESEARCH REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: In the phase 3 study involving the use of durvalumab with or without tremelimumab in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy in untreated extensive -stage SCLC (CASPIAN study), first-line durvalumab plus platinum-etoposide (EP) significantly improved overall survival (OS) versus EP alone (p = 0.0047). We report exploratory subgroup analyses of treatment patterns and outcomes according to the presence of baseline brain or central nervous system metastases.Methods: Patients (WHO performance status 0 or 1), including those with asymptomatic or treated-and-stable brain metastases, were randomized to four cycles of dur-valumab plus EP followed by maintenance durvalumab until progression or up to six cycles of EP and optional prophy-lactic cranial irradiation. Prespecified analyses of OS and progression-free survival (PFS) in subgroups with or without brain metastases used unstratified-Cox proportional hazards models. The data cutoff was on January 27, 2020.Results: At baseline, 28 out of 268 patients (10.4%) in the durvalumab plus EP arm and 27 out of 269 patients (10.0%) in the EP arm had known brain metastases, of whom 3 of 28 (10.7%) and 4 of 27 (14.8%) had previous brain radio-therapy, respectively. Durvalumab plus EP (versus EP alone) prolonged OS (hazard ratio, 95% confidence interval) in patients with (0.79, 0.44-1.41) or without (0.76, 0.62-0.92) brain metastases, with similar PFS results (0.73, 0.42-1.29 and 0.80, 0.66-0.97, respectively). Among patients without brain metastases, similar proportions in each arm developed new brain lesions as part of their first progression (8.8% and 9.5%), although 8.3% in the EP arm received prophy-lactic cranial irradiation. Similar proportions in each arm received subsequent brain radiotherapy (20.5% and 21.2%), although more common in patients with than without baseline brain metastases (45.5% and 18.0%).Conclusions: The OS and PFS benefit with first-line durvalumab plus EP were maintained irrespective of the presence of brain metastases, further supporting its standard-of-care use.(c) 2022 The Authors.

AB  - The microenvironment consists not only of tumor cells but also of physiological tissues which include the stroma with fibroblasts, blood vessels and white blood cells, especially T lymphocytes and macrophages, whose precursors are monocytes deriving from the myeloid lineage. Some tumors have a rich T lymphocyte infiltration. Innate immunity cells such as macrophages, granulocytes and immature myeloid cells from which monocytes or macrophages derive are also found in different densities. To study the evolvement of TIME and the interaction between tumor cells and other immune cells we developed and validated mainly 3 different panels of biomarkers to immuno-stain Formalin fixed paraffin embedded tumor tissue sections using immunofluorescence and opal technique. Each one of these panels included 7 markers. Panel 1 included: CD4, CD8, FOXP3, PDL1, Ki67, CK and Dapi. we use panel1 to phenotypically identify T lymphocytes and their subgroups: T helpers, Cytotoxic T cell, T regulators. Panel 2 included: CD68, CD163, CD56, CD4, CD8 and Dapi. We use panel 2 to identify macrophages and both subtypes, M1 and M2 and their interactions with CD4+ cells and CD8+ cells. Panel 3 included CD11b, CD68, CD14, CD15, CK, HLA-DR and DAPI. We use panel 3 to identify Myeloid derived suppressor cells MDSCs and both subtypes monocyte M-MDSC and Poly-morpho-nuclear PMN-MDSC. Applications and results: Immunotherapy, as a single agent, provides benefit to a small subset of PC patients, which is thought to be partially due to its known cold tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).. Prostvac is a therapeutic cancer vaccine engineered to activate an immune response against prostate-specific Antigen (PSA). Prostvac alone could induce systemic immune response by increasing immune-cell infiltrates in and around the tumor. In our study published in JITC 2020, 27 prostate cancer patients were enrolled in a an open-label, phase II study of neoadjuvant Prostvac vaccine. We evaluated increases in CD4 and CD8 T-cell infiltrates in Radical Prostatectomy (RP) tissue vs baseline biopsies, using our panel 1. We found that for non-compartmentalized analysis (NCA) and compartmentalized analysis (CA), tumor CD4 T-cell infiltrates were significantly increased in postvaccination RP specimens compared with baseline biopsies by NCA . By CA, an increase in both CD4 T-cell infiltrates at the tumor infiltrative margin and in CD8 T-cell infiltrates at the tumor were noted in postvaccination RP specimens compared with baseline biopsies. In a complimentary study, we explored the effect of Prostvac in combination with nivolumab in TIME of prostate cancer. We treated locally advanced prostate cancer patients (n=6) undergoing RP with neoadjuvant Prostvac in combination with nivolumab. Dynamic changes in TIME before and after treatment were studied using multiplex immunofluorescence (Opal Method). FFPE sections from matched pre-treated prostate biopsies and post-treated RP samples were stained with our validated T cell panel1. Combination immunotherapy significantly increased CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells densities in the invasive margin, intratumoral and the benign compartments. 5/6 and 4/6 patients showed more than 2Xincrease of CD4 and CD8 T cells in the TIME, respectively, in at least one of the three compartments, showing more effect that Prostvac alone. Increased proliferative indices in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were also seen after treatment. Tregs were present in low frequencies in TIME (maximum of 12 cells/mm2) with no significant changes. Moreover, a significant drop in tumor cell Ki67 after treatment) suggests that the combination may control tumor growth. The combination of Neoadjuvant Prostvac and nivolumab was associated with increased immune cell infiltration in a cohort of early prostate cancer patients. More patients (10) will be enrolled in this combination study to confirm our finding and that the combined therapy has more benefit than the vaccine alone The Division of Cancer Prevention, NCI sponsored a study of Prostvac vs. Placebo in the active surveillance setting in prostate cancer. In this multicenter study, 154 patients with indolent localized prostate cancer who elected to go on active surveillance, were randomized 2:1 to receive vaccine vs. empty vector placebo. The primary endpoint of the study is immune infiltrate in vaccinated patients vs. placebo patients. We have other ongoing studies that involves clinical trials using bintrafusp alpha on patients with metastatic or locally advanced solid tumors. Expression of both TGF-Beta and PDL1 has been linked with poor prognosis in patients with cancer. Two agents targeting the PD1 / PDL1 pathway have been recently approved by the FDA with impressive duration of responses. Unfortunately, only a fraction of patients develops these responses. M7824 has been shown to have improved activity compared with the parent anti-PDL1 antibody (avelumab), which is now in phase III clinical testing. Bintrafusp alfa (M7824) is a bifunctional fusion protein that targets TGF Beta and PDL1. We have great interest to look at the changes happening in TIME after treatment with bintrafusp alfa. First, we looked at the changes of macrophages densities in non-small lung cancer cohort, and we found that for patients that had progressive disease there was an increase in M2 macrophages and a decrease in M1 macrophages. M1 densities increased in patients that has stable disease, along with T helpers and Cytotoxic T cells. M2 densities decreased in these patients after treatment. The presence of MDSCs in these tumors and their dynamic change is still under investigation. We are investigation the changes in TIME in patients with other cancer types and treated with bintrafusp alfa under protocols 15-C0179 and 18-C0056.We are requesting more tumor samples to have a high number of paired samples with matched pre and post treated samples. in a collaboration with the group of engineers at the Frederick national labs and the Brigham and women's hospital Harvard medical school, we are looking at TIME from spatial distribution angle. We are using our paired samples from patients treated with Bintrafusp alfa to develop a platform that leverage state-of-the-art image analysis techniques to better understand Whole Slide Images (WSI). Multiplex immunofluorescence (MxIF) images are few to 10s of channels that measure the expression of various markers (e.g., CD4, PD-L1, etc.) and therefore are an order of magnitude larger than H&E images. The use of artificial deep neural networks to automatically extract embedded features or patterns helps overcome challenges in traditional MxIF analysis and potentially enables high-level information beyond SA of images. We aim to build on advances in WSI analysis that enable cell-cell interactions to be represented as a graph that can be used as input to dimensionality reduction techniques like autoencoders. Working with a smaller dimension space allows us to use unsupervised clustering and form new groups of the Regions of Interest (ROIs) extracted from the WSI. These groups can suggest new hypotheses that explain the reasons behind the effectiveness of the drug. We will augment and test weakly supervised learning techniques where a single label is provided per WSI to predict the clinical outcome. We will use multiple-instance learning where ROIs with mixed positive and negative signals collectively predict the label of the WSI. Finally, we will utilize recent deep learning techniques like attention to identify important ROIs in the WSIs in making the clinical prediction. This study will push the frontiers of TIME analysis to better understand drug effects and prescribe new promising treatments for patients with cancer.

AB  - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT for Randomized COVID-19 Testing in Vulnerable Communities and Risk Tool CreationThe broad objective of this project is first to perform community-engaged research using randomized COVID-19 testsamong vulnerable populations in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, and then to use innovative empirical methods tomeasure infection rates and progression risk, if infected, from symptomatic infection, to hospitalization, ICU admission,and death. This project is part of the NIH RADx-UP initiative to transform health through research and discovery inCOVID testing among underserved populations. The 2-year project has three specific aims. Aim 1: Use randomized COVIDantibody testing of more than 23,000 persons to measure the population proportion infected with COVID and how thisproportion varies over time and with patient health and demographic characteristics. Twelve partner primary care healthcenters and 150 churches will support community engagement to achieve target enrollments for low-income, minority andelderly populations. These populations will be oversampled to obtain more precise estimates for these high-risk groups. Aim2: Use extensive data linkages to health care data, virus testing data, and mortality records to estimate infection rates andprogression risks as a multivariate function of patient and community characteristics. A web-based risk assessment tool inEnglish and Spanish will be created to allow individuals, families, and health care professionals to assess individual progressionrisk and household transmission risk and to advise individuals on risk mitigation. This risk assessment tool will be informed bythe Milwaukee data and will be of value nationwide. Aim 3: When COVID vaccines become available, the risk assessment toolwill be used to inform the prioritization of vaccination of higher risk individuals. Established trusting relationships withprimary care health centers and churches that serve vulnerable populations, social media outreach, community interestin COVID antibody test results, and easily accessed web-based consents, surveys, and risk assessment tools, as well asCommunity Advisory Board and focus groups input, will foster successful participation in this project. Random samplingmethods will be used to estimate the population proportion infected as a function of demographic and healthcharacteristics accounting for the potential for COVID virus testing, antibody testing, or both, to result in false negativetest results. Population-representative estimates will be adjusted to account for oversampling of elderly, minority, andlow-income populations, and for differences in response rates to the testing offers. To estimate progression risk, thetested population will be used to create a “synthetic” Milwaukee. This synthetic Milwaukee information will becombined with data on deceased patients and hospitalized patients to estimate progression risks. Core empiricalmethods innovations include: 1) estimating the proportion of persons who are antibody negative, and either were notvirus tested or were virus negative, as a function of personal and community characteristics, in order to develop a morecomplete measure of the infection rate; 2) using the tested subsample to create a synthetic Milwaukee which can becombined with actual data on hospitalized and deceased patients to estimate progression risks, and using multipleimputation methods to correctly estimate the uncertainty in defining the synthetic Milwaukee.

AB  - PILOT PROJECT 1: COMBINATION OF VIROIMMUNOTHERAPY AND MICROBIOTA MODULATION TOTREAT GASTRIC CANCERPROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACTGastric cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality, with a 5-year survival rate ofapproximately 20%. The incidence and mortality rates of gastric cancer in the U.S. are of high concern,especially among non-white populations. Hispanic, black non-Hispanic, and Asian/Pacific Islander populationshave a 40-50% higher risk of gastric cancer than white people, and African Americans are nearly twice as likelyto die of stomach cancer. Virotherapy, as a special case of immunotherapy, is showing promising results forsolid tumors in clinical trials. We developed an oncolytic adenovirus, Delta-24-RGD, which was clinically testedin a first-in-human phase I clinical trial in patients with recurrent glioblastoma. Clinical trials and preclinicalstudies showed that the intratumoral injection of Delta-24-RGD triggered an anti-tumor immune response thatinduced complete tumor regression in a small but significant percentage of patients. These clinical dataemphasize the need to develop strategies that will significantly increase the percentage of solid tumors likegastric cancer sensitive to virotherapy. Recent studies showed that the intestinal microbiota influence theefficacy of immunotherapy. These clinical data have been supported by rigorously controlled experimentsusing gnotobiotic mouse models colonized with one or more specific bacteria, which showed that certainmicrobial biomarkers were associated with modulating and enhancing anti-tumor therapies, such as improvingefficacy of immunotherapy. These data suggest that therapeutic interventions aimed at altering the gutmicrobiome may influence the final clinical outcome. Here, we hypothesize that oncolytic adenoviruses willexert an effective anti-cancer effect in gastric cancer, and that the host gut microbiome plays an important rolein modulating the virus-driven anti-tumor response. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following aims:Aim 1. Characterize the anticancer-potency elicited by armed oncolytic adenovirus in gastric cancer. We willutilize the Delta-24-RGD platform of replication-competent, tumor-selective adenoviruses, and the nextgeneration of Delta-24-RGD armed with the immunomodulator OX40L, Delta-24-RGDOX. Aim 2. Examine therole of gut microbial communities in modulating the efficacy of the viroimmunotherapy. We will assess the anti-cancer effect of the oncolytic therapy in relation to different bacterial signatures. This project should yield newinformation about the potential use of oncolytic adenoviruses as therapy for gastric cancer and will openavenues to include intestinal microbiota as a potential treatment modifier, by maximizing the synergy betweenlaboratories at the University of Puerto Rico (UPR) and M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC). Our pilotproject is aligned with the Infection-Driven Malignancies Program for Advancing Careers andTranslational Sciences (IMPACT), in that it will allow us to generate preliminary data with potential to betranslated into a full project to address a public health problem among the Hispanic population.

AB  - My research work largely explores the underlying physiologic questions regarding tiny vesicles calledexosomes. These exosomes are released from many different types of cells or food-derived exosome-likenanoparticles and I am investigating in VA patients the promising role of exosomes as therapeutic vehicles indelivering treatment for a diverse but specific group of medical conditions, i.e.,obesity/diabetes, Nonalcoholicfatty liver disease (NASH), and cancer. There is a substantial population of veterans who are obese and/orhave cancer. Obesity and cancer pose special burdens on veterans who depend on VA care. Obesitycontributes to over 300,000 deaths per year and increases the risk of NASH, type 2 diabetes, and severalcancers including colon, prostate, and kidney. Since receiving my initial Research Career Scientist award, myresearch group has published more than 50 manuscripts on this subject. Collectively, our findings supportcontinued funding of my team to investigate the following 3 aims: (1) Tumor exosomes play a role in: (a)immunosuppression through induction of myeloid-derived suppressor cells, inhibition of dendritic celldifferentiation, and inhibition of activation of NK cell immunotherapy; (b) by sorting suppressor miRNAs fromtumor cells into exosomes based on the oncogenic major vault protein (MVP), tumors grow faster (NatureCommunications. 2017 Feb 17;8:14448, Nature communications. 2015;6:6956); and (c) more recently, wediscovered a novel nanoparticle (Oncotarget. 2016 May 12). Unlike other EVs, this extracellular nanovesicle(named HG-NV, HG-NV stands for HomoGenous nanovesicle as well as for Huang-Ge- nanovesicle) releasedfrom both mouse and human breast tumor cells is enriched with RNAs. Tumor-derived HG-NVs are morepotent in promoting tumor progression than exosomes. Molecules predominantly present in breast tumor HG-NVs have been identified and characterized. This discovery may have implications in advancing bothmicrovesicle biology research and clinical management including potential useas a biomarker, (2). Exosomesreleased from non-tumor cells play a role in: (a) adipose tissue exosome-like vesicles mediating activation ofmacrophage-induced insulin resistance (Diabetes. 2009 Nov;58(11):2498-505); (b) we also found thatintestinal mucus-derived exosomes mediate activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling and play a role in inductionof liver NKT cell anergy (Hepatology, 2013 57(3):1250-61); and (c) intestinal mucus‐derived exosomes carryprostaglandin E2 and suppress activation of liver NKT cells (J Immunol, 2013, 190(7):3579-89); (3). Exosome-like nanoparticles from edible plants have an effect and therapeutic application on mammalian cells: (a) weused mouse models to show that interspecies communication between plant and mouse gut host cells throughedible plant derived exosome‐like nanoparticles by inducing expression of genes for anti-inflammationcytokines, antioxidation, and activation of Wnt signaling, which are crucial for maintaining intestinalhomeostasis. This finding not only opens up a new avenue for investigating ELNs as a means to protect againstthe development of liver related diseases such as alcohol induced liver damage, but sheds light on studyingthe cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying inter-species communication in the liver via edible plant-derived nanoparticles; (b) targeted drug/therapeutic miRNAs (Nature Communications. 2013;4:1867) deliveryto intestinal macrophages, brain microglia cells (Molecular therapy: 2015, Volume 24, Issue 1, p96–105) andinflammatory tumor sites (Cancer Research, 2015;75:2520-9) by grapefruit ELN is possible; (c) Broccoli-Derived Nanoparticle Inhibits Mouse Colitis by Activating Dendritic Cell AMP-Activated Protein Kinase(Molecular Therapy. 2017, in press); and (d) Grape exosome-like nanoparticles induce intestinal stem cellsand protect mice from DSS-induced colitis (Molecular Therapy. 2013 Jul;21(7):1345-57).

These exosomes are released from many different types of cells or food-derived exosome-likenanoparticles and I am investigating in VA patients the promising role of exosomes as therapeutic vehicles indelivering treatment for a diverse but specific group of medical conditions, i.e.,obesity/diabetes, Nonalcoholicfatty liver disease (NASH), and cancer. There is a substantial population of veterans who are obese and/orhave cancer. Obesity and cancer pose special burdens on veterans who depend on VA care. Obesitycontributes to over 300,000 deaths per year and increases the risk of NASH, type 2 diabetes, and severalcancers including colon, prostate, and kidney. Since receiving my initial Research Career Scientist award, myresearch group has published more than 50 manuscripts on this subject. Collectively, our findings supportcontinued funding of my team to investigate the following 3 aims: (1) Tumor exosomes play a role in: (a)immunosuppression through induction of myeloid-derived suppressor cells, inhibition of dendritic celldifferentiation, and inhibition of activation of NK cell immunotherapy; (b) by sorting suppressor miRNAs fromtumor cells into exosomes based on the oncogenic major vault protein (MVP), tumors grow faster (NatureCommunications. 2017 Feb 17;8:14448, Nature communications. 2015;6:6956); and (c) more recently, wediscovered a novel nanoparticle (Oncotarget. 2016 May 12). Unlike other EVs, this extracellular nanovesicle(named HG-NV, HG-NV stands for HomoGenous nanovesicle as well as for Huang-Ge- nanovesicle) releasedfrom both mouse and human breast tumor cells is enriched with RNAs. Tumor-derived HG-NVs are morepotent in promoting tumor progression than exosomes. Molecules predominantly present in breast tumor HG-NVs have been identified and characterized. This discovery may have implications in advancing bothmicrovesicle biology research and clinical management including potential useas a biomarker, (2). Exosomesreleased from non-tumor cells play a role in: (a) adipose tissue exosome-like vesicles mediating activation ofmacrophage-induced insulin resistance (Diabetes. 2009 Nov;58(11):2498-505); (b) we also found thatintestinal mucus-derived exosomes mediate activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling and play a role in inductionof liver NKT cell anergy (Hepatology, 2013 57(3):1250-61); and (c) intestinal mucus‐derived exosomes carryprostaglandin E2 and suppress activation of liver NKT cells (J Immunol, 2013, 190(7):3579-89); (3). Exosome-like nanoparticles from edible plants have an effect and therapeutic application on mammalian cells: (a) weused mouse models to show that interspecies communication between plant and mouse gut host cells throughedible plant derived exosome‐like nanoparticles by inducing expression of genes for anti-inflammationcytokines, antioxidation, and activation of Wnt signaling, which are crucial for maintaining intestinalhomeostasis. This finding not only opens up a new avenue for investigating ELNs as a means to protect againstthe development of liver related diseases such as alcohol induced liver damage, but sheds light on studyingthe cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying inter-species communication in the liver via edible plant-derived nanoparticles; (b) targeted drug/therapeutic miRNAs (Nature Communications. 2013;4:1867) deliveryto intestinal macrophages, brain microglia cells (Molecular therapy: 2015, Volume 24, Issue 1, p96–105) andinflammatory tumor sites (Cancer Research, 2015;75:2520-9) by grapefruit ELN is possible; (c) Broccoli-Derived Nanoparticle Inhibits Mouse Colitis by Activating Dendritic Cell AMP-Activated Protein Kinase(Molecular Therapy. 2017, in press); and (d) Grape exosome-like nanoparticles induce intestinal stem cellsand protect mice from DSS-induced colitis (Molecular Therapy. 2013 Jul;21(7):1345-57).

TI  - Next generation T cell therapies for mutant KRAS solid tumors
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - Project SummaryThis proposal “Next generation T cell therapies for KRAS mutated solid tumors” was developed in response toRFA-CA-22-028 and to fulfill the Cancer Adoptive Cellular Therapy Network (Can-ACT) objectives. The focus ofour proposal is targeting mutant KRAS, a clonal driver oncoprotein, by the early-stage clinical testing ofTCR1020, a T cell receptor specific for mKRAS G12V restricted to HLA-A*11:01. If successful, this novel-state-of-the-art Adoptive Cell Therapy (ACT) could be available to ~5,000 new solid tumor patients per year in the US.Advances in gene editing together with new insights related to mechanisms of T cell exhaustion provide thescientific basis for development of the next generation T cell therapies in solid tumors. Our central hypothesisis that targeting mutant KRAS through the action of TCR1020-T cells, engineered to overcome cell intrinsicmechanisms of exhaustion and counteract a cell extrinsic myeloid checkpoint to overcome TME resistance, willpromote durable tumor regression in solid tumors. There are three hypothesis-driven specific Aims in thisproposal. In Aim 1, we will develop genetically modified T cells expressing TCR1020 targeting mKRASG12V/HLA-A*11:01 to overcome extrinsic and intrinsic mechanisms of resistance. In Aim 2, we plan to evaluateTCR1020-T CD4+ cells to improve the persistence and potency of mKRAS specific CD8+ effector cells. In Aim3, the safety and clinical activity of engineered TCR1020-T cell products will be determined in a dose escalationmulti-site phase 1 study. We have assembled an exceptional group of investigators with an extensive trackrecord of collaboration and productivity with expertise in human immunology, immuno-oncology, cell therapy, Tcell engineering and gene editing. Additionally, experts in molecular pathology and biomarker discovery willcontribute to cutting-edge correlative studies to aid in biomarker development and TME characterization todelineate potential mechanisms of response and resistance. The Center for Cellular Immunotherapies (CCI) atthe University of Pennsylvania has extensive expertise in the development of ACT therapies producing morethan 2,500 cell products for administration to adult and pediatric patients. CCI has a long track record oftechnology transfer related to cell therapies to both large pharmaceutical companies (Novartis, Kymriah) andbiotechnology companies over the past decade. As a multi-site trial application, an important programmaticcomponent of our proposal is to leverage NCI resources thru utilization of the Immune Cell Network (ICN) Coreat FNLCR to manufacture, test, release and distribute the engineered TCR1020-T cell products. In summary,our proposal incorporates multiple scientific and technological innovations that targets a recurrent clonal driveroncoprotein with engineered T cells modified to resist T cell exhaustion and overcome the immunosuppressiveTME.

TI  - Synthetic Studies Related to Cancer Research/Treatment
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - ﻿   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This renewal involves integrated and interdependent synthetic, mechanistic, structural, biochemical mode of action, computer modeling, collaborative and preclinical studies directed at the design, synthesis and advancement of fundamentally new and unique therapeutic leads and strategies directed at unsolved global human health problems: the eradication of HIV/AIDS, the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, and small molecule enhanced cancer immunotherapy. HIV is one of the most catastrophic pandemics to confront mankind. Current antiretroviral therapy (ART) addresses the active virus, allowing one to live with AIDS, but with cost, compliance, resistance and chronic chemo exposure challenges. ART is not curative. Reservoir cells incorporating genomically encoded provirus episodically resupply the active virus. Elimination of these reservoir cells if done with ART is thus one of the most promising strategies to eradicate HIV/AIDS. Modulation of protein kinase C (PKC) represents one of the best strategies to eliminate reservoir cells. PKC modulators are also implicated in cancer (in clinical trials), Alzheimer's disease (in clinical trials), and many other unmet therapeutic needs. The lead PKC modulator, bryostatin 1, is now in the clinic for AIDS eradication, Alzheimer's disease and cancer. It supply is nearly, if not, exhausted. A plan is provided to address the supply problem through the scalable synthesis of bryostatin 1. At the same time, plans are proposed to use combined experimental (REDOR and DNP solid state NMR) and computational approaches to produce the first structural and dynamic analysis of PKC-bryostatin analog complexes in a membrane environment. This first-of-its-kind integrated synthesis/solid state NMR/computational approach will allow us to understand at a molecular level the binding of current PKC modulators to the PKC regulatory domain. That information will then inform the design of new PKC modulators. Our current bryostatin analogs (bryologs) are superior to bryostatin in all studies conducted thus far including binding, cell, animal and ex viv studies on primary cells from patients. Our newest bryologs exhibit unprecedented PKC selectivities. These and new analogs will be advanced through a comprehensive series of assays conducted by us and our collaborators. The resulting bryologs represent preclinical leads proving thus far to be superior to bryostatin and because of their simplified structure are significantly more synthetically accessible than bryostatin.

AB  - PILOT PROJECT 1: COMBINATION OF VIROIMMUNOTHERAPY AND MICROBIOTA MODULATION TOTREAT GASTRIC CANCERPROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACTGastric cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality, with a 5-year survival rate ofapproximately 20%. The incidence and mortality rates of gastric cancer in the U.S. are of high concern,especially among non-white populations. Hispanic, black non-Hispanic, and Asian/Pacific Islander populationshave a 40-50% higher risk of gastric cancer than white people, and African Americans are nearly twice as likelyto die of stomach cancer. Virotherapy, as a special case of immunotherapy, is showing promising results forsolid tumors in clinical trials. We developed an oncolytic adenovirus, Delta-24-RGD, which was clinically testedin a first-in-human phase I clinical trial in patients with recurrent glioblastoma. Clinical trials and preclinicalstudies showed that the intratumoral injection of Delta-24-RGD triggered an anti-tumor immune response thatinduced complete tumor regression in a small but significant percentage of patients. These clinical dataemphasize the need to develop strategies that will significantly increase the percentage of solid tumors likegastric cancer sensitive to virotherapy. Recent studies showed that the intestinal microbiota influence theefficacy of immunotherapy. These clinical data have been supported by rigorously controlled experimentsusing gnotobiotic mouse models colonized with one or more specific bacteria, which showed that certainmicrobial biomarkers were associated with modulating and enhancing anti-tumor therapies, such as improvingefficacy of immunotherapy. These data suggest that therapeutic interventions aimed at altering the gutmicrobiome may influence the final clinical outcome. Here, we hypothesize that oncolytic adenoviruses willexert an effective anti-cancer effect in gastric cancer, and that the host gut microbiome plays an important rolein modulating the virus-driven anti-tumor response. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following aims:Aim 1. Characterize the anticancer-potency elicited by armed oncolytic adenovirus in gastric cancer. We willutilize the Delta-24-RGD platform of replication-competent, tumor-selective adenoviruses, and the nextgeneration of Delta-24-RGD armed with the immunomodulator OX40L, Delta-24-RGDOX. Aim 2. Examine therole of gut microbial communities in modulating the efficacy of the viroimmunotherapy. We will assess the anti-cancer effect of the oncolytic therapy in relation to different bacterial signatures. This project should yield newinformation about the potential use of oncolytic adenoviruses as therapy for gastric cancer and will openavenues to include intestinal microbiota as a potential treatment modifier, by maximizing the synergy betweenlaboratories at the University of Puerto Rico (UPR) and M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC). Our pilotproject is aligned with the Infection-Driven Malignancies Program for Advancing Careers andTranslational Sciences (IMPACT), in that it will allow us to generate preliminary data with potential to betranslated into a full project to address a public health problem among the Hispanic population.
