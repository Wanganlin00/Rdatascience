	abstract = {Background: This phase II prospective trial aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of adebrelimab (PD-L1 antibody) plus first-line chemotherapy followed by sequential thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) combined with adebrelimab in extensive-stage small–cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). Biomarkers associated with potential therapeutic effects were also explored. Methods: Patients with previously untreated ES-SCLC were enrolled at Shandong Cancer Hospital and Institute (Jinan, China). Patients received 4–6 cycles of adebrelimab (20 mg/kg, D1, Q3W) combined with EP/EC (etoposide, 100 mg/m2, D1-3, Q3W and cisplatin, 75 mg/m2, D1, Q3W or carboplatin, AUC = 5, D1, Q3W). Then patients with response sequentially underwent consolidative TRT (≥30 Gy in 10 fractions or ≥50 Gy in 25 fractions, involved-field irradiation), and maintenance adebrelimab until disease progression or intolerable adverse events (AEs). The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Genomic and circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) profiling were also analyzed with tumour tissues and peripheral blood. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04562337. Findings: From October 2020 to April 2023, 67 patients diagnosed with ES-SCLC were enrolled and received at least one dose of study treatment. All patients were included in the efficacy and safety analyses. 45 patients received sequential TRT as planned. The median OS and progression-free survival (PFS) was 21.4 months (95% CI: 17.2–not reached months) and 10.1 months (95% CI: 6.9–15.5 months), respectively. The confirmed objective response rate was 71.6% (48/67, 95% CI: 59.3–82.0%) and disease control rate was 89.6% (60/67, 95% CI: 79.7–95.7%). There were no treatment-related deaths. The most common grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were hematological toxicities. The incidence of any grade and G3+ pneumonitis was 25% (17/67) and 6% (4/67), respectively. No unexpected adverse events were observed. Patients without co-mutations of TP53/RB1 in both tissue and peripheral blood displayed longer PFS (tissue, P = 0.071; ctDNA, P = 0.060) and OS (tissue, P = 0.032; ctDNA, P = 0.031). Interpretation: Adebrelimab plus chemotherapy and sequential TRT as first-line therapy for ES-SCLC showed promising efficacy and acceptable safety.

	abstract = {Objective: Increasing studies have highlighted the potential utility of non-invasive prognostic biomarkers in advanced lung cancer patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) based anti-cancer therapies. Here, a novel prognostic predictor named as C-PLAN integrating C-reactive protein (CRP), Performance status (PS), Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), Albumin (ALB), and derived Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (dNLR) was identified and validated in a single-center retrospective cohort. Methods: The clinical data of 192 ICI-treated lung cancer patients was retrospectively analyzed. The pretreatment levels of CRP, PS, LDH, ALB and dNLR were scored respectively and then their scores were added up to form C-PLAN index. The correlation of C-PLAN index with the progression-free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS) was analyzed by a Kaplan–Meier model. The multivariate analysis was used to identify whether C-PLAN index was an independent prognostic predictor. Results: A total of 88 and 104 patients were included in the low and high C-PLAN index group respectively. High C-PLAN index was significantly correlated with worse PFS and OS in ICI-treated lung cancer patients (both p<0.001). The multivariate analysis revealed high C-PLAN index was an independent unfavorable factor affecting PFS (hazard ratio (HR)=1.821; 95%confidence interval (CI)=1.291-2.568) and OS (HR=2.058, 95%CI=1.431-2.959). The high C-PLAN index group had a significantly lower disease control rate than the low C-PLAN index group (p=0.024), while no significant difference was found for objective response rate (p=0.172). The subgroup analysis based on clinical features (pathological type, therapy strategy, TNM stage and age) confirmed the prognostic value of C-PLAN index, except for patients receiving ICI monotherapy or with age ranging from 18 to 65 years old. Finally, a nomogram was constructed based on C-PLAN index, age, gender, TNM stage and smoking status, which could predict well the 1-, 2- and 3-year survival of ICI-treated lung cancer patients. Conclusion: The C-PLAN index has great potential to be utilized as a non-invasive, inexpensive and reliable prognostic predictor for advanced lung cancer patients receiving ICI-based anti-cancer therapies.

	abstract = {Immunosuppressants are increasingly being used in the clinic to manage immune-related adverse effects. Consequently, the incidence of secondary infections associated with immunosuppression is increasing. However, little is known about primary infections during immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment without immunosuppressants. We aimed to evaluate primary infectious diseases during antiprogrammed death ligand-1 immunotherapy without immunosuppressants. We retrospectively screened medical records of 233 patients who underwent ICI treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer between January 2014 and May 2018 at National Cancer Center, Republic of Korea. Subsequently, we evaluated the clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of selected patients hospitalized for potential infectious disease without immunosuppressive treatment (n=80). Eight cases (3.4%) were identified as bacterial pneumonia (n=5) and cellulitis, inflamed epidermoid cyst, and wound infection (n=1 each). The bacterial pathogens Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were identified in 4 patients with pneumonia. The period between the start of ICI treatment and infection varied between 3 and 189 days (median, 24.5 days). Five (62.5%) patients were infected within a month after ICI treatment initiation. All patients were treated with empirical antibiotics and discharged without complications. The median progression-free and overall survival for ICI treatment was 11.5 and 25.5 months, respectively. Six patients experienced ICI-associated adverse effects postinfection: Herpes zoster infection (n=4) and pneumonitis (n=2). Infectious disease independent of immunosuppression is a rare, but possible event in patients with lung cancer receiving ICI treatment. Clinical awareness would enable prompt diagnosis of primary infection during immunotherapy. © 2024 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins. All rights reserved.},

This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of paclitaxel liposome based chemotherapy plus PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor in patients with advanced NSCLC. Methods: In this multicenter, retrospective, real-world study, patients with advanced NSCLC who were administered paclitaxel liposome based chemotherapy plus PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor in three centers (Peking University People’s Hospital as the lead center) in China between 2016 and 2022 were included. Progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), objective response rate, disease control rate, and adverse events (AEs) were evaluated. Results: A total of 49 patients were included, with 33 (67.3%) receiving paclitaxel liposome based chemotherapy plus PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor as first-line treatment. There were 34 patients (69.4%) diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma and 15 (30.6%) with adenocarcinoma. The median follow-up was 20.5 (range: 3.1–41.1) months. The median PFS and OS of all patients were 9.7 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.0-12.4) and 30.5 months (95% CI, not evaluable-not evaluable), respectively. Patients with squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma had median PFS of 11 months (95%CI, 6.5–15.5) and 9.3 months (95%CI, 7.0-12.4), respectively. The median PFS was 9.9 months (95%CI, 7.1–12.7) in patients who received the combined regimen as first-line treatment. Treatment-related AEs of any grade were observed in 25 (51.0%) patients, and AEs of grade 3 or worse were observed in nine patients (18.4%). The most common treatment-related AEs were myelosuppression (14.3%) and fever (10.2%). Conclusions: Paclitaxel liposome based chemotherapy plus PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor prolonged the PFS in advanced NSCLC with acceptable safety, which was worthy of clinical application. © 2024, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background and Objective: Palliative radiotherapy (RT) and systemic immuno- or targeted therapy both play significant roles in the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Concurrent application of these therapies is increasing, however, no guidelines exist regarding the combination of systemic therapy with RT. This narrative review summarises the existing literature reporting toxicity observed after concurrent treatment with RT and immuno- or targeted therapeutic agents commonly used in HCC. Methods: The PubMed database was searched for studies published between 2011 and 2023 reporting toxicity data on patients treated concurrently with RT and targeted agents used in HCC. Due to the paucity of relevant literature in HCC, the inclusion criteria were expanded to include non-HCC cohorts treated with targeted therapies commonly used in advanced HCC. Key Content and Findings: Sixty-seven articles were included in this review. Twenty-two articles reported combined RT with sorafenib, one with regorafenib, 22 with bevacizumab, three with lenvatinib and 19 with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Significant findings include a high rate severe hepatotoxicity with combination RT and sorafenib, ranging from 0–19% with liver stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) and 3–18% with conventionally fractionated liver RT. Severe gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities including perforation and ulceration were seen with combination bevacizumab and RT, ranging from 0–27% in the acute setting and 0–23% in the late setting. The safety profile of combination immune checkpoint blockade agents and RT was similar to that seen in monotherapy. Conclusions: Existing data suggests that combination RT and targeted therapy given the risk of severe adverse events including hepatotoxicity and GI toxicity. There is an urgent need for future studies specifically examining the impact of combination therapy in HCC patients to guide clinical decision-making in the evolving landscape of immune- and targeted therapies. © Chinese Clinical Oncology.

	abstract = {Introduction: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma responsible for 200,000 deaths per year worldwide. Platinum-etoposide-based chemotherapy has been the standard of treatment for the past 40 years, with an overall survival of 10 months. Since 2019, the addition of immunotherapy (atezolizumab or durvalumab) to chemotherapy has become the standard of care for first-line treatment of extensive-stage SCLC following the demonstration of an improvement in overall survival in phase 3 studies. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of chemo-immunotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone in a “real-world” setting. Methods: Retrospective observational study including patients undergoing first-line treatment for extensive-stage SCLC between 2014 and 2022. We separated the study population into two arms (chemo-immunotherapy/chemotherapy). For each arm, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and serious side effects were collected. Associations between treatments and survival outcomes were adjusted for potential confounders. Consolidative palliative thoracic radiotherapy was introduced in the models as a time-dependent variable. Results: A total of 118 patients with a median age of 63 years were included. 65.2 % of patients were performance status 0 or 1. In univariate analysis, PFS and OS were not significantly different between the chemo-immunotherapy and chemotherapy alone groups (p = 0.70 and 0.24 respectively). In multivariate analysis, the addition of immunotherapy to chemotherapy was not significantly associated with better PFS (HR 0.76, IC (0.49 – 1.19), p = 0.23), but it was significantly associated with better OS (HR 0.61, IC (0.38 – 0.98), p = 0.04). Consolidative palliative thoracic radiotherapy (time-dependent variable), when applied (almost only in the chemotherapy alone group), was significantly associated with better PFS and OS. Discussion: In this real-world study, chemo-immunotherapy was associated with slightly better OS compared to chemotherapy alone as a first-line treatment in ES-SCLC patients in multivariate analysis, which is not explained by a benefit in PFS. However, consolidative palliative thoracic radiotherapy seems to be significantly associated with better OS and PFS, suggesting that we should also consider using it in patients receiving chemo-immunotherapy. © 2024 The Author(s)},

However, clinical trials suggest differential efficacy of anti-PD-1 agents and anti-PD-L1 agents in first-line treatment of ES-SCLC. This retrospective multicenter study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of anti-PD-1 agents versus anti-PD-L1 agents in first-line treatment of ES-SCLC in real-world practice. Methods: Patients with pathologically or cytologically confirmed ES-SCLC treated with platinum plus etoposide combined with anti-PD-1 or PD-L1 agents as first-line treatment in different centers of PLA General Hospital between January 2017 and October 2021 were included for this study. Survival outcomes and safety were compared between patients receiving anti-PD-1 and PD-L1 agents. Results: Of the total 154 included patients, 68 received anti-PD-1 agents plus chemotherapy (PD-1 group), and 86 received anti-PD-L1 agents plus chemotherapy (PD-L1 group). Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in the entire cohort were 7.6 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.5–8.2 months) and 17.4 months (95% CI: 15.3–19.3 months), respectively. Median PFS and OS were comparable between the PD-1 group and PD-L1 group (PFS: 7.6 months vs. 8.3 months, HR = 1.13, 95% CI: 0.79–1.62, p = 0.415; OS: 26.9 months vs. 25.6 months, HR = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.63–1.47, p = 0.859. The objective response rate and disease control rate were comparable between the two groups: 79.4% vs. 79.1% and 92.6% vs. 94.2%, respectively. The 6-month, 12-month, and 18-month PFS and OS rates were slightly higher in the PD-L1 group than in the PD-1 group, while the 24-month PFS rate was slightly higher in the PD-1 group than in the PD-L1 group. Stratified analysis showed that locoregional thoracic radiotherapy and normal lactate dehydrogenase level were independent predictors of better OS in ES-SCLC patients treated with first-line chemotherapy plus ICI. Adverse events were not significantly different between the two groups. Conclusions: Anti-PD-1 agents and anti-PD-L1 agents combined with chemotherapy as first-line treatment for ES-SCLC are comparably effective and well tolerated. © 2024, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: Numerous studies have demonstrated that brain metastases patients may benefit from intracranial radiotherapy combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). However, it is unclear whether this treatment is effective for patients with small cell lung cancer brain metastases (SCLC-BMs). Methods: We conducted a retrospective study by analyzing medical records of patients with SCLC-BMs from January 1, 2017 to June 1, 2022. Data related to median overall survival (mOS), median progression-free survival (mPFS), and intracranial progression-free survival (iPFS) were analyzed. Results: A total of 109 patients were enrolled, of which 60 received WBRT and 49 received WBRT-ICI. Compared to the WBRT alone cohort, the WBRT-ICI cohort showed longer mOS (20.4 months vs. 29.3 months, p = 0.021), mPFS (7.9 months vs. 15.1 months, p < 0.001), and iPFS (8.3 months vs. 16.5 months, p < 0.001). Furthermore, WBRT-ICI cohort had a better response rate for both BMs. (p = 0.035) and extracranial diseases (p < 0.001) compared to those receiving WBRT alone. Notably, the use of WBRT before ICI was associated with longer mOS compared to the use of WBRT after ICI (23.3 months for the ICI-WBRT group vs. 34.8 months for the WBRT-ICI group, p = 0.020). Conclusion: Our results indicated that WBRT combined with immunotherapy improved survival in SCLC-BMs patients compared to WBRT monotherapy. Administering WBRT prior to ICI treatment is associated with improved survival outcomes compared to WBRT following ICI treatment, for patients with SCLC-BMs. These findings highlight the significance of conducting further prospective researches on combination strategies of intracranial radiotherapy and ICI in SCLC-BMs patients. © 2024 The Authors.

	abstract = {Background: The therapeutic advantage of thoracic radiotherapy (tRT) as an adjunct to first-line immunotherapy and chemotherapy in patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) remains unclear. We sought to elucidate this in a retrospective cohort study comparing the effectiveness and safety of tRT in combination with first-line immunotherapy and chemotherapy. Methods: Our retrospective study included patients with ES-SCLC, treated at the West China Hospital between January 2019 and December 2022. They received first-line immunotherapy and chemotherapy and were categorized into two cohorts based on the administration of tRT. The primary outcomes were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Cox regression analysis was utilized to identify potential independent predictors of prognosis and to compare the treatment outcomes across various patient subgroups. Treatment-related toxicities across both cohorts were compared using the Chi-squared test. Results: A total of 99patients were eligible for the study, out of which 55 received tRT. The medianduration of follow-up was 39 months. Remarkably, patients who received tRTdemonstrated superior OS and PFS in comparison to those who did not (P < 0.05). Subgroup analysis further confirmed these findings. Multivariate analysisidentified treatment group and liver metastasis as independent prognosticfactors (P < 0.05). The incidence of grade 3-4 adverse events showed nostatistically significant difference between the two cohorts. Conclusions: Thus, weconfirmed that the addition of tRT to the conventional regimen of first-linechemotherapy and immunotherapy yields better survival outcomes without asignificant increase in toxicity. © 2024 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Introduction: Adjuvant immunotherapy (IO) following concurrent chemotherapy and photon radiation therapy confers an overall survival (OS) benefit for patients with inoperable locally advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma (LA-NSCLC); however, outcomes of adjuvant IO after concurrent chemotherapy with proton beam therapy (CPBT) are unknown. We investigated OS and toxicity after CPBT with adjuvant IO versus CPBT alone for inoperable LA-NSCLC. Materials and methods: We analyzed 354 patients with LA-NSCLC who were prospectively treated with CPBT with or without adjuvant IO from 2009 to 2021. Optimal variable ratio propensity score matching (PSM) matched CPBT with CPBT + IO patients. Survival was estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with log-rank tests. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression evaluated the effect of IO on disease outcomes. Results: Median age was 70 years; 71 (20%) received CPBT + IO and 283 (80%) received CPBT only. After PSM, 71 CPBT patients were matched with 71 CPBT + IO patients. Three-year survival rates for CPBT + IO vs CPBT were: OS 67% vs 30% (P < 0.001) and PFS 59% vs 35% (P = 0.017). Three-year LRFS (P = 0.137) and DMFS (P = 0.086) did not differ. Receipt of adjuvant IO was a strong predictor of OS (HR 0.40, P = 0.001) and PFS (HR 0.56, P = 0.030), but not LRFS (HR 0.61, P = 0.121) or DMFS (HR 0.61, P = 0.136). There was an increased incidence of grade ≥3 esophagitis in the CPBT-only group (6% CPBT + IO vs 17% CPBT, P = 0.037). Conclusion: This study, one of the first to investigate CPBT followed by IO for inoperable LA-NSCLC, showed that IO conferred survival benefits with no increased rates of toxicity. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Background: The use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) for the treatment of lung cancer may precipitate cardiotoxic events. We aimed to perform a meta-analysis to evaluate the cardiotoxicity associated with ICIs in patients with lung cancer. Methods: A literature search was conducted across four electronic databases (Cochrane CENTRAL, MEDLINE, OVID EMBASE and Google Scholar) from inception through 31st May 2023. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the impact of ICIs on cardiac outcomes in lung cancer patients were considered for inclusion. Risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled and analysis was performed using a random-effects model. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach was followed to assess confidence in the estimates of effect (i.e., the quality of evidence). Results: A total of 30 studies including 16,331 patients, were included in the analysis. Pooled results showed that single ICI (RR: 2.15; 95% CI: 1.13–4.12; p = 0.02; I2 = 0%) or a combination of single ICI plus chemotherapy (RR: 1.38 [1.05–1.82]; p = 0.02) significantly increased the risk of cardiac adverse events when compared with chemotherapy alone. No significant difference was noted when a dual ICI (RR: 0.48 [0.13–1.80]; p = 0.27) was compared with single ICI. In addition, there was no significant association between the use of ICIs and incidence of cardiac failure (RR: 1.11 [0.48–2.58]; p = 0.80), or arrhythmia (RR: 1.87; [0.69–5.08]; p = 0.22). Conclusion: Compared with chemotherapy alone, use of a single ICI or a combination of single ICI plus chemotherapy significantly increased the risk of cardiotoxicity. However, employing dual immunotherapy did not result in a significant increase in the risk of cardiotoxicity when compared to the use of a single ICI. © The Author(s) 2024.},

Traditional treatments provide fewer benefits to PSC patients and are associated with early recurrence and metastasis. Surgical intervention is the preferred option for early-stage PSC patients, whereas chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, and other targeted therapies are recommended for advanced PSC patients. Targeted therapy is only effective in a small number of PSC patients. The initial efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors has been acceptable in patients with advanced PSC; therefore, much attention on related biomarkers has been sought.

	abstract = {Background: Immune checkpoint inhibitor combined with platinum-etoposide is the standard first-line therapy for patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). The phase 3 clinical trials that led to the approval of chemoimmunotherapy in ES-SCLC excluded patients who had an Eastern Cooperative Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 2–3. Therefore, data on the efficacy of chemoimmunotherapy in patients with an ECOG PS of 2–3 are limited. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on patients diagnosed with ES-SCLC who received chemoimmunotherapy (atezolizumab or durvalumab) within the Mayo Clinic Health System between January 2016 and January 2021. The objective of this study was to compare the overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and best clinical response to therapy in patients with an ECOG PS of 0–1 vs. patients with an ECOG PS of 2–3 who received chemoimmunotherapy for newly diagnosed ES-SCLC. Results: In total, 82 patients were included in the study. The mean ± standard deviation age was 68.1 ± 8.3 years. Of these, 56 patients were identified with an ECOG PS of 0–1, and 26 patients were identified with an ECOG PS of 2–3. The median PFS was similar regardless of ECOG PS (5.8 months [95% CI, 4.3–6.0 months] in the ECOG PS 0–1 group vs. 4.1 months [95% CI, 3.8–6.9 months] in the ECOG PS 2–3; p =.2994). The median OS was also similar regardless of ECOG PS (10.6 months [95% CI, 8.4–13.4 months] in the ECOG PS 0–1 group vs. 9.3 months [95% CI, 4.9–12.8 months]; p =.2718) in the ECOG PS 2-3 group. Conclusions: The study results demonstrated no significant difference in PFS or OS among the ECOG PS 2–3 and ECOG PS 0–1 groups. Therefore, chemoimmunotherapy should be considered for patients who have ES-SCLC with an ECOG PS of 2–3. © 2023 American Cancer Society.},

	abstract = {Background: Driver gene-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients are prone to develop leptomeningeal metastasis (LM), leading to an extremely high mortality. The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) treatments for patients with NSCLC and LM harboring targetable mutations. Methods: We retrospectively collected records of patients with NSCLC harboring targetable mutations and prescribed ICIs following the diagnosis of LM at Huashan Hospital, Fudan University. In addition, we reviewed relevant literature and enrolled patients who met the inclusion criteria. Clinical characteristics were statistically analyzed, and the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test were employed to assess the median progression-free survival (mPFS) and median overall survival (mOS). Results: A total of 37 patients with NSCLC harboring targetable mutations who received ICIs after LM diagnosis were included. The median age of the enrolled patients was 54 years (range, 33–70 years), and 62.2% were female. Following ICI administration, the intracranial objective response rate (iORR) and intracranial disease control rate (iDCR) for all enrolled patients were 18.9% and 62.2%, respectively. The mPFS of all patients was 2.5 months [95% confidence interval (CI): 2.166–2.834 months] and the mOS was 5.8 months (95% CI: 5.087–6.513 months). Both univariate and multivariate analyses revealed a significant increase in mOS or individuals who had previously undergone cranial radiation therapy compared to those who had not. Furthermore, different histology molecular types were found to be potentially associated with survival time. Conclusions: Some patients with NSCLC harboring targetable gene mutations following LM diagnosis may benefit from ICI treatment with relatively good tolerance. However, further screening of the most suitable patient populations for ICIs is required. © Translational Lung Cancer Research. All rights reserved.},

This study aims to assess the safety and efficacy of chemoimmunotherapy combined with thoracic radiotherapy in patients with ES-SCLC. Methods: This single-center retrospective study analyzed patients with ES-SCLC who received standard platinum–etoposide chemotherapy combined with atezolizumab or durvalumab immunotherapy as induction treatment, followed by consolidative thoracic radiotherapy (CTRT) before disease progression in the first-line setting. Adverse events during radiotherapy with or without maintenance immunotherapy and survival outcomes were assessed. Results: Between December 2019 and November 2021, 36 patients with ES-SCLC were identified to have received such treatment modality at one hospital. The number of metastatic sites at diagnosis was 1–4. The biological effective dose of CTRT ranged from 52 to 113 Gy. Only two patients (6%) developed grade 3 toxic effect of thrombocytopenia, but none experienced grade 4 or 5 toxicity. Four patients developed immune-related pneumonitis during the induction treatment period but successfully completed later CTRT. The rate of radiation-related pneumonitis was 8% with grades 1–2 and well tolerated. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 12.8 months, but the median overall survival (OS) was not determined. The estimated 1-year OS was 80.2% and 1-year PFS was 53.4%.

	abstract = {Background: Patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) experience significant therapeutic challenges and limited survival rates. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of combining immunotherapy (IT) with chemotherapy (CT) for treating ES-SCLC and to explore the synergistic effect between radiotherapy (RT) and IT. Methods: This retrospective analysis examined patients with ES-SCLC who received treatment at three centers. Furthermore, propensity score-matched (PSM) analysis was conducted. The Kaplan‒Meier method and Cox proportional hazards regression were used to compare the survival outcomes. Results: A total of 257 eligible patients with ES-SCLC were included in the analysis. Among all patients, the median overall survival (mOS) was 18.0 m in the chemoimmunotherapy (CT + IT) group and 15.7 m in the CT group (p = 0.208). The median real-world progression-free survival (mrwPFS) was 7.7 m and 6.8 m (p = 0.043) in the CT + IT and CT group, respectively. Moreover, the mOS was 22.0 m in the chemoradiotherapy (CT + RT) group and 13.6 m in the CT group (p < 0.001). The mrwPFS was 7.4 m and 6.0 m (p = 0.175) in the CT + RT group and CT group, respectively. The multivariate analyses revealed that sex, liver metastasis and RT were independent prognostic factors for OS (p < 0.05), while liver metastasis and IT were found to be independent predictive factors of real-world progression-free survival (rwPFS) (p < 0.05). After PSM, the mOS was 23.2 m in the CT + IT group and 13.0 m in the CT group (p = 0.008). The mrwPFS was 7.3 m and 6.2 m (p = 0.096) in the CT + IT group and the CT group, respectively. Moreover, the mOS was 21.4 m in the CT + RT group and 12.5 m in the CT group (p < 0.001). The mrwPFS was 7.3 m and 5.2 m (p = 0.220) in the CT + RT group and the CT group, respectively. Additionally, our study revealed that in the PD-1 group, RT significantly improved patient survival (36.0 m vs. 15.8 m, p = 0.041). Conclusion: An increasing number of treatment options are being explored for ES-SCLC, and CT is the cornerstone of treatment for this disease. Combining CT with IT and RT has demonstrated remarkable efficacy and excellent safety profiles, and such treatments are worthy of further exploration. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Background: First-line chemotherapy plus immunotherapy (CT-IO) has recently demonstrated survival benefits over CT alone in extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC), based on randomized phase III studies. This retrospective multicenter study assessed the real-world use and effectiveness of CT-IO in ES-SCLC patients. Patients and Methods: All newly diagnosed ES-SCLC patients from 4 French hospitals treated with CT alone or CT-IO between May 2020 and December 2021 were included. Overall survival (OS) and real-world progression-free survival (rwPFS) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazard models were performed to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) in univariate and multivariate models. The aim was not to compare efficacy between groups. Results: Among 104 patients, 75 (72.1%) received CT-IO. Brain metastases were diagnosed in 28.3% of patients, and 29.8% were performance status (PS) ≥ 2. At a median follow-up of 16.8 months (95%CI, 14.9-23.4), the median OS was 11.4 months (95%CI, 7.7-14.7) in the CT-IO group, and the 12-month OS rate was 43.6% (95%CI, 33.3-57.2). In the CT group, the median OS was 7.8 months (95%CI, 5.4-11.8) and the 12-month OS rate was 15.3% (95%CI, 5.7-41.0). In multivariate analyses, baseline brain and liver metastases were associated with a shorter OS for patients treated in the CT-IO group (HR, 3.80 [95%CI, 1.90-7.60] and 3.12 [95%CI, 1.60-6.08] respectively; P < 0.001 for both). Conclusion: We showed that clinicians have chosen to use IO beyond the specific criteria defined in guidelines. Survival data appeared promising with a median OS comparable to the one previously demonstrated in clinical trials. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.},

This study aimed to evaluate real-world effectiveness of immunotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC in Northern Thailand. Method: A retrospective, single-centered cohort, was conducted. Patients with advanced NSCLC who underwent PD-L1 testing (excluding EGFR and ALK mutations) and were treated with immunotherapy or without chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone were included. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). The secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and adverse events. Results: A total of 123 patients, of which 21 patients received immunotherapy-based regimen and 102 patients received chemotherapy alone. The median PFS was 11.9 months in immunotherapy-based group compared to 5.93 months in the chemotherapy group, with a. hazard ratio (HR) of 0.4 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.23 to 0.68; p = 0.001). Similarly, the median OS was 26.68 months in the immunotherapy-based group and 11.21 months in the chemotherapy group, with HR of 0.42 (95% CI 0.22–0.8; p = 0.009). ORRs were significantly higher in the immunotherapy-based group, with 65% of patients showing a response compared to 32% in the chemotherapy group (p = 0.006). Conclusion: The result of this real-world study in patients with advanced stage NSCLC indicate that first-line immunotherapy-based regimen was associated with significantly greater PFS, OS, and ORR with a safety profile consistent with pivotal studies. © 2024 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Until very recently, surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy have been the mainstay of treatment in non-small cell carcinomas (NSCLCs). However, recent advances in molecular immunology have unveiled some of the complexity of the mechanisms regulating cellular immune responses and led to the successful targeting of immune checkpoints in attempts to enhance antitumor T-cell responses. Immune checkpoint molecules such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein-4, programmed cell death protein-1, and programmed death ligand (PD-L) 1 have been shown to play central roles in evading cancer immunity. Thus, these molecules have been targeted by inhibitors for the management of cancers forming the basis of immunotherapy. Advanced NSCLC has been the paradigm for the benefits of immunotherapy in any cancer. Treatment decisions are made based on the expression of PD-L1 on the tumor cells and the presence or absence of driver mutations. Patients with high PD-L1 expression (≥50%) and no driver mutations are treated with single-agent immunotherapy whereas, for all other patients with a lower level of PD-L1 expression, a combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy is preferred. Thus, PD-L1 blockers are the only immunotherapeutic agents approved in advanced NSCLC without any oncogenic driver mutations. PD-L1 immunohistochemistry, however, may not be the best biomarker in view of its dynamic nature in time and space, and the benefits may be seen regardless of PD -L1 expression. Each immunotherapy molecule is prescribed based on the levels of PD-L1 expression as assessed by a Food and Drug Administration-approved companion diagnostic assay. Other biomarkers that have been studied include tumor mutational burden, the T-effector signature, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, radiomic assays, inflammation index, presence or absence of immune-related adverse events and specific driver mutations, and gut as well as local microbiome. At the current time, none of these biomarkers are routinely used in the clinical decision-making process for immunotherapy in NSCLC. However, in individual cases, they can be useful adjuncts to conventional therapy. This review describes our current understanding of the role of biomarkers as predictors of response to immune checkpoint molecules. To begin with a brief on cancer immunology in general and in NSCLC, in particular, is discussed. In the end, recent advancements in laboratory techniques for refining biomarker assays are described. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Progress in the treatment of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) has been modest over the past decades until the advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors, which have redefined the standard first-line treatment for extensive-stage SCLC (ES-SCLC). However, despite the positive results of several clinical trials, the limited survival benefit achieved suggests that the priming and sustaining of immunotherapeutic efficacy are poor and further investigation is urgently needed. In this review, we aim to summarize the potential mechanisms underlying the limited efficacy of immunotherapy and intrinsic resistance in ES-SCLC, including impaired antigen presentation and limited T cell infiltration. Moreover, to tackle the current dilemma, given the synergistic effects of radiotherapy on immunotherapy, especially the unique advantages of low-dose radiotherapy (LDRT), such as less immunosuppression and lower radiation toxicity, we propose radiotherapy as a booster to enhance the immunotherapeutic efficacy by overcoming the poor priming effect. Recent clinical trials, including ours, have also focused on adding radiotherapy, including LDRT, to first-line treatment of ES-SCLC. Additionally, we also suggest combination strategies to sustain the immunostimulatory effect of radiotherapy, as well as the cancer-immunity cycle, and further improve survival outcomes. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Cancer treatment has been advanced with the advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) exemplified by anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) drugs. Patients have reaped substantial benefit from ICIs in many cancer types. However, few patients benefit from ICIs whereas the vast majority undergoing these treatments do not obtain survival benefit. Even for patients with initial responses, they may encounter drug resistance in their subsequent treatments, which limits the efficacy of ICIs. Therefore, a deepening understanding of drug resistance is critically important for the explorations of approaches to reverse drug resistance and to boost ICI efficacy. In the present review, different mechanisms of ICI resistance have been summarized according to the tumor intrinsic, tumor microenvironment (TME) and host classifications. We further elaborated corresponding strategies to battle against such resistance accordingly, which include targeting defects in antigen presentation, dysregulated interferon-γ (IFN-γ) signaling, neoantigen depletion, upregulation of other T cell checkpoints as well as immunosuppression and exclusion mediated by TME. Moreover, regarding the host, several additional approaches that interfere with diet and gut microbiome have also been described in reversing ICI resistance. Additionally, we provide an overall glimpse into the ongoing clinical trials that utilize these mechanisms to overcome ICI resistance. Finally, we summarize the challenges and opportunities that needs to be addressed in the investigation of ICI resistance mechanisms, with the aim to benefit more patients with cancer. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

Previous studies from PubMed, Cochrane Library and Embase databases were searched for a meta‑analysis. A total of 16 studies were included in part one of the meta‑analysis and it was observed that consolidation of ICIs after CRT improved overall survival (OS) [hazard ratio (HR) 1.46; P=0.005] and progression‑free survival (PFS) (HR 1.26; P=0.023) for the patients with PD‑L1 expression ≥1% compared with those with PD‑L1 expression <1%. Then, 15 studies were included in part two of the meta‑analysis and the results indicated that the pooled 1, 2 and 3‑year OS were 77% vs. 83% (P=0.07), 55% vs. 59% (P=0.327) and 38% vs. 51% (P=0.006) for CRT alone compared with CRT followed by consolidation of ICIs, respectively. The pooled 1, 2 and 3‑year PFS were 51% vs. 53% (P=0.632), 29% vs. 40% (P=0.015) and 20% vs. 28% (P=0.153) for CRT alone compared with CRT followed by consolidation of ICIs, respectively. The findings of the present study highlighted that the benefits of CRT followed by consolidation of ICIs were higher compared with CRT alone in patients with unresectable, locally advanced NSCLC and PD‑L1 expression <1%.

	abstract = {Background: Durvalumab and atezolizumab have recently been approved in extensive small cell lung cancer (SCLC) with moderate median overall survival (OS) improvements. However, only limited data exist regarding the impact of immunotherapy in real-world SCLC patients. This study sought to assess the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab plus chemotherapy and durvalumab plus chemotherapy in the treatment of SCLC in a real-world setting. Methods: A retrospective cohort study of all patients treated for SCLC with chemotherapy with PD-L1 inhibitor, at 3 centers in China between February 1, 2020 and April 30, 2022. Patient characteristics, adverse-events and survival analyses were conducted. Results: A total of 143 patients were enrolled in this study, 100 were treated with durvalumab and the remainder with atezolizumab. The baseline characteristics of the two groups were fundamentally balanced before using PD-L1 inhibitors (P>0.05). The median OS (mOS) of the patients who received durvalumab or atezolizumab as the first-line treatment were 22.0 and 10.0 months, respectively (P=0.03). Survival analysis of patients with brain metastasis (BM) revealed that the median progression-free survival (mPFS) of patients without BM treated with durvalumab plus chemotherapy (5.5 months) was longer than that of those with BM (4.0 months) (P=0.03). In contrast, in the atezolizumab plus chemotherapy regimen, BM did not affect survival. In addition, the addition of radiotherapy to treatment with PD-L1 inhibitors in combination with chemotherapy has a tendency to improve long-term survival. As for safety analysis, there was no significant difference in the incidence of immune-related adverse events (IRAEs) during PD-L1 inhibitor therapy between the 2 groups (P>0.05). And during treatment with immunochemotherapy, radiotherapy was not associated with the development of IRAE (P=0.42) but increased the risk of immune-related pneumonitis (P=0.026). Conclusions: The implication of this study for clinical practice is a preference for durvalumab in first-line immunotherapy for SCLC. In addition, appropriate radiotherapy during treatment with PD-L1 inhibitors in combination with chemotherapy may prolong long-term survival, but the occurrence of immune-related pneumonitis should be vigilant. Data from this study are limited and the baseline characteristics of the two populations still need to be more finely classified. © 2023 AME Publishing Company. All rights reserved.},

This review discusses the existing studies and prospective directions of chemotherapy-free iRT strategies in unresectable LA-NSCLC. Although the initial findings of chemotherapy-free iRT strategies have shown promising efficacy, we must consider the methodologic limitations of current studies and the myriad of challenges that accompany the implementation of chemotherapy-free iRT. These challenges include determining the optimal dose and fractionation, precise target volume delineation, and identification of additional suitable patient cohorts. Furthermore, the feasibility of chemotherapy-free iRT as a novel treatment modality for select patients with LA-NSCLC is contingent upon validation through randomized phase III trials. ©2023 Cancer Biology & Medicine.},

	abstract = {Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) represent the cornerstone of the current treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the occurrence of concomitant infections might hamper success. All consecutive patients with advanced NSCLC who started ICIs as a first- or second-line therapy from January 1, 2017 to June 30, 2020 were retrospectively evaluated. The occurrence of infectious events during ICIs was correlated with clinical characteristics, including previous Cytotoxic Chemotherapy (CC), occurrence of immune-related-adverse-events (irAEs). A total of 211 patients were included, 46 (22%) females, with a median (q1-q3) age of 69 (62-76) years. Overall, 85 patients (40%) received ICIs as a first treatment line and 126 (60%) as a second line; 40 patients (19%) had at least one infection during ICIs, and 17 (8%) more than one. Notably, autoimmune diseases (P <.005), neutropenia (P =.001) or infections during previous CC (P =.001), irAEs (P =.006), or steroid therapy for irAEs (P <.001) were associated with infection development. By multivariate Cox-regression, autoimmune diseases (aHR = 6.27; 95%CI = 2.38-16.48; P <.001) and steroid therapy for irAEs (aHR = 2.65; 95%CI = 1.27-5.52; P <.009) were associated with a higher risk of infection during ICIs. Interestingly, autoimmune diseases were confirmed as risk factors in patients treated with ICIs as a first line, while previous infections were the only independent predictor of infections in patients treated with ICIs as a second line. Patients with NSCLC treated with ICIs with concurrent autoimmune disease, receiving steroid therapy for management of irAEs, or having a history of previous infections during CC should be actively monitored for the risk of developing infectious complications. © 2023 The Authors.

We collected clinical parameters to evaluate the dynamic changes in the primary tumor. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine the correlations between these parameters and the pathologic response of the primary tumor. Subsequently, we constructed prediction models for pCR and MPR using multivariate logistic regression. The MPR prediction Model 2 was internally validated using bootstrapping and externally validated using an independent cohort from our center. The univariate logistic analysis revealed significant differences in clinical parameters reflecting tumor regression among patients with varying pathologic responses. The clinical models based on these assessments demonstrated excellent predictive performance, with the training cohort achieving a C-index of 0.879 for pCR and 0.912 for MPR, while the testing cohort also achieved a C-index of 0.912 for MPR. Notably, the MPR prediction Model 2, with a threshold cut-off of 0.74, exhibited 92.7% specificity and greater than 70% sensitivity, indicating a low rate of underestimating residual tumors. In conclusion, our study demonstrated the high accuracy of clinical assessment-based models in pathologic response prediction, aiding in decision-making regarding organ preservation and radiotherapy adjustments after induction immunochemotherapy. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Background: In the preplanned interim analysis of the TOPAZ-1 study, durvalumab plus gemcitabine–cisplatin significantly improved overall survival versus placebo plus gemcitabine–cisplatin in participants with advanced biliary tract cancer. We aimed to report updated overall survival and safety data from TOPAZ-1 with additional follow-up and data maturity beyond the interim analysis. Methods: TOPAZ-1 was a phase 3, randomised, double-masked, placebo-controlled, global study done at 105 sites in 17 countries. Participants aged 18 years or older with unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic biliary tract cancer were randomly assigned (1:1) to durvalumab plus gemcitabine–cisplatin or placebo plus gemcitabine–cisplatin using a computer-generated randomisation scheme, stratified by disease status and primary tumour location. Participants received durvalumab (1500 mg) or placebo on day 1 of each cycle every 3 weeks for up to eight cycles, plus gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2) and cisplatin (25 mg/m2) intravenously on days 1 and 8 of each cycle every 3 weeks for up to eight cycles, followed by durvalumab (1500 mg) or placebo monotherapy every 4 weeks until disease progression or other discontinuation criteria were met. Investigators and participants were masked to study treatment. The primary endpoint was overall survival. TOPAZ-1 met its primary endpoint at the preplanned interim analysis, and the study is active but no longer recruiting participants. Updated overall survival and safety data from TOPAZ-1, with additional follow-up (data cutoff Feb 25, 2022) and data maturity beyond the interim analysis, are reported here. Efficacy was assessed in the full analysis set (all randomly assigned participants). Safety was assessed in the safety analysis set (all participants who received at least one dose of study treatment). The TOPAZ-1 study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03875235. Findings: From April 16, 2019, to Dec 11, 2020, 914 participants were enrolled, 685 of whom were randomly assigned (341 to the durvalumab plus gemcitabine–cisplatin group and 344 to the placebo plus gemcitabine–cisplatin group). 345 (50%) participants were male and 340 (50%) were female. Median follow-up at the updated data cutoff was 23·4 months (95% CI 20·6–25·2) in the durvalumab plus gemcitabine–cisplatin group and 22·4 months (21·4–23·8) in the placebo plus gemcitabine–cisplatin group. At the updated data cutoff, 248 (73%) participants in the durvalumab plus gemcitabine–cisplatin group and 279 (81%) participants in the placebo plus gemcitabine–cisplatin group had died (median overall survival 12·9 months [95% CI 11·6–14·1] vs 11·3 months [10·1–12·5]; hazard ratio 0·76 [95% CI 0·64–0·91]). Kaplan–Meier-estimated 24-month overall survival rates were 23·6% (95% CI 18·7–28·9) in the durvalumab plus gemcitabine–cisplatin group and 11·5% (7·6–16·2) in the placebo plus gemcitabine–cisplatin group. Maximum grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in 250 (74%) of 338 participants in the durvalumab plus gemcitabine–cisplatin group and 257 (75%) of 342 in the placebo plus gemcitabine–cisplatin group. The most common maximum grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events were decreased neutrophil count (70 [21%] vs 86 [25%]), anaemia (64 [19%] vs 64 [19%]), and neutropenia (63 [19%] vs 68 [20%]). Interpretation: Durvalumab plus gemcitabine–cisplatin showed robust and sustained overall survival benefit with no new safety signals.

	abstract = {Background: Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) has become pivotal in the treatment of advanced lung cancer, yet the absence of reliable biomarkers for assessing treatment response poses a significant challenge. This study aims to explore the predictive value of various lymphocyte subsets in different lung cancer subtypes, thus potentially identifying novel biomarkers to improve ICI treatment stratification and outcomes. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 146 stage III or IV lung cancer patients undergoing ICI treatment. The study focused on exploring the relationship between various lymphocyte subsets and the efficacy of ICIs, aiming to determine their predictive value for post-treatment outcomes. Results: Subgroup analysis revealed a positive correlation (P=0.01) between lower CD3+CD8+ T lymphocyte levels and treatment response in squamous cell carcinoma patients. However, no significance was observed in lung adenocarcinoma patients. Additionally, the predictive ability of lymphocyte subsets for different immunotherapy drugs varies. In individuals receiving anti-programmed cell death ligand 1 (PDL1) treatment, a lower CD3+CD8+ T lymphocyte levels is significantly associated with a positive treatment outcome (P=0.002), while there is no difference for programmed death 1 (PD-1) drugs. Among patients under 60, higher expression of CD3+CD4+ T lymphocytes (P=0.03) combined with lower CD3+CD8+ T lymphocyte levels (P=0.006) showed a statistically significant association with improved treatment response. However, in patients aged over 60, no discernible correlation was ascertained between lymphocyte subsets and therapeutic response. Through prognostic analysis, two distinct lymphocyte subsets were identified, both exerting considerable impact on progression-free survival subsequent to ICIs treatment: CD3+CD4+ T lymphocytes [hazard ratio (HR) =0.50, P=0.006] and CD3+CD8+ T lymphocytes (HR =1.78, P=0.02). Conclusions: Our findings underscore the significant heterogeneity in the predictive value of distinct lymphocyte subsets for lung cancer patients undergoing ICI treatment. These findings are particularly salient when considering various pathological types, immunotherapeutic agents, and patient age groups. © Translational Lung Cancer Research. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Introduction: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of chemoimmunotherapy combined with consolidative thoracic radiation therapy (cTRT) in patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). Methods: A meta-analysis was conducted. PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library were searched. The study was registered in PROSPERO (registration no. CRD42023410344). Results: A total of 4677 studies were initially screened and 15 studies encompassing a total of 1033 patients were included. Chemoimmunotherapy combined with cTRT significantly improved survival (HR = 0.52, 95 % CI: 0.39, 0.68) with favorable 6-month (0.89, 95 % CI: 0.77, 1.00) and 1-year (0.77, 95 % CI: 0.72, 0.82) OS, without affecting ≥3 grade TRAEs (RR = 1.29, 95 % CI: 0.85, 1.98). Pooled 6-month and 1-year PFS were 0.67 (95 % CI: 0.47, 0.86) and 0.38 (95 % CI: 0.22, 0.55), respectively. Incidence of ≥3 grade TRAEs was 0.24 (95 % CI: 0.08, 0.39) and radiation pneumonitis was 0.03 (95 % CI: 0.01, 0.06). Conclusions: Chemoimmunotherapy combined with cTRT improves survival and shows favorable outcomes in ES-SCLC patients, with manageable adverse events.

	abstract = {Background: Brain metastasis is a frequent complication in small cell lung cancer (SCLC), and there is an urgent need for new treatment modalities, given the limited success of traditional approaches. This study evaluates the combined efficacy and safety of brain radiotherapy (BRT), chemotherapy, and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in the treatment of brain metastases in patients with extensive-stage SCLC (ES-SCLC). Additionally, it seeks to identify prognostic factors in these cases. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on 187 patients with ES-SCLC and brain metastases treated at Zhejiang Cancer Hospital from January 2017 to October 2023. Patients were divided into three groups based on their initial treatment: BRT alone, ICI alone, and a combined ICI + BRT approach, with chemotherapy included in all regimens. Variables such as age, number of brain metastases, symptoms, comorbidities, Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) scores, smoking history, Graded Prognostic Assessment (GPA) scores, survival time, and treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs), including hematologic and hepatic toxicities were evaluated. Prognostic factors were assessed using univariate and multivariate analyses via Cox’s proportional hazards model. The study also compared outcomes and TRAEs between patients undergoing synchronous treatment (ICI and BRT within four weeks) versus those with asynchronous therapy (more than four weeks apart). Results: Median overall survival (OS) times differed significantly across the groups: 11.6 months for BRT, 11.6 months for ICI, and 20.9 months for ICI + BRT (P<0.001). The ICI + BRT group also exhibited notably better progression-free survival (PFS) and intracranial PFS (iPFS), with medians of 12.6 and 14.9 months, respectively (P<0.001). This group demonstrated significantly improved systemic and intracranial objective response rates (ORR) and disease control rates (DCR). No significant differences in acute radiation injury rates were observed between the BRT and ICI + BRT groups. Multivariate analysis identified several factors influencing OS, including treatment regimen, number of chemotherapy and ICI cycles, presence of bone and multiple brain metastases, and antiangiogenesis therapies and extracranial radiotherapy. Both atezolizumab and serplulimab ICIs, in combination with various radiotherapy regimens [whole BRT (WBRT), WBRT with boost], were effective. Notably, asynchronous ICI and BRT treatment demonstrated advantages in PFS and iPFS over concurrent therapy, with no significant differences in other therapeutic indices or TRAE incidence rates. Conclusions: For ES-SCLC patients with synchronous brain metastases, combined ICI and BRT, alongside chemotherapy, surpasses the efficacy of either treatment alone with manageable TRAEs. Importantly, asynchronous ICI and BRT therapy showed superior outcomes compared to synchronous treatment modalities. © AME Publishing Company.},

	abstract = {Objectives: To investigate the risk of hemorrhage associated with Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICIs) and characterize its clinical features. Methods: We systematically reviewed randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of hemorrhage related to ICIs and calculated odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Pharmacovigilance studies were conducted by collecting ICIs-related hemorrhage cases from the FAERS database and assessing disproportionalities by reporting odds ratios (RORs) and information components (ICs). Results: A total of 79 RCTs involving 45,100 patients were finally included in the systematic review, with four published RCTs (n = 1965) and 75 unpublished RCTs (n = 43135). The primary analysis showed no significant difference in ICIs compared to the control group (OR 1.18 [95% CI 1.00–1.38], p = 0.05). In subgroup analyses, anti-PD-L1 combined with anti-CTLA-4 increased the risk of hemorrhage (OR 1.95, p = 0.03), and anti-CTLA-4 increased the risk of hemorrhage in the gastrointestinal system (OR 2.23, p = 0.04). 3555 cases of hemorrhage from the FAERS database were included in the disproportionate analysis, and the result suggested that ICIs increased the risk of hemorrhage (IC025 = 0.23). Conclusion: Our study suggests that ICIs increase the risk of hemorrhage, and in particular, anti-CTLA-4 significantly increases the risk of hemorrhage in the gastrointestinal system. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Purpose This study aimed to compare the failure patterns before and after the introduction of immunotherapy and to determine the role of thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) in extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) treatment. Materials and Methods We retrospectively reviewed 294 patients with ES-SCLC, of which 62.2% underwent chemotherapy alone, 13.3% underwent chemotherapy followed by consolidative TRT (TRT group), and 24.5% underwent chemotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI group). We performed propensity-score matching (PSM) to compare each treatment group. Results The median follow-up duration was 10.4 months. At the first relapse, in the cohort showing objective response, the proportion of cases showing intrathoracic progression was significantly lower in the TRT group (37.8%) than in the chemotherapy-alone (77.2%, p < 0.001) and the ICI (60.3%, p=0.03) groups. Furthermore, in the subgroup analysis, TRT showed benefits related to intrathoracic progression-free survival (PFS) in comparison with ICI in patients with less than two involved extrathoracic sites (p=0.008) or without liver metastasis (p=0.02) or pleural metastasis (p=0.005) at diagnosis. After PSM, the TRT group showed significantly better intrathoracic PFS than both chemotherapy-alone and ICI groups (p < 0.001 and p=0.04, respectively), but showed no significant benefit in terms of PFS and overall survival in comparison with the ICI group (p=0.17 and p=0.31, respectively). Conclusion In ES-SCLC, intrathoracic progression was the most dominant failure pattern after immunotherapy. In the era of chemoimmunotherapy, consolidative TRT can still be considered a useful treatment strategy for locoregional control. © 2024 Korean Cancer Association. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive, neuroendocrine tumour with high relapse rates, and significant morbidity and mortality. Apart from advances in radiation therapy, progress in the systemic treatment of SCLC had been stagnant for over three decades despite multiple attempts to develop alternative therapeutic options that could improve responses and survival. Recent promising developments in first-line and subsequent therapeutic approaches prompted a Canadian Expert Panel to convene to review evidence, discuss practice patterns, and reach a consensus on the treatment of extensive-stage SCLC (ES-SCLC). The literature search included guidelines, systematic reviews, and randomized controlled trials. Regular meetings were held from September 2022 to March 2023 to discuss the available evidence to propose and agree upon specific recommendations. The panel addressed biomarkers and histological features that distinguish SCLC from non-SCLC and other neuroendocrine tumours. Evidence for initial and subsequent systemic therapies was reviewed with consideration for patient performance status, comorbidities, and the involvement and function of other organs. The resulting consensus recommendations herein will help clarify evidence-based management of ES-SCLC in routine practice, help clinician decision-making, and facilitate the best patient outcomes. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Locally advanced esophageal cancer (LAEC) poses a significant and persistent challenge in terms of effective treatment. Traditionally, the primary strategy for managing LAEC has involved concurrent neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery. However, achieving a pathologic complete response (pCR) has proven to be inconsistent, and despite treatment, roughly half of patients experience locoregional recurrence or metastasis. Consequently, there has been a paradigm shift towards exploring the potential of immunotherapy in reshaping the landscape of LAEC management. Recent research has particularly focused on immune checkpoint inhibitors, investigating their application in both neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings. These inhibitors, designed to block specific proteins in immune cells, are meant to enhance the immune system’s ability to target and combat cancer cells. Emerging evidence from these studies suggests the possibility of a mortality benefit, indicating that immunotherapy may contribute to improved overall survival rates for individuals grappling with esophageal cancer. This manuscript aims to meticulously review the existing literature surrounding neoadjuvant and adjuvant immunotherapy in the context of LAEC management. The intention is to thoroughly examine the methodologies and findings of relevant studies, providing a comprehensive synthesis of the current understanding of the impact of immunotherapy on esophageal cancer. © 2024 by the authors.},

Their incidence seems to be higher in patients with oncogene-driven tumours, especially those with EGFR-mutated or ALK-rearranged tumours. Although targeted treatments demonstrate significant efficacy regarding BM, they only apply to a minority of NSCLC patients. On the other hand, systemic therapies for nononcogenic-driven NSCLC with BM have shown limited clinical benefit. In recent years, immunotherapy alone or combined with chemotherapy has been adopted as a new standard of care in first-line therapy. This approach seems to be beneficial to patients with BM in terms of efficacy and toxicity. Combined immune checkpoint inhibition as well as the combination of immunotherapy and radiation therapy show promising results with significant, but overall acceptable toxicity. A pragmatic approach of allowing enrolment of patients with untreated or symptomatic BM in randomised trials evaluating immune checkpoint inhibitors strategies, possibly coupled with central nervous system-related endpoints may be needed to generate data to refine treatment for this patient population. © 2023 The Authors.

However, the optimal choice for second-line treatment after initial treatment with ICIs is unclear. This study aimed to clarify the efficacy and safety of ICI rechallenge therapy in locally advanced and advanced NSCLC. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the histories of 224 patients with locally advanced or advanced NSCLC treated with programmed death-1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors alone or in combination with chemotherapy and/or antiangiogenic therapy in first-line treatment. Progression-free survival 2 (PFS2) was the time from the first defined progress disease (PD) to the second disease progression or death. Efficacy evaluation was performed directly in accordance with RECIST v1.1 criteria. Adverse events (AEs) were graded following the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v5.0. Survival data were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method or Cox survival regression model and compared using the log-rank test in overall cohort and other subgroups. Results: There were no significant differences in objective response rate (ORR) and median PFS2 (mPFS2) between the ICI rechallenge group and non-rechallenge group (ORR: 10.3% vs. 15.3%, P=0.308; mPFS2: 5.33 vs. 4.40 months, P=0.715). And the ICI rechallenge group showed no new safety signals compared with non-rechallenge group. In ICI rechallenge group, patients resistant to first-line immunotherapy had a lower ORR and shorter PFS2 compared with those who responded to initial ICIs treatment (ORR: 7.0% vs. 17.6%, P=0.038; mPFS2: 3.68 vs. 5.91 months, P=0.014). No significant difference in mPFS2 was observed among different second-line treatment groups (P=0.362). Radiotherapy in second-line treatment and ICI rechallenge therapy were not the main factors affecting PFS2. Conclusions: ICI rechallenge therapy beyond disease progression did not improve clinical outcomes in patients with NSCLC, but no new safety signals emerged. However, patients with favorable response to initial ICIs treatment still showed significant efficacy of subsequent ICI rechallenge therapy. © Journal of Thoracic Disease. All rights reserved.},

Research suggests immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) post-chemoradiotherapy enhance survival, but the impact of concurrent ICIs during chemoradiotherapy on rapid disease progression is unclear. This meta-analysis aims to assess the effectiveness and safety of concurrent ICIs with radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy in advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Methods We searched PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science for relevant studies, extracting data on overall response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and adverse events (AEs). Results The analysis included ten studies with 490 participants. Stage III NSCLC ORR was 81.8%, while Stage IV ORR was 39.9%. One-year PFS and OS for Stage III were 68.2% and 82.6%, compared to 27.9% and 72.2% for Stage IV. Common adverse events included anemia (46.6%), nausea (47.6%), rash (36.4%), and radiation pneumonitis (36.3%). Conclusions Our meta-analysis shows concurrent ICIs with chemoradiotherapy are effective and safe in advanced NSCLC, particularly in stage III patients at risk of progression before starting ICIs after chemoradiotherapy. The findings support further phase III trials. The review protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42023493685) and is detailed on the NIHR HTA programme website.  © 2024 Cui et al.

	abstract = {Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) remains a disease with poor prognosis, particularly in extensive-stage SCLC (ES-SCLC). Current standard-of-care treatment includes chemotherapy with platinum agents and etoposide plus immunotherapy with atezolizumab or durvalumab, which has achieved a mean overall survival of 12–13 months in clinical trials. However, long-term survival in ES-SCLC, even with the addition of immunotherapy, continues to be rare. We present the case of a middle-aged male patient diagnosed with ES-SCLC who was treated with four cycles of induction chemotherapy (carboplatin and etoposide) and atezolizumab, starting maintenance atezolizumab every 21 days thereafter, and thoracic radiotherapy. After 9 months, he experienced mild disease progression and was rechallenged with six cycles of carboplatin and etoposide with continued atezolizumab. Subsequent imaging showed near-complete disease resolution which has been sustained since. He has continued on maintenance atezolizumab since diagnosis and has achieved 60 months overall survival and 44 months progression-free survival. Throughout treatment, he has maintained a high functional capacity and only experienced one immune-related adverse event. Our patient is representative of a small subset who are capable of achieving durable responses to immunotherapy and his case highlights the need for further research to elucidate the clinical and biological factors driving this response. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Purpose. Different combination modalities between an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agent and a platinum-based chemotherapy or another checkpoint inhibitor (with or without a short course or full course of a platinum doublet) proved superior to chemotherapy alone in multiple clinical trials, but these strategies were not directly compared. The aim of this study is to report the real-world data results with different immunotherapy combinations in a series of patients treated in consecutive cohorts at the Ion Chiricuță Oncology Institute. Methods. A total of 122 patients were successively enrolled in three cohorts: (1A) nivolumab + ipilimumab (18 patients), (1B) nivolumab + ipilimumab + short-course chemotherapy (33 patients), and (2) pembrolizumab plus full-course chemotherapy (71 patients). Endpoints included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), objective response (ORR), and univariate and multivariate exploratory analysis of prognostic factors. RESULTS. Median follow-up in the consecutive cohorts 1A, 1B, and 2 was 83 versus 59 versus 14.2 months. Median OS and PFS for all patients were 22.2 and 11.5 months, respectively, and 2-year actuarial OS and PFS were 49% and 35%, respectively. For the nivolumab + ipilimumab (cohorts 1A and 1B) versus pembrolizumab combinations (cohort 2), median OS was 14 vs. 24.8 months (p = 0.18) and 2-year actuarial survival 42% vs. 53%; median PFS was 8.6 vs. 12.7 months (p = 0.41) and 2-year actuarial PFS 34% vs. 35%; response rates were 33.3% vs. 47.9% (p = 0.22). Older age, impaired PS (2 versus 0–1), corticotherapy in the first month of immunotherapy, and >3.81 neutrophils to lymphocytes ratio were independent unfavorable prognostic factors in the multivariate analysis of survival (limited to 2 years follow-up). The 5-year long-term survival was 30.5% and 18.8% for cohorts 1A and 1B, respectively (not enough follow-up for cohort 2). Conclusions. Efficacy results using different immunotherapy combination strategies were promising and not significantly different between protocols at 2 years. Real-world efficacy and long-term results in our series were in line with those reported in the corresponding registration trials. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Background: The incidence of checkpoint inhibitor-associated pneumonitis (CIP) in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has been substantiated through large-scale clinical trials or real-world studies. However, reports on CIP incidence within the context of neoadjuvant immunotherapy for resectable NSCLC remain scarce. This study endeavors to investigate the incidence, risk factors, and outcomes of CIP in patients with resectable NSCLC receiving neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy. Methods: A retrospective, case-control study was conducted on patients diagnosed with NSCLC stages IIA–IIIB who received neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy between January 2018 and September 2022. Patients were stratified into two groups based on the presence or absence of CIP, facilitating a comparative analysis of clinical characteristics, treatment modalities, physiological indicators, and prognostic outcomes. Results: The study cohort comprised 245 patients, with 11.4% (28/245) experiencing CIP. The median period of CIP onset was 70 (range, 40–221) days. The incidence of severe CIP (grade 3–4) was 3.7% (9/245). Patients with CIP showed a higher all-cause mortality rate of 21.4% (6/28) compared to that of patients without CIP. Those who developed CIP exhibited elevated body mass index (BMI) values (p = 0.028) and increased fibrinogen (FIB) levels (p < 0.001), alongside a significant decrease in both diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO)% pred (p = 0.001) and DLCO/VA% pred (p = 0.021) after neoadjuvant therapy compared to pre-indicators. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis showed that the area under the ROC curve of three assessed variables (FIB levels, BMI, DLCO) reached 0.806 in predicting CIP occurrence at an early stage. Conclusions: This cohort demonstrated that elevated BMI, increased FIB levels, and decreased pulmonary diffusion function after neoadjuvant therapy are risk factors of CIP occurrence. Early assessment and continuous monitoring of these indicators are imperative for the predictive identification of CIP, enhancing patient management and outcomes. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Lung cancer is categorized into two main types: non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer. Of these, NSCLC accounts for approximately 85% of all cases and encompasses varieties such as squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. For patients with advanced NSCLC that do not have oncogene addiction, the preferred treatment approach is a combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy. However, the progression-free survival (PFS) typically ranges only from about 6 to 8 months, accompanied by certain adverse events. In order to carry out individualized treatment more effectively, it is urgent to accurately screen patients with PFS for more than 12 months under this treatment regimen. Therefore, this study undertook a retrospective collection of pulmonary CT images from 60 patients diagnosed with NSCLC treated at the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University. It developed a machine learning model, designated as bSGSRIME-SVM, which integrates the rime optimization algorithm with self-adaptive Gaussian kernel probability search (SGSRIME) and support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Specifically, the model initiates its process by employing the SGSRIME algorithm to identify pivotal image features. Subsequently, it utilizes an SVM classifier to assess these features, aiming to enhance the model's predictive accuracy. Initially, the superior optimization capability and robustness of SGSRIME in IEEE CEC 2017 benchmark functions were validated. Subsequently, employing color moments and gray-level co-occurrence matrix methods, image features were extracted from images of 60 NSCLC patients undergoing immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy. The developed model was then utilized for analysis. The results indicate a significant advantage of the model in predicting the efficacy of immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy for NSCLC, with an accuracy of 92.381% and a specificity of 96.667%. This lays the foundation for more accurate PFS predictions and personalized treatment plans. © 2024},

	abstract = {Objective: As monotherapy such as topotecan has reached a plateau of effectiveness, new second-line treatments based on experience have been used in clinical application. This study compared the efficacy and safety of different second-line treatments for advanced small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). Methods: A total of 380 patients with advanced SCLC were screened selectively in the retrospective study. Adverse events and patient responses were assessed using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v5.0 and Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumors v1.1. The progression-free survival (PFS) was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method or Cox survival regression model and compared using the log-rank test. Results: In the platinum-resistant group, disease control rate (DCR) and median PFS (mPFS) were prolonged in the combination group versus single-agent group (DCR: 49.24% vs 24.39%, P =.004; mPFS: 3.73 vs 1.90 months, P <.001). Grade 3/4 toxicity was similar between the 2 groups (P =.683). The mPFS did not differ among single-agent groups (P =.380). No significant difference was observed in mPFS of different combination therapy groups (P =.170). In terms of platinum-based chemotherapy, the DCR and mPFS were prolonged in irinotecan-platinum group versus taxol-platinum group (DCR: 56.14% vs 9.09%, P =.004; mPFS: 3.87 vs 1.93 months, P =.012). Grade 3/4 toxicity was similar between the 2 groups (P =.614). The mPFS was prolonged in the chemotherapy plus immunotherapy group versus single-agent chemotherapy group (P =.003). In the platinum-sensitive group, the mPFS did not differ between the combination group and single-agent group (P =.200). The mPFS did not differ among different single-agent groups (P =.260) or combination groups (P =.150). There was no difference in mPFS among different platinum-based chemotherapy groups (P =.830). Conclusions: For patients with platinum-resistant SCLC, combination therapy has shown better efficacy and acceptable toxicity profile than monotherapy. Among combination therapies, irinotecan–platinum has shown better efficacy than taxol–platinum. For patients with platinum-sensitive SCLC, the efficacy of different single-agent or combination therapies was similar. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Background and Objective: Pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinoma (PSC) is a subset of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with highly malignant, aggressive, and heterogeneous features. Patients with this disease account for approximately 0.1–0.4% of lung cancer cases. The absence of comprehensive summaries on the basic biology and clinical treatments for PSC means there is limited systematic awareness and understanding of this rare disease. This paper provides an overview of the biological characteristics of PSC and systematically summarizes various treatment strategies available for patients with this disease. Methods: For this narrative review, we have searched literature related to the basic biology and clinical treatment approaches of PSC by searching the PubMed database for articles published from July 16, 1990 to August 29, 2023. The following keywords were used: “pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinoma”, “genetic mutations”, “immune microenvironment”, “hypoxia”, “angiogenesis”, “overall survival”, “surgery”, “radiotherapy”, “chemotherapy”, and “immune checkpoint inhibitors”. Key Content and Findings: Classical PSC comprises epithelial and sarcomatoid components, with most studies suggesting a common origin. PSC exhibits a higher tumor mutational burden (TMB) and mutation frequency than other types of NSCLC. The tumor microenvironment (TME) of PSC is characterized by hypoxia, hypermetabolism, elevated programmed cell death protein 1/programmed cell death-ligand 1 expression, and high immune cell infiltration. Treatment strategies for advanced PSC are mainly based on traditional NSCLC treatments, but PSC exhibits resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The advancement of genome sequencing has introduced targeted therapies as an option for mutation-positive PSC cases. Moreover, due to the characteristics of the immune microenvironment of PSC, many patients positively respond to immunotherapy, demonstrating its potential for the management of PSC. Conclusions: Although several studies have examined and assessed the TME of PSC, these are limited in quantity and quality, presenting challenges for research into the clinical treatment strategies for PSC. With the emergence of new technologies and the advancement of clinical research, for example, savolitinib’s clinical study for MET exon 14 skipping mutations positive PSC patients have shown promising outcomes, more in-depth studies on PSC are eagerly anticipated. © Translational Lung Cancer Research.

	abstract = {Background: Pneumonitis is a common complication for patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer undergoing definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT). It remains unclear whether there is ethnic difference in the incidence of post-CRT pneumonitis. Methods: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science were searched for eligible studies from January 1, 2000 to April 30, 2023. The outcomes of interest were incidence rates of pneumonitis. The random-effect model was used for statistical analysis. This meta-analysis was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42023416490). Findings: A total of 248 studies involving 28,267 patients were included. Among studies of CRT without immunotherapy, the pooled rates of pneumonitis for Asian patients were significantly higher than that for non-Asian patients (all grade: 66.8%, 95% CI: 59.2%–73.9% vs. 28.1%, 95% CI: 20.4%–36.4%; P < 0.0001; grade ≥2: 25.1%, 95% CI: 22.9%–27.3% vs. 14.9%, 95% CI: 12.0%–18.0%; P < 0.0001; grade ≥3: 6.5%, 95% CI: 5.6%–7.3% vs. 4.6%, 95% CI: 3.4%–5.9%; P = 0.015; grade 5: 0.6%, 95% CI: 0.3%–0.9% vs. 0.1%, 95% CI: 0.0%–0.2%; P < 0.0001). Regarding studies of CRT plus immunotherapy, Asian patients had higher rates of all-grade (74.8%, 95% CI: 63.7%–84.5% vs. 34.3%, 95% CI: 28.7%–40.2%; P < 0.0001) and grade ≥2 (34.0%, 95% CI: 30.7%–37.3% vs. 24.6%, 95% CI: 19.9%–29.3%; P = 0.001) pneumonitis than non-Asian patients, but with no significant differences in the rates of grade ≥3 and grade 5 pneumonitis. Results from subgroup analyses were generally similar to that from the all studies. In addition, the pooled median/mean of lung volume receiving ≥20 Gy and mean lung dose were relatively low in Asian studies compared to that in non-Asian studies. Interpretation: Asian patients are likely to have a higher incidence of pneumonitis than non-Asian patients, which appears to be due to the poor tolerance of lung to radiation. Nevertheless, these findings are based on observational studies and with significant heterogeneity, and need to be validated in future large prospective studies focusing on the subject.

	abstract = {Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most prevalent cancer in the world. The PD-1/PD-L1 pathway plays a crucial role in modulating immune response to cancer, and PD-L1 expression has been observed in tumor and immune cells within the tumor microenvironment of CRC. Thus, immunotherapy drugs, specifically checkpoint inhibitors, have been developed to target the PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway, thereby inhibiting the interaction between PD-1 and PD-L1 and restoring T-cell function in cancer cells. However, the emergence of resistance mechanisms can reduce the efficacy of these treatments. To counter this, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been used to improve the efficacy of CRC treatments. mAbs such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab are currently approved for CRC treatment. These antibodies impede immune checkpoint receptors, including PD-1/PD-L1, and their combination therapy shows promise in the treatment of advanced CRC. This review presents a concise overview of the use of the PD-1/PD-L1 blockade as a therapeutic strategy for CRC using monoclonal antibodies and combination therapies. Additionally, this article outlines the function of PD-1/PD-L1 as an immune response suppressor in the CRC microenvironment as well as the potential advantages of administering inflammatory agents for CRC treatment. Finally, this review analyzes the outcomes of clinical trials to examine the challenges of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapeutic resistance. © 2023},

	abstract = {Background: Platinum-etoposide chemotherapy combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has been recommended as the first-line standard treatment for extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). However, the effect of thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) on these patients is still unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TRT for ES-SCLC patients who responded to first-line ICIs and chemotherapy (CHT). Methods: Patients who received 4 to 6 cycles of ICIs and CHT as first-line therapy at three hospitals between 2018 and 2022 were included in the analysis. All patients were divided into two groups based on whether they received TRT as first-line treatment, and propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to ensure that the characteristics of two groups were well-balanced. The primary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), and the secondary endpoint was toxic effects. Results: A total of 276 patients were included, and the median follow-up time was 22.3 (range, 4.0-53.73) months. After PSM, 197 patients were further analysed, and 99 of whom received TRT. The baseline characteristics were well-balanced between patients in the TRT and non-TRT groups. There were significant differences in PFS between the TRT and non-TRT groups, with the median PFS of 10.76 and 7.63 months, respectively (P = 0.014). Significantly improved OS was observed in the TRT group (21.67 vs. 16.6 months, P = 0.009). In addition, the use of TRT was an independent prognostic factor for PFS and OS of ES-SCLC patients receiving ICIs plus CHT. In terms of safety, no significant increase of any grades adverse event (AE) (P = 0.874) and G3-4 AE (P = 0.909) was observed for patients receiving TRT. Radiation esophagitis, gastrointestinal and hematologic toxicities were the most common AEs in TRT group, which were tolerable. And high-dose radiotherapy was associated with higher incidence of pneumonitis. Conclusion: Addition of TRT showed significant survival benefits and well tolerability in ES-SCLC patients receiving platinum-etoposide CHT and ICIs, which could be a feasible first-line treatment strategy for ES-SCLC patients. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {The immune system uses various immune checkpoint axes to adjust responses, support homeostasis, and deter self-reactivity and autoimmunity. Nevertheless, non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) can use protective mechanisms to facilitate immune evasion, which leads to potentiated cancer survival and proliferation. In this light, many blocking anti-bodies have been developed to negatively regulate checkpoint molecules, in particular, programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) / PD-ligand 1 (L1), and bypass these immune suppressive mechanisms. Meanwhile, anti-PD-1 anti-bodies such as nivolumab, pembrolizumab, cemiplimab, and sintilimab have shown excellent competence in successfully inspiring immune responses versus NSCLC. Accordingly, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recently approved nivolumab (alone or in combination with ipilimumab) and pembrolizumab (alone or in combination with chemotherapy) as first-line treatment for advanced NSCLC patients. However, PD-1 blockade monotherapy remains inefficient in more than 60% of NSCLC patients, and many patients don't respond or acquire resistance to this modality. Also, toxicities related to anti-PD-1 anti-body have been progressively identified in clinical trials and oncology practice. Herein, we will outline the clinical benefits of PD-1 blockade therapy alone or in combination with other treatments (e.g., chemotherapy, radiotherapy, anti-angiogenic therapy) in NSCLC patients. Moreover, we will take a glimpse into the recently identified predictive biomarkers to determine patients most likely to suffer serious adverse events to decrease untoward toxicity risk and diminish treatment costs. © 2023 Elsevier GmbH},

	abstract = {Objective: Whether to continue administering immunotherapy to patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have experienced tumor progression remains controversial after immunotherapy. The aims were to explore survival outcomes after further immunotherapy post-progression and to determine the optimal combination therapy in such cases. Methods: Overall, 507 patients with NSCLC who underwent immunotherapy and experienced tumor progression were retrospectively divided into Immuno-combination and No-immuno groups according to whether additional combination therapy involving immunotherapy was administered post-progression. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated. Subgroup analyses were performed according to the different treatment regimens for patients in the Immuno-combination group. Results: After propensity score matching, there were 150 patients in the No-immuno group and 300 patients in the Immuno combination group. Superior PFS was observed in the Immuno-combination group compared with those in the No-immuno group (6-month PFS: 25.3 % vs. 60.6 %; 12-month PFS: 6.7 % vs. 24.4 %; P < 0.001). Similar intergroup differences were observed for OS (12-month OS: 22.3 % vs. 69.4 %; 18-month OS: 6.4 % vs. 40.4 %; P < 0.001). Superior PFS outcomes were observed in the Immuno+Antiangiogenic group compared with the Immuno+Chemo group (6-month PFS: 51.3 % vs. 71.5 %; 12-month PFS: 23.1 % vs. 25.7 %; P = 0.017). Similar differences in OS were observed between those same subgroups (12-month OS: 62.1 % vs. 77.9 %; 18-month OS: 33.3 % vs. 48.7 %; P = 0.006). Conclusion: Patients with NSCLC experiencing tumor progression post-immunotherapy can still benefit from further treatment, with immunotherapy combined with antiangiogenic therapy the most efficacious option. © 2024},

	abstract = {Background: Currently, chemotherapy plus immunotherapy followed by maintenance therapy with immune monotherapy is the preferred first-line treatment option for extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC), but with limited overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) benefits. The combination of antiangiogenic drugs with immunotherapy has shown encouraging anti-tumor activity and tolerability, with some degree of overcoming immune resistance. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of anlotinib plus anti-programmed cell death 1/ligand 1 (anti-PD-1/PD-L1) antibodies as maintenance therapy after first-line chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy in ES-SCLC. Methods: Between June 2020 and December 2021, 12 patients with newly diagnosed ES-SCLC in the First Affiliated Hospital of Army Medical University were retrospectively analyzed. All patients without disease progression after 4–6 cycles of first-line platinum-containing chemotherapy plus anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies received anlotinib (12 mg oral/day, days 1–14, followed by 1 week off, every 3 weeks per cycle) plus anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies as maintenance therapy. Several patients underwent chest radiotherapy (intensity-modulated radiotherapy using a 6 MV X-ray) without disease progression before maintenance therapy. The effectiveness and safety of anlotinib plus anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies as maintenance therapy after first-line chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy in ES-SCLC were evaluated. Results: The median follow-up time was 31.1 months. During first-line treatment (including maintenance therapy), one patient achieved a complete response, eight patients achieved a partial response (PR), and three patients had stable disease, with an objective response rate of 75.0% and a disease control rate of 100.0%. During maintenance therapy with anlotinib plus anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies, 50.0% of patients achieved further lesion remission on the basis of the prior initial treatment, of which one patient achieved a PR. The median PFS was 13.6 [95% confidence interval (CI): 11.2–15.6] months, and the median OS was 19.5 (95% CI: 14.5–24.5) months. Treatment-related any grade and grade 3–4 adverse events (AEs) were reported in 100.0% and 58.3% of patients, respectively. No life-threatening AEs were observed. Grade 3–4 AEs included leukocytopenia (58.3%, 7/12), thrombocytopenia (33.3%, 4/12), nausea (33.3%, 4/12), anemia (16.7%, 2/12), and fatigue (8.3%, 1/12). All AEs during maintenance therapy were tolerated and were regarded as grade 1–2, with the majority being fatigue, nausea, rash, and hemoptysis. Conclusions: The combination of anlotinib with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies demonstrated encouraging effectiveness and safety in treating patients with ES-SCLC, suggesting that it may be a preferred option for maintenance therapy after first-line chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy. © Journal of Thoracic Disease.

	abstract = {Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is characterized by aggressive proliferation kinetics, early development of distant metastasis, and an overall dismal prognosis. Addition of the PD-L1 antibodies atezolizumab and durvalumab to platinum-/etoposide-based chemotherapy improves overall survival and represents the first change in therapeutic standards for almost 30 years in metastasized SCLC (stage IV or extensive disease [ED] according to the Veterans Administration Lung Study Group [VALG]). Although the numeric gains in median overall survival are limited (approximately 3 months), the addition of a PD-L1 antibody led to a clinically relevant increase in 3‑year overall survival from 5.8 to 17.6%. Therefore, anti-PD-L1-based immunochemotherapy represents the current standard for ED-SCLC and should be applied irrespective of PD-L1 expression and other biomarkers. Standard of care in curatively treatable SCLC limited to the hemithorax (limited stage [LD] according to VALG) remains is accelerated concurrent chemoradiotherapy. The recently presented findings of the ADRIATIC study demonstrate a benefit from consolidation therapy with the PD-L1 antibody durvalumab. A corresponding expansion of the drugʼs approval can be expected. In conclusion, treatment of SCLC remains a challenge and improvements in therapeutic standards are much slower than those seen in NSCLC. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Medizin Verlag GmbH, ein Teil von Springer Nature 2024.},

	abstract = {Background: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) has a tendency towards recurrence and limited survival. Standard-of-care in 1st-line is platinum-etoposide chemotherapy plus atezolizumab or durvalumab, based on landmark clinical trials. Methods: IFCT-1905 CLINATEZO is a nationwide, non-interventional, retrospective study of patients with extensive-SCLC receiving atezolizumab plus chemotherapy as part of French Early Access Program. Objectives were to analyse effectiveness, safety and subsequent treatments. Results: The population analyzed included 518 patients who received atezolizumab in 65 participating centers. There were 66.2% male, mean age was 65.7 years; 89.1% had a performance status (PS) 0/1 and 26.6% brain metastases. Almost all (95.9%) were smokers. Fifty-five (10.6%) received at least 1 previous treatment. Median number of atezolizumab injections was 7.0 (range [1.0–48.0]) for a median duration of 4.9 months (95% CI 4.5–5.1). Atezolizumab was continued beyond progression in 122 patients (23.6%) for a median duration of 1.9 months (95% CI: [1.4–2.3]). Best objective response was complete and partial in 19 (3.9%) and 378 (77.1%) patients. Stable disease was observed in 50 patients (10.2%). Median follow-up was 30.8 months (95% CI: [29.9–31.5]). Median overall survival (OS), 12-, 24-month OS rates were 11.3 months (95% CI: [10.1–12.4]), 46.7% (95% CI [42.3–50.9]) and 21.2% (95% CI [17.7–24.8]). Median real-world progression-free survival, 6-, 12-month rates were 5.2 months (95% CI [5.0–5.4]), 37.5% (95% CI [33.3–41.7]) and 15.2% (95% CI [12.2–18.6]). For patients with PS 0/1, median OS was 12.2 months (95% CI [11.0–13.5]). For patients with previous treatment, median OS was 14.9 months (95% CI [10.1–21.5]). Three-hundred-and-twenty-six patients (66.4%) received subsequent treatment and 27 (5.2%) were still under atezolizumab at date of last news. Conclusions: IFCT-1905 CLINATEZO shows reproductibility, in real-life, of IMpower-133 survival outcomes, possibly attributed to selection of patients fit for this regimen, adoption of pragmatic approaches, including concurrent radiotherapy and treatment beyond progression. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) represents one of the most complex challenges in the oncological field, with a very slow advancement in research, contrary to the rapid evolutionary of the disease. For nearly two years, the mainstay of treatment for extensive-stage disease (ES-SCLC) has been the combination of platinum-based chemotherapy and immunotherapy, following the approval of atezolizumab and subsequently durvalumab, based on a modest, but significant improvement in overall survival compared to chemotherapy alone. The poor prognosis after the failure of first-line treatment explains the need to maximize the duration and efficacy of up-front systemic therapies, in particular, the emerging role of radiotherapy, also in ES-SCLC. On 10 November 2022, a meeting concerning the integrated treatment of patients with ES-SCLC was held in Rome and was attended by 12 specialists in oncology and radiotherapy from various centers in Lazio, under the direction of Federico Cappuzzo, Emilio Bria and Sara Ramella. The aim of the meeting was to share their clinical experience and to provide a series of practical indications in order to support physicians in the correct integration between first-line chemo-immunotherapy and radiotherapy treatments in ES-SCLC. © 2023 Il Pensiero Scientifico Editore s.r.l..

	abstract = {Purpose: Treatment for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer consists of concurrent chemoradiation followed by immunotherapy. Though this combination has been shown to have a benefit in both progression-free survival and overall survival, treatment is often limited by the development of pneumonitis. One way to mitigate toxicity is through adaptive radiation therapy, which does not currently have a standardized implementation in clinical practice. Methods and Materials: A single-center retrospective review of patients with locally advanced stage III or oligometastatic stage IV non-small cell lung cancer who were treated with chemoradiation with concurrent or subsequent immunotherapy from 2015 to 2020 was performed. Patients were stratified based on having 1 or more offline adapted plan. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between dose-volume histogram values and common toxicities experienced during this treatment, including pneumonitis and esophagitis. Results: Twenty-five patients were included in the final analysis: 10 with adapted plans (AP), and 15 with nonadapted plans (NAP). Mean age at onset was 74 years. The most common histology was adenocarcinoma (N = 13). Five patients experienced pneumonitis: 2 in AP and 3 in NAP. Mann-Whitney U test of gross tumor volume sizes between AP (346.2 ± 269.7 cm3) and NAP (153.1 ± 99.6 cm3) was significant (P = .019). Multiple linear regression analysis with adjustment for covariates of pneumonitis versus plan adaptation (P = .106) and esophagitis versus plan adaptation (P = .59) did not demonstrate a significant difference in toxicity between the adapted and nonadaptive patients. Conclusions: Despite similar toxicities in both groups, the gross tumor volume size in the AP was more than double compared with NAP, suggesting that adaptive techniques provide a method for patients with larger target volumes to be treated without an observed difference in pneumonitis rates. These results suggest adaptive radiation therapy may have a role in mitigating toxicity experience from chemoradiation and immunotherapy and warrants further investigation. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Objective: To investigate the role of consolidative thoracic radiation (TRT) in extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) receiving first-line chemo-immunotherapy followed by immunotherapy maintenance. Patients and methods: Outcomes of patients without disease progression after first-line chemotherapy were retrospectively reviewed (January 2020 to December 2021). Based on TRT or not, patients were allocated to TRT group or non-TRT group. Progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and local-recurrence free survival (LRFS) were calculated by the Kaplan–Meier method and compared by log-rank test. Results: Of 100 patients, 47 received TRT and 53 non-TRT. The median follow-up was 20.3 months. The median PFS and OS in TRT were 9.1 months and 21.8 months, versus 8.8 months (p = 0.93) and 24.3 months (p = 0.63), respectively, in non-TRT. The median LRFS time in TRT was not reached, but significantly longer than 10.8 months in non-TRT (HR = 0.27, p < 0.01). Second-line chemotherapy significantly prolonged survival compared to that with chemo-free patients (mOS: 24.5 vs. 21.4 months, p = 0.026). The subgroup analysis showed a trend of patients with brain metastases benefit from TRT (21.8 versus 13.7 months, HR 0.61, p = 0.38) while liver metastases did not. Of 47 patients with TRT, only 10.6% of patients experienced grade 3 radiation-induced pneumonitis, while no grade 4 or 5 adverse events occurred. Conclusion: Consolidative TRT in the period of immunotherapy maintenance followed first-line chemo-immunotherapy did not prolong OS and PFS but associated with improved LRFS in ES-SCLC. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly aggressive neuroendocrine tumor that is prone to spread extensively. Compared to non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), SCLC treatment progresses slowly. Although SCLC is highly sensitive to chemotherapy during the initial treatment, most patients still experience resistance and recurrence after receiving chemotherapy. A meta-analysis demonstrated that thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) improves overall survival in SCLC. The results of the CALGB and CONVERT trials provide evidence for the efficacy of once-daily high-dose TRT. TRT at 60 Gy administered twice daily significantly improved survival without increasing toxicity. The long-standing debate over the optimal timing of radiotherapy has not been fully resolved. SBRT has excellent local control rates and is a safe and effective treatment option for patients with stage I or II SCLC. Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) is used to reduce treatment-related neurotoxicity to the extent that there has been a recent discussion on whether magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) monitoring can replace PCI. Radiotherapy combined with immunotherapy significantly improves the survival rate of patients with NSCLC; however, its clinical effectiveness has not been systematically explored in patients with SCLC. Therefore, we summarize the evolving therapeutic strategies, (TRT for limited stage-SCLC and consolidative TRT for extensive stage-SCLC) and improved radiotherapy techniques (role of SBRT in stage I or II node-negative SCLC, progress of PCI, and stereotactic radiosurgery), and discuss the possibilities and prospects of radiotherapy combined with immunotherapy for SCLC. © 2023 The Authors.

	abstract = {Background and rationale. The therapeutic interventions against lung cancer are currently based on a fully personalized approach to the disease with considerable improvement of patients’ outcome. Alongside continuous scientific progresses and research investments, massive technologic efforts, innovative challenges, and consolidated achievements together with research investments are at the bases of the engineering and manufacturing revolution that allows a significant gain in clinical setting. Aim and methods. The scope of this review is thus to focus, rather than on the biologic traits, on the analysis of the precision sensors and novel generation materials, as semiconductors, which are below the clinical development of personalized diagnosis and treatment. In this perspective, a careful revision and analysis of the state of the art of the literature and experimental knowledge is presented. Results. Novel materials are being used in the development of personalized diagnosis and treatment for lung cancer. Among them, semiconductors are used to analyze volatile cancer compounds and allow early disease diagnosis. Moreover, they can be used to generate MEMS which have found an application in advanced imaging techniques as well as in drug delivery devices. Conclusions. Overall, these issues represent critical issues only partially known and generally underestimated by the clinical community. These novel micro-technology-based biosensing devices, based on the use of molecules at atomic concentrations, are crucial for clinical innovation since they have allowed the recent significant advances in cancer biology deciphering as well as in disease detection and therapy. There is an urgent need to create a stronger dialogue between technologists, basic researchers, and clinicians to address all scientific and manufacturing efforts towards a real improvement in patients’ outcome. Here, great attention is focused on their application against lung cancer, from their exploitations in translational research to their application in diagnosis and treatment development, to ensure early diagnosis and better clinical outcomes. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Lung cancer is the second-most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. The most common histological type is non-small-cell lung cancer, accounting for 85% of all lung cancer cases. About one out of three new cases of non-small-cell lung cancer are diagnosed at a locally advanced stage—mainly stage III—consisting of a widely heterogeneous group of patients presenting significant differences in terms of tumor volume, local diffusion, and lymph nodal involvement. Stage III NSCLC therapy is based on the pivotal role of multimodal treatment, including surgery, radiotherapy, and a wide-ranging option of systemic treatments. Radical surgery is indicated in the case of hilar lymphnodal involvement or single station mediastinal ipsilateral involvement, possibly after neoadjuvant chemotherapy; the best appropriate treatment for multistation mediastinal lymph node involvement still represents a matter of debate. Although the main scope of treatments in this setting is potentially curative, the overall survival rates are still poor, ranging from 36% to 26% and 13% in stages IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC, respectively. The aim of this article is to provide an up-to-date, comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art treatments for stage III non-small-cell lung cancer. © 2023 by the authors.},

Patients and Methods: Split-course hypo-RT and hypoboost combined with concurrent chemotherapy was administered at three dose levels (DL), using a stepwise dose-escalation protocol. The sophisticated esophagus-sparing technique was implemented to restrict the dose to the esophagus. Patients who did not experience disease progression or unresolved ≥grade 2 (G2+) toxicities after RT received cICI. Each DL aimed to treat six patients. The MTFD was defined as the highest DL at which ≤2 patients of the six who were treated experienced treatment-related G3+ toxicity and ≤1 patient experienced G4+ toxicity within 12 months post-RT. Results: Eighteen patients were enrolled, with six patients in each DL. All patients completed hypo-RT and concurrent chemotherapy, and 16 (88.9%) received at least one infusion of cICI, with a median of 10 infusions. Within the 12-month assessment period, one patient in DL1 experienced G3 pneumonitis, and one patient in DL3 developed G3 tracheobronchitis. The MTFD was not reached. The objective response rate was 100%. With a median follow-up of 20.9 months, the 1-year overall survival and progression-free survival rates were 94.4% and 83.3%, respectively. Conclusions: Utilizing the split-course hypo-RT and hypoboost approach, a fraction dose of 5 Gy to a total dose of 60 Gy, combined with concurrent chemotherapy and subsequent cICI, was well tolerated and yielded a promising objective response rate and survival outcomes.  © 2024 American Association for Cancer Research.},

After more than three decades without clinical advances, research on immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) combined with platinum-based chemotherapy has led to the first treatment breakthrough, establishing a new standard for the first-line treatment of ES-SCLC. Further studies have extensively evaluated small-molecule antiangiogenic drugs, PARP inhibitors, as well as lurbinectedin in SCLC and have demonstrated some benefit, although no breakthroughs have been made. In addition, newer therapeutic strategies with targeted agents, novel chemotherapeutics and immunotherapies are evolving as they are being actively explored and hold promise for patients with this disease. Notably, the preliminary identification of SCLC molecular subtypes driven by the expression of dominant transcription factors with RNA sequencing profiles has made it possible to identify molecularly tailored therapeutic approaches, which increases the potential for individualized precision treatment of SCLC.

	abstract = {Introduction: Nearly 1% to 2% of NSCLCs harbor RET fusions. Characterization of this rare population is still incomplete. Methods: This retrospective multicenter study included patients with any-stage RET positive (RET+) NSCLC from 31 cancer centers. Molecular profiling included DNA/RNA sequencing or fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses. Clinicobiological features and treatment outcomes (per investigator) with surgery, chemotherapy (CT), immune checkpoint blockers (ICBs), CT-ICB, multityrosine kinase inhibitors, and RET inhibitors (RETis) were evaluated. Results: For 218 patients included between February 2012 and April 2022, median age was 63 years, 56% were females, 93% had adenocarcinoma, and 41% were smokers. The most frequent fusion partner was KIF5B (72%). Median tumor mutational burden was 2.5 (range: 1–4) mutations per megabase, and median programmed death-ligand 1 expression was 10% (range: 0%–55%). The most common metastatic sites were the lung (50%), bone (43%), and pleura (40%). Central nervous system metastases were found at diagnosis of advanced NSCLC in 21% of the patients and at last follow-up or death in 31%. Overall response rate and median progression-free survival were 55% and 8.7 months with platinum doublet, 26% and 3.6 months with single-agent CT, 46% and 9.6 months with CT-ICB, 23% and 3.1 months with ICB, 37% and 3 months with multityrosine kinase inhibitor, and 76% and 16.2 months with RETi, respectively. Median overall survival was longer in patients treated with RETi versus no RETi (50.6 mo [37.7–72.1] versus 16.3 mo [12.7–28.8], p < 0.0001). Conclusions: Patients with RET+ NSCLC have mainly thoracic and bone disease and low tumor mutational burden and programmed death-ligand 1 expression. RETi markedly improved survival, whereas ICB may be active in selected patients. © 2023 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer},

	abstract = {Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICIs) therapy has advanced significantly in treating malignant tumors, though most ‘cold’ tumors show no response. This resistance mainly arises from the varied immune evasion mechanisms. Hence, understanding the transformation from ‘cold’ to ‘hot’ tumors is essential in developing effective cancer treatments. Furthermore, tumor immune profiling is critical, requiring a range of diagnostic techniques and biomarkers for evaluation. The success of immunotherapy relies on T cells’ ability to recognize and eliminate tumor cells. In ‘cold’ tumors, the absence of T cell infiltration leads to the ineffectiveness of ICI therapy. Addressing these challenges, especially the impairment in T cell activation and homing, is crucial to enhance ICI therapy’s efficacy. Concurrently, strategies to convert ‘cold’ tumors into ‘hot’ ones, including boosting T cell infiltration and adoptive therapies such as T cell-recruiting bispecific antibodies and Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cells, are under extensive exploration. Thus, identifying key factors that impact tumor T cell infiltration is vital for creating effective treatments targeting ‘cold’ tumors.

	abstract = {Purpose: In the era of immunotherapy, the treatment for bulky, locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC) remains challenging. This study explored the feasibility of induction immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) plus chemotherapy before definitive chemoradiation therapy (CRT) for bulky LA-NSCLC. Methods and Materials: Patients with bulky, unresectable stage III NSCLC (primary tumor ≥5 cm in greatest dimension or metastatic lymph nodes ≥2 cm in shortest diameter) receiving ICIs and chemotherapy before CRT from 2018 to 2022 were identified. Survival outcomes and toxic effects were analyzed. Radiation therapy plans on computed tomography images before and after 2 cycles of induction chemoimmunotherapy were simulated to evaluate dosimetric outcomes. Results: Seventy-five patients were included. One- and 2-year overall-survival (OS) rates were 91.5% (95% CI, 85.2%-98.3%) and 75.1% (95% CI, 64.1%-88.0%), respectively. One- and 2-year progression-free-survival (PFS) rates were 85.8% (95% CI, 78.0%-94.4%) and 64.2% (95% CI, 52.5%-78.6%), respectively. Median OS was not reached (NR). Median PFS was 30.6 months (95% CI, 25.9 months to NR). Grade 2 and ≥3 pneumonitis occurred in 26.7% and 9.3% of patients, respectively. Grade ≥3 pneumonitis was significantly associated with poorer OS (P = .003) and PFS (P = .018). Treatment discontinuation was significantly associated with shorter OS (P = .023) and PFS (P = .047). Patients with consolidation ICIs exhibited numerically better OS than those without consolidation ICIs (2-year OS, 85.8% vs 64.2%; P = .170). The objective response rate was 76.1% for induction treatment and 86.7% for induction treatment plus CRT. The disease control rate after 2 cycles of induction therapy was significantly greater than after 4 (P = .046) or more cycles (P = .025). Simulated radiation plans indicated that all target volumes, mean lung dose, and volume of lung parenchyma receiving ≥5 Gy, ≥20 Gy, and ≥30 Gy significantly decreased after 2 cycles (all P < .005). Conclusions: Two cycles of induction ICIs plus chemotherapy before definitive CRT were feasible for bulky LA-NSCLC, with significant tumor reduction and normal lung protection. Further investigations on CRT combined with induction and consolidation ICIs are warranted. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {The PACIFIC trial led to a new standard of care for patients with locally advanced lung cancer, but real-world practice has demonstrated that immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) pneumonitis can lead to significant clinical complications. This study aimed to examine the clinical predictors, outcomes, and healthcare utilization data in patients who received consolidation durvalumab. Using the Alberta Immunotherapy Database, NSCLC patients who received durvalumab in Alberta, Canada, from January 2018 to December 2021 were retrospectively evaluated. We examined incidence and predictive values of severe pneumonitis, with overall survival (OS) and time-to-treatment failure (TTF) using exploratory multivariate analyses. Of 189 patients, 91% were ECOG 0–1 and 85% had a partial response from chemoradiation prior to durvalumab. Median TTF and OS were not reached; 1-year OS was 82%. An amount of 26% developed any grade of pneumonitis; 9% had ≥grade 3 pneumonitis. Male gender and a pre-existing autoimmune condition were associated with severe pneumonitis. V20 was associated with any grade of pneumonitis. Pneumonitis development was found to be an independent risk factor for worse OS (p = 0.038) and TTF (p = 0.007). Our results suggest clinical and dosimetric predictive factors of durvalumab-associated pneumonitis. These results affirm the importance of careful patient selection for safe completion of consolidation durvalumab in real-world LA-NSCLC population. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Background/Aim: Chemo-immunotherapy, including the programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibody, is an effective treatment for patients with extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). However, no biomarker has been established for the prediction of chemo-immunotherapy. Therefore, we investigated the potential of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) as a predictive marker. Patients and Methods: Forty-six patients with ES-SCLC who received 18F-FDG-PET immediately before combined platinum-based chemotherapy with PD-L1 blockade as a first-line treatment were eligible, and the maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax), metabolic tumor volume (MTV), and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) on 18F-FDG uptake were evaluated. Results: PD-L1 and tumor infiltrative lymphocytes (TILs) were immunohistochemically analyzed in 36 of the 46 patients. A high MTV was significantly associated with poor performance status and low albumin levels, and there was a significant association between low albumin and high TLG. Univariate analysis identified sex, Brinkman index, and MTV as significant predictors of progression-free survival (PFS), and sex, SUVmax, MTV, and TLG as significant factors of overall survival (OS). Multivariate analysis revealed that sex, Brinkman index, and MTV were independent prognostic factors for PFS, and sex, SUVmax, MTV, and TLG were significant predictors of OS. SUVmax was significantly higher in patients with positive PD-L1 expression than in those with negative expression but was not significantly different between positive and negative TILs. Moreover, the levels of MTV and TLG were not closely associated with the levels of PD-L1 and TILs. Conclusion: MTV or TLG metabolic tumor activity is suitable for the prediction of chemo-immunotherapy outcomes in patients with ES-SCLC. © 2024 International Institute of Anticancer Research.

	abstract = {Lung cancer is managed using conventional therapies, including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or a combination of both. Each of these therapies has its own limitations, such as the indiscriminate killing of normal as well as cancer cells, the solubility of the chemotherapeutic drugs, rapid clearance of the drugs from circulation before reaching the tumor site, the resistance of cancer cells to radiation, and over-sensitization of normal cells to radiation. Other treatment modalities include gene therapy, immunological checkpoint inhibitors, drug repurposing, and in situ cryo-immune engineering (ICIE) strategy. Nanotechnology has come to the rescue to overcome many shortfalls of conventional therapies. Some of the nano-formulated chemotherapeutic drugs, as well as nanoparticles and nanostructures with surface modifications, have been used for effective cancer cell killing and radio sensitization, respectively. Nano-enabled drug delivery systems act as cargo to deliver the sensitizer molecules specifically to the tumor cells, thereby enabling the radiation therapy to be more effective. In this review, we have discussed the different conventional chemotherapies and radiation therapies used for inhibiting lung cancer. We have also discussed the improvement in chemotherapy and radiation sensitization using nanoparticles. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Lung cancer continues to be the most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide. In the past decade, with the implementation of lung cancer screening programs and advances in surgical and nonsurgical therapies, the survival of patients with lung cancer has increased, as has the number of imaging studies that these patients undergo. However, most patients with lung cancer do not undergo surgical resection, because they have comorbid disease or lung cancer in an advanced stage at diagnosis. Nonsurgical therapies have continued to evolve with a growing range of systemic and targeted therapies, and there has been an associated evolution in the imaging findings encountered at follow-up examinations after such therapies (e.g., with respect to posttreatment changes, treatment complications, and recurrent tumor). This AJR Expert Panel Narrative Review describes the current status of nonsurgical therapies for lung cancer and their expected and unexpected imaging manifestations. The goal is to provide guidance to radiologists regarding imaging assessment after such therapies, focusing mainly on non-small cell lung cancer. Covered therapies include systemic therapy (conventional chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy), radiotherapy, and thermal ablation. © 2023 American Roentgen Ray Society.

	abstract = {Background: The CREST study showed that the addition of thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) could improve the survival rate in patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC), but whether TRT can bring survival benefit in the era of immunotherapy remains controversial. This study aimed to explore the efficacy and safety of adding TRT to the combination of PD-L1 inhibitors and chemotherapy. Methods: The patients who received durvalumab or atezolizumab combined with chemotherapy as the first-line treatment of ES-SCLC from January 2019 to December 2021 were enrolled. They were divided into two groups, based on whether they received TRT or not. Propensity score matching (PSM) with a 1:1 ratio was performed. The primary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and safety. Results: A total of 211 patients with ES-SCLC were enrolled, of whom 70 (33.2%) patients received standard therapy plus TRT as first-line treatment, and 141 (66.8%) patients in the control group received PD-L1 inhibitors plus chemotherapy. After PSM, a total of 57 pairs of patients were enrolled in the analysis. In all patients, the median PFS (mPFS) in the TRT and non-TRT group was 9.5 and 7.2 months, respectively, with HR = 0.59 (95%CI 0.39–0.88, p = 0.009). The median OS (mOS) in the TRT group was also significantly longer than that in the non-TRT group (24.1 months vs. 18.5 months, HR = 0.53, 95%CI 0.31–0.89, p = 0.016). Multivariable analysis showed that baseline liver metastasis and the number of metastases ≥ 3 were independent prognostic factors for OS. Addition of TRT increased the incidence of treatment-related pneumonia (p = 0.018), most of which were grade 1–2. Conclusions: Addition of TRT to durvalumab or atezolizumab plus chemotherapy significantly improves survival in ES-SCLC. Although it may leads to increased incidence of treatment-related pneumonia, a majority of the cases can be relieved after symptomatic treatment. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Objective: The role of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in treating extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) has been controversial. This study aimed to comprehensively analyze the efficacy of PCI for the treatment of ES-SCLC under active brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) surveillance. Methods: Patients with ES-SCLC with no brain metastases (BM) confirmed by MRI at the time of diagnosis who responded well to first-line chemoimmunotherapy at three general hospitals were retrospectively included. Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and cumulative incidence of BM were compared between patients who underwent PCI and those who did not. Results: In total, 66 consecutive patients treated between March 2019 and December 2021 were included in our dataset. Seventeen patients underwent PCI (PCI group) and 49 patients did not (non-PCI group). In comparison with the non-PCI group, PCI did not provide OS (median OS: 18.53 vs. 17.35 months, p = 0.28) or PFS (median PFS: 8.61 vs. 7.56 months, p = 0.41) benefits. When death was counted as a competing risk, the difference in the cumulative incidence rate of BM was not statistically significant (1-year: 12.79% vs. 38.09%; p = 0.14). Conclusion: Compared to active MRI surveillance, first-line chemoimmunotherapy followed by PCI did not improve the prognosis of patients with ES-SCLC. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the therapeutic effects of PCI following chemoimmunotherapy. © 2023 The Authors.

	abstract = {Immune-checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized cancer therapy, yet many patients either do not derive any benefit from treatment or develop a resistance to checkpoint inhibitors. Intrinsic resistance can result from neoantigen depletion, defective antigen presentation, PD-L1 downregulation, immune-checkpoint ligand upregulation, immunosuppression, and tumor cell phenotypic changes. On the other hand, extrinsic resistance involves acquired upregulation of inhibitory immune-checkpoints, leading to T-cell exhaustion. Current data suggest that PD-1, CTLA-4, and LAG-3 upregulation limits the efficacy of single-agent immune-checkpoint inhibitors. Ongoing clinical trials are investigating novel immune-checkpoint targets to avoid or overcome resistance. This review provides an in-depth analysis of the evolving landscape of potentially targetable immune-checkpoints in cancer. We highlight their biology, emphasizing the current understanding of resistance mechanisms and focusing on promising strategies that are under investigation. We also summarize current results and ongoing clinical trials in this crucial field that could once again revolutionize outcomes for cancer patients. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Purpose: Chemoradiotherapy (CRT) combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) is the standard of care for patients with unresectable and locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer. This study aimed to determine whether the addition of ICIs to CRT is associated with an increased risk of pneumonitis. Methods and Materials: The PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases were searched for eligible studies published between January 1, 2015, and July 31, 2023. The outcome of interest was the incidence rate of pneumonitis. A random-effects model was used for statistical analysis. Results: A total of 185 studies with 24,527 patients were included. The pooled rate of grade ≥2 pneumonitis for CRT plus ICIs was significantly higher than that for CRT alone (29.6%; 95% CI, 25.7%-33.6% vs 20.2%; 95% CI, 17.7%-22.8%; P <.0001) but not that of grade ≥3 (5.7%; 95% CI, 4.8%-6.6% vs 5.6%; 95% CI, 4.7%-6.5%; P =.64) or grade 5 (0.1%; 95% CI, 0.0%-0.2% vs 0.3%; 95% CI, 0.1%-0.4%; P =.68). The results from the subgroup analyses of prospective studies, retrospective studies, Asian and non-Asian studies, concurrent CRT (cCRT), and durvalumab consolidation were comparable to the overall results. However, CRT or cCRT plus PD-1 inhibitors not only significantly increased the incidence of grade ≥2 but also that of grade ≥3 pneumonitis compared to CRT alone or cCRT plus PD-L1 inhibitors. Conclusions: Compared with CRT alone, durvalumab consolidation after CRT appears to be associated with a higher incidence of moderate pneumonitis and CRT plus PD-1 inhibitors with an increased risk of severe pneumonitis. Nevertheless, these findings are based on observational studies and need to be validated in future large head-to-head studies. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.},

Methods: The subjects of this single-center retrospective analysis were 14 patients who underwent salvage surgery after ICI treatment between May, 2017 and April, 2023 at our institute. We reviewed the comprehensive surgical outcomes, including operative procedures, intraoperative findings, and postoperative morbidities. Overall survival (OS) was calculated using a Kaplan–Meier estimation. Results: The initial clinical stage before medical treatment (c-stage) was stage III in eight patients, stage IV in five patients, and one patient had postoperative lung cancer recurrence. The indications for surgery were as follows: local control for relapse or residual tumor in ten patients and discontinuation of systemic therapy because of treatment-related complications in four patients. The surgical modes were segmentectomy (n = 1), lobectomy (n = 4), bilobectomy (n = 3), pneumonectomy (n = 6), and bronchoplasty (n = 7). Grade 3 or higher postoperative morbidities were observed in six patients, including only one case of 90-day mortality. Conclusions: Our series demonstrated that the surgical outcome of salvage extended surgery after ICI therapy may be positive with careful selection of the procedure and indication. © The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.},

Materials and Methods: We retrospectively assessed adults with NSCLC who received pembrolizumab for R/R disease between January 2016 to January 2023. Primary objective was to estimate OS and PFS in this cohort compared to historical outcomes. Secondary objective was to compare OS and PFS among subgroups. Results: Fifty patients were evaluated. Median follow-up time was 11.3 months (2.9-38.2). OS was 10.6 months (95% CI, 8.8-19.2); 1-year OS rate 49% (95% CI, 36 - 67%). PFS was 6.1 months (95% CI, 4.7-9.0); 1-year PFS rate 25% (95% CI, 15%-42%). Current smokers had significantly better median OS/PFS as compared to former smokers (NA vs. 10.5 and 9.9 vs. 6.0 months, respectively). The addition of chemotherapy demonstrated an OS benefit (median OS 12.9 vs. 6.0 months) but was not statistically significant. Conclusion: Patients with R/R NSCLC represent a distinct cohort with inferior survival outcomes when compared to those with de novo stage IV disease treated with pembrolizumab-based regimens. Based on our findings, we recommend oncologists exercise caution when considering checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy in the front-line setting for R/R NSCLC, regardless of PD-L1 expression. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) carries a dismal prognosis. The benefit of consolidative thoracic radiotherapy (TR) after first-line chemoimmunotherapy with PD-L1 inhibitors in this setting remains unclear. As TR can improve overall survival (OS) after conventional chemotherapy, we retrospectively analyzed OS of an inhouse cohort treated either with TR or with chemoimmunotherapy alone. Methods: A total of 41 patients treated with chemoimmunotherapy with PD-L1 inhibitors (atezolizumab or durvalumab) for ES-SCLC at our hospital since 2019 were analyzed. TR was administered in 10 fractions of 3 Gy. Patient characteristics, number of immunotherapy cycles received, brain irradiation, and presence of hepatic and cerebral metastasis at diagnosis were assessed. Primary endpoint was OS after first diagnosis. Results: Consolidative TR was associated with a significantly longer OS than systemic therapy alone (1-year OS 78.6% and 2‑year OS 37.1% vs. 1‑year OS 39.7% and 2 years not reached, p = 0.019). With regard to radiotherapy indication, survival at 1 year was 88.9% (log-rank p = 0.016) for patients receiving consolidative TR. For patients receiving TR in case of progression, 1‑year survival was 66.7%. Hepatic and cerebral metastasis at first diagnosis had no significant effect on OS. Conclusion: TR was significantly associated with longer OS. The survival benefit of TR was most pronounced for consolidative radiotherapy after initial chemoimmunotherapy compared to TR in case of progression. Although retrospective findings need to be interpreted with caution, in the absence of prospective data, our findings provide a basis for offering consolidative TR in the era of chemoimmunotherapy. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Purpose: The objective of this study was to describe the patterns of failure, frequency of low-volume relapse (LVR), and candidacy for ablative therapy at time of disease progression (PD) after chemoradiation and consolidative immunotherapy (CRT + ICI) in patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer. Methods and Materials: We identified 229 consecutive patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer treated with CRT + ICI between October 2017 and December 2021 at a single institution. PD was classified as isolated locoregional failure (LRF), isolated distant failure (DF), or synchronous LRF + DF. Any LRF was subclassified as in-field failure, marginal failure, or out-of-field failure. LVR was defined as 3 or fewer sites of PD in any number of organs. Ablative candidates were defined as having 5 or fewer sites of PD radiographically amenable to high-dose radiation or surgery. Time-to-event data were calculated using cumulative incidence analysis and Kaplan-Meier methods. Multivariable Cox modeling was used to examine the correlations between characteristics of relapse and postprogression survival. Results: Of the 229 patients, 119 (52%) had PD. Of these 119 patients, 20 (21%) had isolated LRF, 28 (24%) had synchronous LRF + DF, and 71 (60%) had isolated DF. Of the 48 patients with any LRF, 28 (58%) had in-field failure, 10 (21%) marginal failure, and 10 (21%) out-of-field failure. The cumulative incidence of LRF and DF was 13% (95% CI, 9.2%-18%) and 32% (95% CI, 26%-38%) at 1 year and 19% (95% CI, 14%-24%) and 39% (95% CI, 33%-46%) at 2 years, respectively. Overall, 64 patients (54%) were considered to have LVR. At time of PD, 60 patients (50%) were eligible for ablative therapy. Patients with LVR had longer median survival versus with high-volume relapse (37.4 vs 15.2 months, P < .001). On multivariable analysis, LVR (hazard ratio, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.18-0.56; P < .001) was associated with improved postprogression survival. Conclusions: After CRT + ICI, approximately half of patients experience LVR at time of PD and are candidates for ablative therapies. Prospective trials are needed to validate the optimal treatment strategy for LVR. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Until the advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), definitive radiotherapy (RT) concurrently with chemotherapy was recommended for unresectable, locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC). The trimodality paradigm with consolidation ICIs following definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy has been the standard of care since the PACIFIC trial. Preclinical evidence has demonstrated the role of RT in the cancer-immune cycle and the synergistic effect of RT combined with ICIs (iRT). However, RT exerts a double-edged effect on immunity and the combination strategy still could be optimized in many areas. In the context of LA-NSCLC, optimized RT modality, choice, timing, and duration of ICIs, care for oncogenic addicted tumors, patient selection, and novel combination strategies require further investigation. Targeting these blind spots, novel approaches are being investigated to cross the borders of PACIFIC. We discussed the development history of iRT and summarized the updated rationale for the synergistic effect. We then summarized the available research data on the efficacy and toxicity of iRT in LA-NSCLC for cross-trial comparisons to eliminate barriers. Progression during and after ICIs consolidation therapy has been regarded as a distinct resistance scenario from primary or secondary resistance to ICIs, the subsequent management of which has also been discussed. Finally, based on unmet needs, we probed into the challenges, strategies, and auspicious orientations to optimize iRT in LA-NSCLC. In this review, we focus on the underlying mechanisms and recent advances of iRT with an emphasis on future challenges and directions that warrant further investigation. Taken together, iRT is a proven and potential strategy in LA-NSCLC, with multiple promising approaches to further improve the efficacy.

ICI have been approved for a wide range of cancers, including malignant melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, head and neck cancer, Hodgkin's disease, small-cell lung cancer, malignant pleural mesothelioma, gastric cancer, esophageal cancer, breast cancer, uterine cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma, and the number of indications continues to grow. In addition to the treatment of advanced disease, the anti-tumor effect has been demonstrated across disease stages, from locally advanced disease to early-stage operative disease. The treatment of lung cancer is at the forefront of this trend and long-term durable responses and survival benefits in lung cancer have been exhibited that were unimaginable when cytotoxic anticancer agents were the only treatment options. However, treatment efficacy varies greatly from case to case, and no biomarkers have been developed to accurately predict efficacy.

	abstract = {Immunotherapy has revolutionised anti-cancer treatment in solid organ malignancies. Specifically, the discovery of CTLA-4 followed by PD-1 in the early 2000s led to the practice-changing clinical development of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). Patients with lung cancer, including both small cell (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), benefit from the most commonly used form of immunotherapy in immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), resulting in increased survival and quality of life. In NSCLC, the benefit of ICIs has now extended from advanced NSCLC to earlier stages of disease, resulting in durable benefits and the even the emergence of the word ‘cure’ in long term responders. However, not all patients respond to immunotherapy, and few patients achieve long-term survival. Patients may also develop immune-related toxicity, a small percentage of which is associated with significant mortality and morbidity. This review article highlights the various types of immunotherapeutic strategies, their modes of action, and the practice-changing clinical trials that have led to the widespread use of immunotherapy, with a focus on ICIs in NSCLC and the current challenges associated with advancing the field of immunotherapy. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) is a globally prevalent skin disease, with basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma accounting for 99% of NMSC cases. While surgical excision is the most common approach, numerous non-surgical therapies have rapidly advanced in recent years. In cases of low-risk NMSC, alongside surgical excision, priority should be given to physical therapy and photodynamic therapy. Physical therapy modalities, exemplified by electrodessication and curettage, emerge as safe and efficacious alternatives. In juxtaposition, photodynamic therapy, albeit relatively more costly, assumes preference for patients exhibiting heightened cosmetic concerns owing to the scarring risks inherent to physical therapy and surgical excision. Notably, the combination of curettage and photodynamic therapy has exhibited remarkable efficacy in the treatment of nodular basal cell carcinoma. Additionally, for elderly patients who may be intolerant to stimulation, modified photodynamic therapy offers an almost painless option. When surgery is unavoidable, photodynamic therapy can be a valuable adjunct, allowing for a more conservative surgical approach, either before or after the procedure. Radiotherapy holds a prominent role in comprehensive treatment strategies, especially for patients ineligible for surgical intervention or those with lesions precluding further surgical measures. In cases of NMSC exhibiting perineural invasion or lymphovascular involvement, adjunctive radiotherapy is advised; however, potential adverse effects necessitate careful consideration. For advanced NMSC cases where surgery and physical therapy fall short, immunotherapy provide viable solutions. Systemic therapy employing Hedgehog pathway inhibitors can be considered for patients with distant metastatic basal cell carcinoma, despite its low incidence, or individuals with locally advanced lesions who are not surgical candidates, or those encountering recurrences after resection and radiotherapy. However, close monitoring of disease progression and adverse reactions is crucial. In this evolving landscape of NMSC treatment, personalized and multidisciplinary approaches are key, ensuring optimal outcomes while prioritizing patient safety and satisfaction. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Immunotherapy is an effective treatment strategy for patients with advanced non‑small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Although clinical trials on immunotherapy have provided promising results, real‑world research in clinical practice is needed to assess the effectiveness and safety of immunotherapy. The present study aimed to characterize real‑world outcomes in patients with advanced NSCLC treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)‑based regimens. The medical records of patients with advanced NSCLC, who were treated with programmed cell death protein‑1 (PD‑1)/programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD‑L1) inhibitors, were reviewed for data collection. The primary objectives were to evaluate progression‑free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Therefore, multiple Cox regression models were used to investigate the predictive factors for survival outcomes. Furthermore, survival curves for PFS and OS were created using Kaplan‑Meier estimates and compared using the log‑rank test. The present study included a total of 133 patients with advanced NSCLC who received therapy with ICIs between January 1, 2019 and December 31, 2022. The final follow‑up date was August 24, 2023. The median PFS and OS times were 9.8 and 27.2 months, respectively. Univariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated that sex, clinical stage, PD‑L1 status, previous systemic therapy, and brain and liver metastases were associated with PFS, while Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) status, clinical stage, PD‑L1 status and brain metastasis were associated with OS. Furthermore, multi‑ variate Cox regression analysis demonstrated that a PD‑L1 tumor proportion score (TPS) of ≥50% was an indicator of favorable PFS and OS. An ECOG performance status score of ≥1 was also associated with poor OS but not with PFS. Furthermore, brain metastasis was an indicator for poor PFS and OS, while liver metastasis was only associated with a poor PFS. Finally, the results of the present study demonstrated that PD‑L1 status was an independent predictor for PFS and OS in patients with advanced NSCLC, especially adenocarcinoma, who were treated with ICIs plus chemotherapy. The results also suggested that patients with a PD‑L1 TPS of ≥50% could benefit when the aforementioned regimens were administrated as a first‑line or later‑line therapy. © 2024 Xu et al.},

	abstract = {Background: Immunotherapy (IO) has demonstrated promising results in treating extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC), and the management of ES-SCLC brain metastases (BMs) is now receiving significant clinical attention. The objective of this study was to evaluate the role of IO in the clinical management of BMs. Methods: Between January 2020 and December 2021, the study included the records of 250 patients who were diagnosed with ES-SCLC. Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival, intracranial progression-free survival, and the cumulative incidence of BMs were calculated using the Kaplan–Meier method and were compared using the log-rank test. In addition, the Cox regression model was used to analyze prognostic factors. Results: In the entire group, 85 patients had baseline BMs (IO plus chemotherapy [IO + ChT], n = 38; ChT alone, n = 47), and 165 patients (IO + ChT, n = 86; ChT alone, n = 79) did not have BMs at the time of initial diagnosis. The median follow-up was 22.4 months. The OS benefit with first-line antiprogrammed death ligand 1 therapy was maintained regardless of whether patients had BMs (with BMs, 17.97 vs. 13.14 months [p =.03]; without BMs, 18.46 vs. 15.05 months [p =.047]). However, in patients without BMs, IO did not delay the median time to developing brain progression (10.84 vs. 10.74 months; p =.84), and it did not significantly reduce the risk of developing intracranial metastases (the 2-year actuarial risk of developing BMs was 57.0% vs. 50.6%, respectively). Conclusions: Antiprogrammed death ligand 1 therapy improved OS regardless of the presence of BMs. However, IO did not delay the median time to brain progression or reduce the risk of intracranial metastasis in patients without baseline BMs. The findings of this study have important clinical implications for the future management of BMs from ES-SCLC. © 2023 American Cancer Society.},

	abstract = {Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is characterized by rapid growth and high metastatic capacity. It has strong epidemiologic and biologic links to tobacco carcinogens. Although the majority of SCLCs exhibit neuroendocrine features, an important subset of tumors lacks these properties. Genomic profiling of SCLC reveals genetic instability, almost universal inactivation of the tumor suppressor genes TP53 and RB1, and a high mutation burden. Because of early metastasis, only a small fraction of patients are amenable to curative-intent lung resection, and these individuals require adjuvant platinum-etoposide chemotherapy. Therefore, the vast majority of patients are currently being treated with chemoradiation with or without immunotherapy. In patients with disease confined to the chest, standard therapy includes thoracic radiotherapy and concurrent platinum-etoposide chemotherapy. Patients with metastatic (extensive-stage) disease are treated with a combination of platinum-etoposide chemotherapy plus immunotherapy with an anti-programmed death-ligand 1 monoclonal antibody. Although SCLC is initially very responsive to platinum-based chemotherapy, these responses are transient because of the development of drug resistance. In recent years, the authors have witnessed an accelerating pace of biologic insights into the disease, leading to the redefinition of the SCLC classification scheme. This emerging knowledge of SCLC molecular subtypes has the potential to define unique therapeutic vulnerabilities. Synthesizing these new discoveries with the current knowledge of SCLC biology and clinical management may lead to unprecedented advances in SCLC patient care. Here, the authors present an overview of multimodal clinical approaches in SCLC, with a special focus on illuminating how recent advancements in SCLC research could accelerate clinical development. © 2023 The Authors.

This is true not only for immunotherapies, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), but also for conventional chemotherapy, targeted anticancer agents, and radiation therapy. Thus, therapeutics that stress and kill cancer cells while provoking a tumor-targeting immune response, referred to as immunogenic cell death, are particularly useful in combination with ICIs. Modern oncology regimens are increasingly using such combinations, which are referred to as chemoimmunotherapy, as well as combinations of multiple ICIs. However, the latter are generally associated with severe side effects compared with single-agent ICIs. Of note, the success of these combinatorial strategies against locally advanced or metastatic cancers is now spurring successful attempts to move them past the postoperative (adjuvant) setting to the preoperative (neoadjuvant) setting, even for patients with operable cancers. Here, the authors critically discuss the importance of immunosurveillance in modern clinical cancer management. © 2023 The Authors.

	abstract = {Introduction: Treatment landscape for advanced/metastatic NSCLC (aNSCLC) has evolved considerably over the past few decades with the advent of targeted therapies for epidermal growth factor receptor-mutated (EGFRm+) aNSCLC treatment. This study described real-world patient and disease characteristics, treatment and practice patterns, and clinical, economic, and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in patients with EGFRm+ aNSCLC. Methods: Data were derived from the Adelphi NSCLC Disease Specific Programme™ (DSP™), a point-in-time survey conducted between July and December 2020. The survey included oncologists and pulmonologists, and their consulting patients (with physician-confirmed EGFRm+ aNSCLC) from nine countries: the US, Brazil, the UK, Italy, France, Spain, Germany, Japan, and Taiwan. All analyses were descriptive. Results: Overall, 542 physicians reported data for 2857 patients (mean age 65.6 years), and most patients were female (56.0%), white (61.0%), and had stage IV disease at initial diagnosis (76.0%), and adenocarcinoma histology (89.0%). Most patients received EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) therapy in first- (91.0%), second- (74.0%), and third-line (67.0%). The most common tumor samples and methods for EGFR detection were EGFR-specific mutation detection tests (44.0%) and core needle biopsy (56.0%). Median time to next treatment was 14.0 (IQR 8.0–22.0) months and disease progression was the main physician-reported reason for early discontinuation. The most common physician-reported disease symptoms were cough (51.0%), fatigue (37.0%), and dyspnea (33.0%). In patients assessed for PROs, mean EQ-5D-5L index and FACT-L health utility scores were 0.71 and 83.5, respectively. On average, patients lost 10.6 h of work/week for approximately 29.2 weeks due to EGFRm+ aNSCLC. Conclusion: This real-world multinational data set showed that most patients with EGFRm+ aNSCLC were treated per the country relevant clinical guidelines, with progression as the main reason for early treatment discontinuation. For the included countries, these findings may offer a useful benchmark for decision makers to determine future allocation of healthcare resources for patients with EGFRm+ aNSCLC. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {(1) Background: At present, the efficacy and safety of thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) after chemo-immunotherapy (CT-IT) in patients with extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) still remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of TRT after CT-IT in patients with ES-SCLC. (2) Methods: From January 2020 to October 2021, patients with ES-SCLC treated with first-line anti-PD-L1 antibody plus platinum-etoposide chemotherapy were enrolled retrospectively. The survival data and adverse events data of patients treated with or without TRT after CT-IT were collected for analysis. (3) Results: A total of 118 patients with ES-SCLC treated with first-line CT-IT were retrospectively enrolled, with 45 patients with TRT and 73 patients without TRT after CT-IT. The median PFS and OS in the CT-IT + TRT group and CT-IT only group were 8.0 months versus 5.9 months (HR = 0.64, p = 0.025) and 22.7 months versus 14.7 months (HR = 0.52, p = 0.015), respectively. The median PFS and OS in all 118 patients treated with first-line CT-IT were 7.2 and 19.8 months with an ORR of 72.0%. In multivariate analyses, liver metastasis and response to CT-IT were shown to be independent prognostic factors of PFS (p < 0.05), while liver metastasis and bone metastasis were independent predictive factors of OS (p < 0.05). Although TRT was significantly associated with better PFS and OS in univariate analysis, the association of TRT and OS failed to reach statistical significance (HR = 0.564, p = 0.052) in multivariate analysis. There was no significant difference in adverse events (AEs) between two treatment groups (p = 0.58). (4) Conclusions: ES-SCLC patients treated with TRT after first-line CT-IT had prolonged PFS and OS with an acceptable safety profile. Further prospective randomized studies are necessary to explore the efficacy and safety of this treatment modality for ES-SCLC in future. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Lung cancer (LC), particularly nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), is one of the most prevalent types of neoplasia worldwide, regardless of gender, with the highest mortality rates in oncology. Over the years, treatment for NSCLC has evolved from conventional surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy to more tailored and minimally invasive approaches. The use of personalised therapies has increased the expected efficacy of treatment while simultaneously reducing the frequency of severe adverse effects (AEs). In this review, we discuss established modern approaches, including immunotherapy and targeted therapy, as well as experimental molecular methods like clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) and nanoparticles. These emerging methods offer promising outcomes and shorten the recovery time for various patients. Recent advances in the diagnostic field, including imaging and genetic profiling, have enabled the implementation of these methods. The versatility of these modern therapies allows for multiple treatment options, such as single-agent use, combination with existing conventional treatments, or incorporation into new regimens. As a result, patients can survive even in the advanced stages of NSCLC, leading to increased survival indicators such as overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Locally advanced non-small lung cancer encompasses a diverse range of tumors. In the last few years, the treatment of stage III unresectable non-small lung cancer has evolved significantly. The PACIFIC trial opened a new therapeutic era in the treatment of locally advanced NSCLC, establishing durvalumab consolidation therapy as the new standard of care worldwide. A careful evaluation of this type of lung cancer and a discussion of the management of these patients within a multidisciplinary team represents a crucial step in defining the best treatment strategy for each patient. For unresectable stage III NSCLC, definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) was historically recommended as a treatment with a 5-year survival rate ranging from 20% to 30%. The PACIFIC study conducted in 2017 compared the use of chemoradiotherapy and maintenance therapy with the anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody durvalumab to a placebo in patients with locally advanced NSCLC who had not experienced disease progression. The study was prospective, randomized, and phase III. The administration of this medication in patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has demonstrated a notable improvement in overall survival. Multiple clinical trials are currently exploring various immune checkpoint inhibition regimens to enhance the treatment efficacy in patients with stage III cancer. Our goal is to offer an up-to-date summary of the planned clinical trials for treatment options, focusing on the significant obstacles and prospects in the post-PACIFIC era.

	abstract = {Background: In view of the limited data on radiotherapy (RT) combined with immunotherapy in patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC), this study aimed to identify the immune activation effect on different sites and the survival outcomes of radioimmunotherapy at different treatment stages. Methods: Forty-five patients diagnosed with ES-SCLC were included in this retrospective analysis. We collected the overall survival (OS) of the patients, recorded the blood cell counts before, during, and after RT, and derived blood index ratios such as the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and systemic immune-inflammation index (SII). The datasets were analyzed using the Spearman rank correlation test, Kruskal–Wallis rank sum test and logistic regression. Results: Among the selected blood indices, the delta-NLR/PLR/Sll correlated with different irradiated organs, and the mean ranks of these three indices were the lowest in the brain-irradiated group during immunotherapy. Additionally, adjunct first-line immunotherapy with RT demonstrated a significant improvement compared to second- or third-line therapy and subsequent therapies. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that compared to other organs, the strongest immune activation effect occurs with brain RT, and ES-SCLC patients who received radioimmunotherapy (RIT) earlier achieved higher OS rates. © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

Methods: Review of long-term survival and quality-of-life after curative treatment in eNSCLC patients in observational studies. Results: Disease-free proportion decreased in stage III vs stage I patients. Recurrence-free proportion decreased with age and disease stage. Advanced stage and vascular invasion increased risk of late recurrence. Conditional 5-year relative survival rates did not exceed 87%, indicating higher mortality in eNSCLC survivors. Lower conditional survival rates and relative survival rates were associated with older age and advanced disease. Survivors of eNSCLC had poorer physical quality-of-life. Conclusion: Despite curative-intent therapy, survivors of eNSCLC still face significant risks of recurrence, excess mortality, and diminished quality-of-life.Plain language summary Early-stage NSCLC (eNSCLC) encompassing stage I and II, and resectable stage III disease is initially managed with curative-intent surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy to reduce the risk of recurrence. However, understanding the true curative potential and long-term outcomes is crucial for optimal clinical management. A literature review was conducted to identify observational studies describing long-term survival and quality-of-life outcomes following curative intent therapy in patients with eNSCLC. The proportion of patients who remained disease-free over time (without recurrence or death) statistically significantly decreased in patients with stage III disease compared with stage I disease. Similarly, the proportion of patients who remained recurrence-free over time decreased with increasing age and disease stage. A considerable risk of late recurrence (recurrence five or more years following resection) remained, increasing with advanced stage and tumor characteristics such as vascular invasion. Conditional 5-year relative survival rates did not exceed 87% in any study, indicating higher rates of all-cause mortality in long-term survivors of eNSCLC compared with members of the general population of the same age. Lower conditional 5-year relative survival rates, and 5 and 10-year relative survival rates were associated with older age and higher pathologic stage. Compared with the general population, survivors of eNSCLC reported significantly poorer physical quality-of-life, suggesting that symptoms persist after treatment. Overall, real-world evidence suggests that after standard curative-intent therapy, survivors of eNSCLC may not be considered fully cured, indicating a need for more effective adjuvant treatment in addition to the current standard of care.  © 2023 Nick Jovanoski, Kathleen Bowes, Audrey Brown, Rossella Belleli, Danilo Di Maio, Shkun Chadda, Seye Abogunrin.},

Although patients with resectable NSCLC are often treated with surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy or targeted therapies +/− radiotherapy, they still have a high risk of recurrence and death. In recent years, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) (anti-PD-1/PD-L1 and anti-CTLA-4) have provided a new and effective therapeutic strategy for the treatment of advanced NSCLC. Therefore, it is possible that ICIs for early-stage NSCLC may follow the pattern established in metastatic disease. Currently, there are several ongoing trials to determine the efficacy in the neoadjuvant setting for patients with local or regional disease. To date, only nivolumab in combination with chemotherapy has been approved by the U.S. FDA in the preoperative setting, but data continue to evolve rapidly, and treatment guidelines need to be determined.

SCLC has a high incidence of brain metastasis (BM) and brain radiotherapy (BRT) is the main local treatment method, but there is limited data on the BRT-immunotherapy scheme. The aim of the retrospective study is to investigate the clinical efficacy and safety of the first-line anti-PD-L1 blockades combined with BRT in ES-SCLC with BM. Methods: Patients with newly diagnosed ES-SCLC with baseline BMs at Shandong Cancer Hospital and Research Institute between 2017 and 2021 were selected. Patients were divided into the anti-PD-L1+BRT group and BRT group. We also assessed the leukoencephalopathy in both groups. Results: A total of 46 patients were selected. Fifteen were divided into anti-PD-L1+BRT group and 31 to BRT group. The median overall survival (OS) was not reached (NR) vs 15.9 m (P = 0.172). Progression-free survival (PFS) was numerically prolonged with anti-PD-L1 blockades, but the significance was not reached (median: 9.4 m vs 7.4 m, P = 0.362). The median intracranial PFS was not improved, neither (median: 8.2 m vs 8.9 m, P = 0.620). Objective response rate (ORR) in the two groups was 73.33% vs 77.42% (P = 0.949) and disease control rate (DCR) was both 100%. Intracranial ORR and DCR were 53.33% vs 70.97% (P = 0.239) and 73.33% vs 80.65% (P = 0.855), respectively. There was no significant difference in leukoencephalopathy incidence between the two groups. Conclusion: The combination of first-line anti-PD-L1 blockades with BRT did not confer a significant survival benefit in ES-SCLC with BM, without enhancing cranial neurotoxicity. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {The phenomenon of histological transformation has been widely reported in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR mutations following the failure of EGFR-TKI treatment. Recent evidence suggests that similar histological changes can also occur in advanced NSCLC without driver gene mutations after developing resistance to immunotherapy. In this review, it was found that 66.7% of cases with immunotherapy-induced histological transformation were classified as lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC), while histological conversion into lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) without EGFR or ALK gene mutations has rarely been reported. There have been sporadic reports on the occurrence of mutual transformation between LUAD and LSCC. The histological conversion from NSCLC into small cell lung cancer (SCLC) appears to be significantly underestimated, likely due to the infrequency of re-biopsy following the development of immunotherapy resistance. Several studies have reported a close association between the transformation and mutations at TP53 and the RB1 splice site, as well as the loss of an FBXW7 mutation. However, the exact mechanisms underlying this conversion remain unclear. Currently, there is a lack of guidelines for the management of transformed SCLC from NSCLC following immunotherapy, with chemotherapy being the most commonly employed treatment approach.

	abstract = {Background: Programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors plus chemotherapy have made substantial progress in extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC), but the survival benefit is still limited. This study aimed to evaluate the preliminary efficacy and safety of camrelizumab plus platinum-irinotecan (IP/IC) followed by maintenance camrelizumab plus apatinib in patients with untreated ES-SCLC. Methods: In this non-randomized clinical trial (NCT04453930), eligible patients with untreated ES-SCLC received 4-6 cycles of camrelizumab plus IP/IC, followed by maintenance with camrelizumab plus apatinib until disease progression or unmanageable toxicity. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Patients who received PD-L1 inhibitors (atezolizumab or durvalumab) plus platinum-etoposide (EP/EC) were selected as the historical control. Results: Nineteen patients received IP/IC plus camrelizumab and 34 patients received EP/EC plus PD-L1 inhibitor. At a median follow-up time of 12.1 months, the median PFS was 10.25 months (95% CI: 9.40-NA) in the IP/IC plus camrelizumab group and 7.10 months (95% CI 5.79-8.40) in the EP/EC plus PD-L1 inhibitor group, respectively (HR=0.58, 95% CI 0.42-0.81). The objective response rate of IP/IC plus camrelizumab and EP/EC plus PD-L1 inhibitor was 89.6% and 82.4%, respectively. The most common treatment-related adverse events in the IP/IC plus camrelizumab group was neutropenia, followed by reactive cutaneous capillary endothelial proliferation (RCCEP) and diarrhea. The occurrence of immune-related adverse event was found to be associated with a prolonged PFS (HR=4.64, 95% CI 1.92-11.18). Conclusions: IP/IC plus camrelizumab followed by maintenance camrelizumab plus apatinib showed preliminary efficacy and acceptable safety profile in patients with untreated ES-SCLC.

	abstract = {Background: Although immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) provide unprecedented survival improvement for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), disease progression inevitably occurs. After ICIs failure, limited data exist on whether ICI-based treatment beyond progression (TBP) may be beneficial to advanced NSCLC. This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of this treatment approach in advanced NSCLC and identify potential beneficial factors. Methods: Patients with stage IV NSCLC who received ICI-based treatment after the failure of prior PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor treatments (monotherapy or combination therapy) between January 2016 and July 2020 were enrolled. Their clinical characteristics and treatment procedures were collected, and the follow-up would be performed. Results: A total of 204 patients were included. All patients had disease progression after prior immunotherapy, with 49.5% (101/204) of patients presenting with new metastasis lesions and the rest 50.5% (103/204) of patients' progression on originate lesions. Within the entire cohort, the median progression-free survival (PFS) and median overall survival (OS) of ICI-based TBP with prior immunotherapy were 5.0 months (95% CI: 4.5-5.5 months) and 15.7 months (95% CI: 14.7-16.8 months), respectively. The objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) were 9.3% and 74.0%, respectively. According to the multivariate analysis, ICI-based combination therapy [PFS: hazard ratio (HR), 0.48, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.28-0.84, P=0.011] (OS: HR, 0.44, 95% CI: 0.23-0.85, P=0.014), not having targetable gene alterations (PFS: HR, 0.56, 95% CI: 0.40-0.79, P=0.001) (OS: HR, 0.57, 95% CI: 0.37-0.87, P=0.009), and good response to prior immunotherapy (PFS: HR, 0.36, 95% CI: 0.24-0.53, P<0.0001) (OS: HR, 0.31, 95% CI: 0.19-0.52, P<0.0001) were independently associated with improved PFS and OS. Moreover, disease progression due to appearances of new metastasis (OS: HR, 0.56, 95% CI: 0.37-0.84, P=0.005) was only associated with better OS. Conclusions: While the ORR in patients with advanced NSCLC receiving ICI-based TBP with prior immunotherapy was limited, the DCR was relatively high in our study which is encouraging. ICI-based treatment strategy may be a reasonable option for patients who progressed from prior immunotherapy. Further prospective studies on larger sample size are warranted. © 2022 AME Publishing Company. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a severe disease and still has high mortality rate after conventional treatment (e.g., surgical resection, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and targeted therapy). In NSCLC patients, cancer cells can induce immunosuppression, growth and metastasis by modulating cell adhesion molecules of both cancer cells and immune cells. Therefore, immunotherapy is increasingly concerned due to its promising anti-tumor effect and broader indication, which targets cell adhesion molecules to reverse the process. Among these therapies, immune checkpoint inhibitors (mainly anti-PD-(L)1 and anti-CTLA-4) are most successful and have been adapted as first or second line therapy in advanced NSCLC. However, drug resistance and immune-related adverse reactions restrict its further application. Further understanding of mechanism, adequate biomarkers and novel therapies are necessary to improve therapeutic effect and alleviate adverse effect. Copyright © 2023 Yang, Miao, Yu, Wei and Jiao.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Chemoradiotherapy (CRT) followed by consolidation immune checkpoint inhibitors significantly improves survival in unresectable locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer. However, the optimal sequence for CRT and immune checkpoint inhibitors has not yet been established. We investigated the dynamics of peripheral blood immune cells during CRT to determine the best sequence for treatment. Methods and Materials: Peripheral blood samples were prospectively collected pretreatment, weekly during CRT for 6 weeks, and 1 month posttreatment in 24 patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer who received definitive CRT. Immune cell analysis was performed by flow cytometry. Ex vivo PD-1 blockade assays were performed by IFN-γ intracellular cytokine staining. Results: Lymphopenia was prominently observed during CRT and mostly recovered 1 month post-CRT. Robust proliferation of CD8+ T cells was induced, peaking in the last week during CRT and decreasing post-CRT. The robust proliferation of CD8+ T cells led to an increase in the frequency of CD28–CD57+ replicative senescent and terminally differentiated cells post-CRT. Tumor-reactive CD8+ T cells increased during CRT and peaked in the last week. One month post-CRT, the frequency of tumor-reactive CD8+ T cells decreased and TOXhiTCF1lo terminally exhausted CD8+ T cells significantly increased. Anti-PD-1-induced functional restoration of PD-1+CD8+ T cells was maximized in the last week of CRT and significantly decreased post-CRT. Conclusions: The findings suggest that earlier administration of PD-1 blockade may be associated with superior efficacy compared with delayed administration after completion of CRT. These findings provide an immunologic rationale for optimal timing of combining immune checkpoint inhibitors with CRT in clinical trials. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive neuroendocrine carcinoma with early metastatic potential. The standard-of-care treatment has not changed in years. Recent studies report improved progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) with combined ICI and chemotherapy in ES-SCLC. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the magnitude of survival benefits. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane between 1 January 2010 and 15 July 2022 and conference proceedings from 2018 to 2022, for randomised controlled trials, evaluating chemo-ICI compared with platinum-doublet chemotherapy in untreated ES-SCLC. Outcomes assessed were PFS, OS, objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DoR), toxicity, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The search identified 8061 studies, with 8 (56 publications) included in the final analysis. PFS and OS were significantly improved for patients randomised to chemo-ICI (PFS hazard ratio (HR) 0.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70–0.80) and (OS HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.73–0.85). Subgroup analysis demonstrated a differential effect between PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 inhibitors. There was no difference in ORR and DoR. All-grade adverse events (RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.00–1.12) were similar. The addition of ICI to chemotherapy in untreated ES-SCLC results in a 22% risk reduction in death, and a 25% risk reduction in disease progression with a minimal increase in toxicity. These improvements are modest but represent progress beyond the standard of care. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Objective The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of durvalumab compared with Best supportive care (BSC) after chemoradiotherapy in patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer from healthcare system perspective in China. Methods A dynamic state transition model was adopted to simulate life time, direct medical costs and QALYs. In the base case scenario, for patients with unresectable, stage Ⅲ non-small cell lung cancer whose disease has not progressed after platinum-based chemoradiation therapy, the treatment group would use durvalumab whereas the control group would use BSC. Clinical data and health utility were derived from the patient-level data of Asian ethnicity in the PACIFIC trial. Cost of drug acquisition, follow-up, medical service, inspection, terminal care and adverse event treatment were considered in this model. The cost of durvalumab was calculated based on retail prices and Patient Assistance Program. Results In the base case, the durvalumab group yielded an additional 2.60 LYs and 2.37QALYs (discounted), causing an additional cost of 0.459 million RMB and 0.109 million RMB without and with PAP, so the ICER was 193,898 RMB/QALY and 46,093.12 RMB/QALY respectively. Conclusions This study demonstrated that durvalumab can improve the survival of patients with unresectable, stage Ⅲ non-small cell lung cancer whose disease has not progressed after platinum-based chemoradiation therapy and would be a cost-effective option compared with BSC at a willingness to pay (WTP) threshold of 212676 RMB (three times GDP per capita of China in 2019). © 2022 Jiang et al.

	abstract = {Recently, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) therapy has become a promising therapeutic strategy with encouraging therapeutic outcomes due to their durable anti-tumor effects. Though, tumor inherent or acquired resistance to ICIs accompanied with treatment-related toxicities hamper their clinical utility. Overall, about 60–70% of patients (e.g., melanoma and lung cancer) who received ICIs show no objective response to intervention. The resistance to ICIs mainly caused by alterations in the tumor microenvironment (TME), which in turn, supports angiogenesis and also blocks immune cell antitumor activities, facilitating tumor cells' evasion from host immunosurveillance. Thereby, it has been supposed and also validated that combination therapy with ICIs and other therapeutic means, ranging from chemoradiotherapy to targeted therapies as well as cancer vaccines, can capably compromise tumor resistance to immune checkpoint blocked therapy. Herein, we have focused on the therapeutic benefits of ICIs as a groundbreaking approach in the context of tumor immunotherapy and also deliver an overview concerning the therapeutic influences of the addition of ICIs to other modalities to circumvent tumor resistance to ICIs. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background and aim: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) continues to claim millions of lives worldwide. Although its poor prognosis is largely attributed to the lack of adequate and precise detection technologies, cancer cells’ suppression of the immune system adds on to the difficulty of identifying abnormal NSCLC tumors in their early stages. Therefore, cancer immunotherapy, which activates the immune system and helps it fight tumors, has recently become the most sought-after technique, especially in the advanced stages of NSCLC, where surgery or chemotherapy may or may not bring about the desired survival benefits in patients. Methods: This review focuses on the various immunotherapeutic interventions and their efficacy in advanced NSCLC clinical trials. Monoclonal antibodies like anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agents and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies, cancer vaccines, oncolytic viruses and adoptive T cell therapy have been discussed in brief. Furthermore, the effects of gender, age, and race on the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors and suggest plausible future approaches in the realm of immuno-oncology. Results: Immunotherapy is used alone or in combination either with other immunological agents or with chemotherapy. However, the efficacy of these strategies depends extensively on various demographic variables, as some patients respond perfectly well to immunotherapy, while others do not benefit at all or experience disease progression. By targeting a “hallmark” of cancer (immune evasion), immunotherapy has transformed NSCLC management, though several barriers prevent its complete effectiveness. Conclusions: All these immunological strategies should be interpreted in the current setting of synergistic treatment, in which these agents can be combined with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and, or surgery following patient and tumor characteristics to proportionate the best-individualized treatment and achieve superior results. To better pursue this goal, further investigations on cost-effectiveness and sex-gender, race, and age differences in immunotherapy are needed. © 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {Over the past decade, immunotherapy has become an increasingly fundamental modality in the treatment of cancer. The positive impact of immune checkpoint inhibition, especially anti-programmed death (PD)-1/PD-ligand (L)1 blockade, in patients with different cancers has focused attention on the potential for other immunotherapeutic approaches. These include inhibitors of additional immune checkpoints, adoptive cell transfer (ACT), and therapeutic vaccines. Patients with advanced cancers who previously had limited treatment options available may now benefit from immunotherapies that can offer durable responses and improved survival outcomes. However, despite this, a significant proportion of patients fail to respond to immunotherapy, especially those with less immunoresponsive cancer types, and there remains a need for new treatment strategies. The virtual Immunotherapy Bridge (December 1st–2nd, 2021), organized by the Fondazione Melanoma Onlus, Naples, Italy in collaboration with the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer addressed several areas of current research in immunotherapy, including lessons learned from cell therapies, drivers of immune response, and trends in immunotherapy across different cancers, and these are summarised here. © 2022, The Author(s).},

Furthermore, nanotechnology providing solutions to these restrictions and boosting cancer therapy. Nanoparticles are widely used nanomedicine platform in cancer immunotherapy due to their excellent physicochemical properties that include size, shape, and surface features, resulting into desirable biological interactions and have been categorized into several types. Nanoparticles can also be potentially be up taken by antigen-presenting cells that promote the cytosolic delivery of encapsulated antigens and adjuvants. Furthermore, nanoparticles can be fine-tuned and functionalized with specific moieties to promote their efficacy in targeting and delivering cargo materials to specific locations. In this review, we summarized and discussed nanoparticles and potential features to be used as carriers in cancer immunotherapy, the current status of different types of nanoparticles, and the importance of their functionalization. Furthermore, we have also discussed nanoparticles-based nanomedicine in targeted delivery of encapsulated cancer immunotherapeutic and their involvement in the modulation of the tumor microenvironment, promoting cancer immunotherapy. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

However, 80% to 90% of lung cancers are non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and the remaining 10% to 20% are small cell lung cancer. Adenocarcinoma is the most common histologic subtype of lung cancer worldwide. More frequently, lung cancer diagnosis is made in advanced stages. Stage III NSCLC refers to locoregionally advanced disease without metastases and represents about 30% NSCLC cases. Despite the absence of metastases at diagnosis, the outcome is generally poor. Stage III comprises a heterogeneous group and optimal management requires the input of a multidisciplinary team. All modalities of oncologic treatment are involved: surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and more recently, immunotherapy and targeted therapy. We will discuss the different therapeutic options in stage III NSCLC, both in operable and inoperable scenarios, and the role of immunotherapy and targeted therapy. © The Author(s) 2023.},

	abstract = {Tumour-associated macrophages are an essential component of the tumour microenvironment and have a role in the orchestration of angiogenesis, extracellular matrix remodelling, cancer cell proliferation, metastasis and immunosuppression, as well as in resistance to chemotherapeutic agents and checkpoint blockade immunotherapy. Conversely, when appropriately activated, macrophages can mediate phagocytosis of cancer cells and cytotoxic tumour killing, and engage in effective bidirectional interactions with components of the innate and adaptive immune system. Therefore, they have emerged as therapeutic targets in cancer therapy. Macrophage-targeting strategies include inhibitors of cytokines and chemokines involved in the recruitment and polarization of tumour-promoting myeloid cells as well as activators of their antitumorigenic and immunostimulating functions. Early clinical trials suggest that targeting negative regulators (checkpoints) of myeloid cell function indeed has antitumor potential. Finally, given the continuous recruitment of myelomonocytic cells into tumour tissues, macrophages are candidates for cell therapy with the development of chimeric antigen receptor effector cells. Macrophage-centred therapeutic strategies have the potential to complement, and synergize with, currently available tools in the oncology armamentarium. © 2022, Springer Nature Limited.},

	abstract = {Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) as biological macromolecules have been remarked the large and growing pipline of the pharmaceutical market and also the most promising tool in modern medicine for cancer therapy. These therapeutic entities, which consist of whole mAbs, armed mAbs (i.e., antibody-toxin conjugates, antibody-drug conjugates, and antibody-radionuclide conjugates), and antibody fragments, mostly target tumor cells. However, due to intrinsic heterogeneity of cancer diseases, tumor cells targeting mAb have been encountered with difficulties in their unpredictable efficacy as well as variability in remission and durable clinical benefits among cancer patients. To address these pitfalls, the area has undergone two major evolutions with the intent of minimizing anti-drug responses and addressing limitations experienced with tumor cell-targeted therapies. As a novel hallmark of cancer, the tumor microenvironment (TME) is becoming the great importance of attention to develop innovative strategies based on therapeutic mAbs. Here, we underscore innovative strategies targeting TME by mAbs which destroy tumor cells indirectly through targeting vasculature system (e.g., anti-angiogenesis), immune system modulation (i.e., stimulation, suppression, and depletion), the targeting and blocking of stroma-based growth signals (e.g., cancer-associated fibroblasts), and targeting cancer stem cells, as well as, their effector mechanisms, clinical uses, and relevant mechanisms of resistance. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

Especially the use of immunotherapy, particularly inhibitors of PD-1 (programmed cell death protein 1), PDL-1 (programmed cell death protein ligand 1), and CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4). Since 2015, these drugs have transformed the treatment of advanced NSCLC lacking driver mutations, evolving from second-line therapy to first-line, with excellent results. The arrival of new checkpoint inhibitors such as cemiplimab and the use of checkpoint inhibitors earlier in the therapy of advanced and metastatic cancers has been making the future prospects for treating NSCLC lacking driver mutations more favorable and optimistic. In addition, for those patients who have low PDL-1 positivity tumors, the combination of cytotoxic chemotherapy, VEGF inhibitor, and immunotherapy have shown an important improvement in global survival and progression free survival regardless the PDL-1 status. We also explored the effectiveness of adding radiotherapy to immunotherapy and the most current results about this combination. One concern that cannot be overlooked is the safety profile of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) and the most common toxicities are described throughout this paper as well as tumor resistance to ICI. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Introduction: Little is known about the effectiveness of immunotherapy alone or with chemotherapy for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression <50 %. We examined the outcomes of PD-L1 therapy vs. PD-L1 therapy in combination with chemotherapy as first-line treatment among NSCLC patients with PD-L1 score <50 %. Methods: We used administrative claims and prior authorization data of a national insurer from November 2015 to July 2021. We selected patients with Stage IIIb/IV NSCLC and PD-L1 expression <50 %. Each patient was required to have ≥1 claim of a PD-L1 or PD-1 inhibitor. Treatment groups were propensity-score matched 1:1 on baseline characteristics. We measured PD-L1 therapy duration, incident immune-related adverse events (irAEs), healthcare utilization, costs, and overall survival (OS). Results: In the matched sample totaling 176 patients, mean duration of PD-L1 therapy was similar (4.1 [SD 3.3] months combination vs. 4.0 [SD 4.9] months monotherapy, p = 0.800). IrAEs were similar, both for FDA-recognized irAEs (48.9 % combination, 48.9 % monotherapy, p = 0.710) and other types (34.1 % combination, 39.8 % monotherapy, p = 0.473). The combination group had more all-cause inpatient stays, ER visits, and outpatient visits (all p < 0.001). Total adjusted all-cause medical cost was $112,833 (95 % CI $5,548-$251,973) higher for combination therapy. We saw no difference in OS (adjusted hazard ratio 1.09 [95 % CI 0.72–1.65]). Conclusion: This study found no difference in adverse drug effects or survival between PD-L1 monotherapy compared to combination therapy for patients with Stage IIIb/IV NSCLC and PD-L1 expression <50 %, though the combination therapy cohort had higher healthcare utilization and costs. Use of immunotherapy alone or combined with chemotherapy for patients with non-small cell lung cancer and programmed death ligand 1 expression <50 % is understudied. Our observational study using claims and authorization data from a matched sample of 176 patients found no difference in survival or the rate of adverse drug effects between groups, although the chemo-immunotherapy cohort generated higher overall healthcare costs. © 2023},

In the era of immunotherapy, the role of thoracic radiotherapy for ES-SCLC remains unclear. Methods We retrospectively included ES-SCLC patients treated with first-line EP-based chemotherapy plus atezolizumab or durvalumab at Taichung Veterans General Hospital to evaluate the prognostic role and safety of thoracic radiotherapy. Results A total of 22 patients were included. The median age was 64 years and most of them were male and smokers. Sixteen patients (72.7%) received durvalumab, while the other 6 patients (27.3%) underwent atezolizumab treatment. Among these patients, 11 (50.0%) had a history of thoracic radiotherapy. There was no significant difference in baseline characteristics between patients with and without thoracic radiotherapy. In the overall population, the objective response rate to immunotherapy plus chemotherapy was 73.7%. The progression-free survival and overall survival were 6.0 months (95% CI: 4.0-7.9) and 13.8 months (95% CI: 8.0-19.6), respectively. The overall survival was significantly longer in patients with thoracic radiotherapy (not-reached [NR] [95% CI NR-NR] vs. 9.6 months [95% CI 2.5-16.6]), respectively (P value by log-rank test <0.001). Both multivariate analysis and subgroup analysis specifically comparing patients with consolidative thoracic radiotherapy and patients with clinical benefits to systemic therapy who did not undergo thoracic radiotherapy indicated that thoracic radiotherapy improved survival. Conclusion The real-world efficacy of EP-based chemotherapy plus atezolizumab or durvalumab was comparable with that of clinical trials.

	abstract = {Anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)-directed immunotherapy has revolutionized the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, predictive biomarkers are still lacking, particularly in identifying PD-L1low/negative patients who will benefit from immunotherapy. It was previously reported that farnesoid X receptor (FXR) downregulated PD-L1 expression in NSCLC, and that FXRhighPD-L1low mouse Lewis lung carcinoma tumors showed an increased susceptibility to PD-1 blockade compared with mock tumors. At present, whether the FXRhighPD-L1low phenotype predicts clinical response to immunotherapy in patients with NSCLC remains unclear. Herein, a retrospective study was conducted to examine the expression levels of FXR, PD-L1 and CD8+ T cells by immunohistochemistry in a cohort of 149 patients with NSCLC receiving anti-PD-1-based chemo-immunotherapy. The results revealed that high FXR and PD-L1 expression levels were associated with higher objective response rates (ORR) in all patients. High PD-L1 expression also indicated superior progression-free survival (PFS). Interestingly, an inverse correlation was identified between FXR and PD-L1 expression in specimens with NSCLC. Subgroup analysis revealed that high FXR expression was associated with a higher ORR, as well as longer PFS and overall survival (OS) in PD-L1low patients. Cox multivariate analysis revealed that high FXR expression was an independent predictor for PFS and OS in PD-L1low patients. Tumor microenvironment evaluation revealed a statistically significant decrease of infiltrating CD8+ T cells in FXRhigh specimens with NSCLC. Overall, the present study proposed an FXRhighPD-L1low signature as a candidate predictor of response to anti-PD-1-based chemo-immunotherapy in PD-L1low/negative patients with NSCLC, providing evidence that could be used to broaden the patients benefitting from immunotherapy. © 2022 Spandidos Publications.

	abstract = {Brain metastasis is a rare refractory event in patients with urothelial carcinoma. Platinum-based chemotherapy is the recommended first-line standard therapy for all metastasis urothelial carcinoma patients eligible for cisplatin or carboplatin. Patients ineligible for platinum may receive immunotherapy. No clear evidence exists that UC with brain metastasis is sensitive to immunotherapy, and the optimal treatment for patients with BM is uncertain. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of combined immunotherapy and antivascular therapy in an elderly patient with urothelial carcinoma with brain metastasis, and summarize the currently available evidence. First, she underwent a left nephrectomy and left ureterectomy and recovered well postoperatively. The postoperative pathologic findings were consistent with urothelial carcinoma. Approximately 2 years later, the patient developed impaired limb movement on the right side and underwent MRI, which revealed lesions in the left frontal lobe and suggested brain metastasis. The brain metastasis responded to local radiotherapy but progressed again in a short time. Then, the patient was administered toripalimab at 240 mg combined with bevacizumab at 300 mg every 3 weeks. After 1cycle of treatment, the patient achieved a quick response, and symptoms improved significantly. Repeat evaluation imaging demonstrated that the lesions in the brain and lung were significantly smaller and evaluation showed partial response. The treatment was well tolerated and the patient remained in partial response until the last follow-up by July 2022, 6 months after the initiation of treatment. This case suggests that immune checkpoint blockade combined with antivascular therapy might be a new possibility for patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma, including brain metastases. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

	abstract = {Introduction: The phase II DETERRED trial assessed the safety and efficacy of consolidation and concurrent immunotherapy with chemoradiation in unresectable locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer. We present updated efficacy analysis of this trial. Methods: The trial was conducted in 2 parts with patients in part 1 (n = 10) receiving chemoradiation with consolidation atezolizumab, while patients in part 2 (n = 30) received concurrent and consolidation atezolizumab. Progression-free survival (PFS), time to second progression (PFS2), and overall survival (OS) were assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Subset analyses were performed by programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) status and targetable driver oncogene mutation status. Results: At a median follow-up of 39.2 months, the median PFS for part 1 was 18.9 months and 15.1 months for part 2. Median OS for part 1 was 26.5 months and was not reached for part 2. For the cohort, 3-year OS was 53.8%, while 4-year OS was 47.4%. Patients with targetable driver oncogene mutations had a median PFS of 9.4 months and OS of not reached compared to 16.6 months (HR: 3.49, p = 0.02) and 26.9 months (HR: 0.40, p = 0.12) respectively compared to those without targetable driver oncogene mutations. Patients with PD-L1 < 1% had median PFS of 11.0 months and OS of 26.5 months compared to 27.4 months (HR: 2.01, p = 0.10) and not reached (HR: 1.49, p = 0.41) respectively for those with PD-L1 ≥ 1%. Conclusions: In the DETERRED trial, chemoradiation with concurrent and/or consolidative atezolizumab led to comparable efficacy as consolidative durvalumab in the PACIFIC trial. The presence of targetable driver oncogene mutations led to worse PFS, while PD-L1 < 1% trended to worse PFS. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is comprised of a heterogeneous cohort of patient presentations that are broadly considered as “locally advanced disease,” but stage IIIA/N2 further selects a subset of this category with a potentially improved prognosis. These individuals may have ipsilateral mediastinal and/or subcarinal lymph node involvement, varying tumor size (up to 7 cm), and possible invasion of surrounding mediastinal structures. Multimodality treatment is universally accepted as the standard-of-care for their management, and historically, definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) has been the preferred paradigm. However, because it has been long recognized that long-term survival is feasible in a small but non-trivial and growing group of these patients, there has been considerable controversy about intensifying their local therapy by using surgical resection. In fact, there are some data that support improved locoregional control and hence progression-free and even overall survival with trimodality therapy potentially warranting the increase in morbidity. This chapter will focus on reviewing the published evidence supporting the incorporation of surgery into the multimodality treatment of stage IIIA/N2 NSCLC patients. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Treatment options for small cell lung cancer have been stalled for a long time, and new opportunities have emerged in recent years due to the development and initial experience of immunotherapeutic drugs. Clinical trials of some selected immune checkpoint inhibitors have confirmed the efficacy and safety in small cell lung cancer. Based on the results of phase III clinical trials (Impower133 and CASPIAN), Atezolizumab or Durvalumab in combination with chemotherapy has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the first-line treatment of extensive-stage small cell lung cancer.

	abstract = {Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) represents about 13%–15% of all lung cancers. It has a particularly unfavorable prognosis and in about 70% of cases occurs in the advanced stage (extended disease). Three phase III studies tested the combination of immunotherapy (atezolizumab, durvalumab with or without tremelimumab, and pembrolizumab) with double platinum chemotherapy, with practice-changing results. However, despite the high tumor mutational load and the chronic pro-inflammatory state induced by prolonged exposure to cigarette smoke, the benefit observed with immunotherapy is very modest and most patients experience disease recurrence. Unfortunately, biological, clinical, or molecular factors that can predict this risk have not yet been identified. Thanks to these clinically meaningful steps forward, SCLC is no longer considered an “orphan” disease. Innovative treatment strategies and combinations are currently under investigation to further improve the expected prognosis of patients with SCLC. Following the recent therapeutic innovations, we have reviewed the available literature data about SCLC management, with a focus on current unmet needs and potential predictive factors. In detail, the role of radiotherapy; fragile populations, such as elderly or low-performance status patients (ECOG PS 2), usually excluded from randomized studies; predictive factors of response useful to optimize and guide therapeutic choices; and new molecular targets and future combinations have been explored and revised.

	abstract = {Introduction: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a rapidly progressing aggressive malignancy. Durvalumab in CASPIAN and atezolizumab in IMPower133 were found to improve overall survival (OS) for extensive-stage SCLC. Here we evaluate the proportion of real-world ES SCLC patients who may be eligible for first-line immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) with platinum doublet. Methods: A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted of referred ES SCLC between 2015 and 2017 in British Columbia, Canada. Patient demographics, staging, treatment, and survival data were collected through the Cancer Registry. Retrospective chart review was completed to extract past medical history and missing variables. CASPIAN/IMPower133 excluded patients with autoimmune diseases, active infection, and performance status (PS) ≥2. Results: Between 2015 and 2017, 349 patients were diagnosed with ES SCLC. In patients who received platinum-doublet chemotherapy (n=227), 15 had medical contraindication to ICI: inflammatory bowel disease (n=4), rheumatoid arthritis (n=4), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (n=3), lupus (n=1), Sjogren’s (n=1), Takayasu arteritis (n=1), and active tuberculosis (n=1). ECOG PS was 0–1 in 96 (45%), PS was 2 in 61 (29%), and ≥3 in 51 (10%). Prior to cycle 1, 82 (36%) patients were eligible for ICI in addition to platinum doublet, 23% of the entire ES population. After cycles 1 and 2, additional 15 (7%) and 8 (4%) patients became PS 0–1, respectively. mOS for ES SCLC who received first-line platinum doublet, non-platinum chemotherapy, and best supportive care was 8.4 1.9 and 1.5 months (p<0.001). Discussion: By CASPIAN/IMpower133 trial eligibility, only 36% of our real-world platinum-treated patients would have been eligible for the addition of ICI, which is 23% of the entire ES population in one Canadian province. After one or two cycles of chemotherapy, an additional 11% of patients showed PS improvement to 0–1. While the results of CASPIAN/IMpower133 are practice-changing, the majority of the patients will not meet clinical trial eligibility and clinical trials including patients with poor PS are necessary.

	abstract = {Durvalumab consolidation therapy is the standard treatment after concurrent chemoradiotherapy for patients with surgically unresectable stage IIIA (N2) non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgery could reduce locoregional and distant recurrence and improve the survival rate for surgically resectable NSCLC. However, the value of neoadjuvant therapy in locally advanced potentially resectable NSCLC remains controversial. Herein, we report a locally advanced potentially resectable NSCLC case with a history of breast cancer who achieved a pathologic complete response (pCR) after preoperative treatment with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy. A 50-year-old woman developed squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (left lower lobe of the lung, stage IIIA-N2) after two years of chemotherapy and anti-HER2 therapy following a diagnosis of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer. Surgical resection was attempted despite an MDT classification as unamenable to curative surgical resection. After two cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with anti-PD1 immunotherapy, the tumor significantly shrank, then the patient underwent a left lower lobectomy. Complete resection with negative margins (R0 resection) was achieved in the patient. The patient experienced grade 1–2 adverse effects and no grade 3 or worse adverse effects occurred. Cardiotoxicity did not occur in the patient despite prior anti-HER2 treatment for breast cancer. Our case study contributes to the existing evidence on the feasibility, efficacy, and safety of neoadjuvant immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy in locally advanced unresectable NSCLC. Furthermore, future studies are needed to determine which patients can benefit from immunoadjuvant therapy and the duration and course of preoperative and postoperative immunotherapy. © 2022 by the authors.},

This local aggressive therapy (LAT) requires a multidisciplinary approach including medical oncologists, radiation therapists, and thoracic surgeons. A surgical resection of the often advanced primary tumor should be part of the radical treatment whenever feasible. However, patient selection, timing, and a correct treatment allocation for LAT appear to be essential.

	abstract = {The management of breast cancer brain metastases (BCBM) has historically involved local therapies. However, as novel systemic treatments have become more effective in controlling visceral disease, BCBM have also been better controlled. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have demonstrated efficacy in brain metastases in patients with lung cancer and melanoma and represent a promising option for patients with triple-negative BCBM, a group with limited systemic therapy options. In this review we summarize current data about the role of ICIs in the treatment BCBM. We identified 15 clinical trials that evaluated ICIs ± chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer. The studies were mostly focused on triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Of these trials, 4 excluded patients with BCBM, while 11 allowed patients with stable, treated or asymptomatic BCBM. In total, 2692 patients were enrolled in the identified clinical trials, but only 91 trial patients (3.3%) had BCBM. Furthermore, only 2 of these clinical trials reported BCBM-specific outcomes and none of the clinical trials reported BCBM-specific adverse events. Up to 45% of patients with TNBC will develop BCBM; however, only 3.3% of the patients included in the clinical trials that led to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approvals for ICIs in advanced breast cancer had brain metastases. This review reinforces that efficacy data are greatly needed for patients with BCBM—this is an area of unmet need in oncology. More inclusive clinical trials and real-world data that evaluate the safety and efficacy of ICIs in patients with BCBM are greatly needed. © The Author(s) 2022.

	abstract = {This article focuses on development and use of immunotherapy, namely immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), as the treatment of neuroendocrine small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). Considering both remaining quite-high incidence and poor prognosis, these ICI have successfully enriched the existing therapeutic armamentarium against SCLC. If ICI were initially evaluated as maintenance therapy of limited-stage SCLC after concomitant chemoradiotherapy, and as mono/bitherapies for second-line treatment of extensive-stage SCLC, first attempts were not really conclusive. PD-(L)1 inhibitors really proved to be relevant as first-line treatment of extensive-stage SCLC through combination with platine-etoposide chemotherapy. Thus, IMpower133 and CASPIAN studies granted a European marketing approval in this indication for atezolizumab and durvalumab, respectively. However, if the provided benefit might not be denied, an unequivocal predictive biomarker of ICI is still missing while the improvement of SCLC molecular phenotyping is going on. This may confirm that some SCLC subtypes are more likely to respond to ICI, either as combinations or with chemotherapy, and consequently push forward care individualisation of patients suffering from SCLC. © 2022 SPLF.

	abstract = {Non-small cell lung cancer negative for actionable molecular markers entered the splendid era of immunotherapy. This review aims to provide an evidence-based summary for immunotherapy for unresectable locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer, and references for clinical strategies of immunotherapy. Through literature review, the standard treatment for unresectable locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer should be radical concurrent radiotherapy and chemotherapy followed by consolidation immunotherapy. However, the efficacy of concurrent radiotherapy, chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy has not been improved, and its safety should be further validated. It is believed that induction immunotherapy plus concurrent radiotherapy and chemotherapy plus consolidation immunotherapy is promising. In clinical practice, the delineation of radiotherapy target should be relatively small. Pemetrexed combined with PD-1 inhibitor induces the strongest immunogenicity in chemotherapy, which is suggested by preclinical pathway study. Although there is no significant difference between PD1 and PD1 for effect, PD-L1 inhibitor is better in the combination treatment of radiotherapy which presents significantly less adverse events.

	abstract = {The improvement in treatment strategies and outcomes in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) has lagged behind other cancers. The addition of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), durvalumab and atezolizumab, to the platinum-based chemotherapy in frontline setting has improved the survival in extensive stage SCLC, (ES-SCLC), albeit modestly, and is now the new standard of care. Prior to advent of immunotherapy into the therapeutic armamentarium in ES-SCLC, consolidative thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) was associated with improved thoracic control and survival outcomes. In the era of ICIs, the role of TRT is not well defined, chiefly because TRT was not incorporated in any immunotherapy trials, secondly due to concerns regarding the increased risks of pneumonitis, and finally uncertain magnitude of benefit with this combined approach. In principle, radiation can increase in the immunogenicity of tumor and hence the activity of immune checkpoint blockade, thereby increasing efficacy both locally and distantly. Such an approach has been promising in non-small cell lung cancer with ICIs improving outcomes after concurrent chemoradiation, but remains unanswered in ES-SCLC. It is, thus, possible that the modest improvement in survival by addition of ICIs to chemotherapy in ES-SCLC can be further improved by the incorporation of consolidative TRT in selected patients. Several early phase trials and retrospective studies have suggested that such an approach may be feasible and safe. Prospective trials are ongoing to answer whether adding radiation therapy to chemoimmunotherapy will improve outcomes in ES-SCLC. © The Author(s), 2023.},

	abstract = {Background: The composition of the gut microbiota is associated with the response to immunotherapy for different cancers. However, the majority of previous studies have focused on a single cancer and a single immune checkpoint inhibitor. Here, we investigated the relationship between the gut microbiota and the clinical response to anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) immunotherapy in patients with advanced cancers. Method: In this comprehensive study, 16S rRNA sequencing was performed on the gut microbiota of pre-immunotherapy and post-immunotherapy, of 72 advanced cancer patients in China. Results: At the phylum level, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria were the main components of the microbiota in the 72 advanced cancer patients. At the genus level, Bacteroides and Prevotella were the dominant microbiota among these 72 patients. The PD_whole_tree, Chao1, Observed_species and Shannon indices of R.0 and R.T were higher than those of NR.0 and NR.T. The results of LEfSe showed that Archaea, Lentisphaerae, Victivallaceae, Victivallales, Lentisphaeria, Methanobacteriaceae, Methanobacteria, Euryarchaeota, Methanobrevibacter, and Methanobacteriales were significantly enriched in the response group before immunotherapy (R.0), and the Clostridiaceae was significantly enriched in the non-response group before immunotherapy (NR.0) (p < 0.05). Lachnospiraceae and Thermus were significantly enriched in the response group after immunotherapy (R.T), and Leuconostoc was significantly enriched in R.0 (p < 0.05). ROC analysis showed that the microbiota of R.T (AUC = 0.70) had obvious diagnostic value in differentiating Chinese cancer patients based on their response to immunotherapy. Conclusions: We demonstrated that the gut microbiota was associated with the clinical response to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in cancer patients. Taxonomic signatures enriched in responders were effective biomarkers to predict the clinical response. Our findings provide a new strategy to improve the efficiency of responses to immunotherapy among cancer patients. © 2022 by the authors.},

Key mechanisms reviewed below include spatial cooperation, independent cell kill, protection of normal tissues, and finally enhancement of tumor response (i.e., radiosensitization or radio-enhancement). Translation of these principles into clinical trials has slowly enhanced our understanding of each, and revealed potential exploits that can guide us toward further improving the therapeutic ratio in lung cancer treatment.

Recently, adjuvant immunotherapy improved survival for these patients but we are still far from curing most of the patients with only a 57% survival remaining at 3 years. This poor survival is due to the resistance to chemoradiotherapy, local relapses, and distant relapses. Several biological mechanisms have been found to be involved in the chemoradioresistance such as cancer stem cells, cancer mutation status, or the immune system. New drugs to overcome this radioresistance in NSCLCs have been investigated such as radiosensitizer treatments or immunotherapies. Different modalities of radiotherapy have also been investigated to improve efficacity such as dose escalation or proton irradiations. In this review, we focused on biological mechanisms such as the cancer stem cells, the cancer mutations, the antitumor immune response in the first part, then we explored some strategies to overcome this radioresistance in stage III NSCLCs with new drugs or radiotherapy modalities. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICIs) have remarkably modified the way solid tumors are managed, including breast cancer. Unfortunately, only a relatively small number of breast cancer patients significantly respond to these treatments. To maximize the immunotherapy benefit in breast cancer, several efforts are currently being put forward for the identification of i) the best therapeutic strategy (i.e. ICI monotherapy or in association with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or other drugs); ii) optimal timing for administration (e.g. early/advanced stage of disease; adjuvant/neoadjuvant setting); iii) most effective and reliable predictive biomarkers of response (e.g. tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, programmed death-ligand 1, microsatellite instability associated with mismatch repair deficiency, and tumor mutational burden). In this article, we review the impacts and gaps in the characterization of immune-related biomarkers raised by clinical and translational research studies with immunotherapy treatments. Particular emphasis has been put on the documented evidence of significant clinical benefits of ICI in different randomized clinical trials, along with preanalytical and analytical issues in predictive biomarkers pathological assessment. © 2022 Bentham Science Publishers.},

Extensive-stage SCLC (ES-SCLC) is a serious threat to human health, with a 5-year survival rate of <7%. Chemotherapy has been the first-line treatment for the past 30 years. The anti-PD-L1 checkpoint blockades durvalumab and atezolizumab have greatly prolonged overall survival and have become the standard first-line therapy for ES-SCLC since the CASPIAN and IMpower133 trials. In the era of chemotherapy, radiation therapy (RT), including thoracic radiation therapy (TRT) and brain radiation therapy (BRT), has shown clinical effects in randomized and retrospective studies on ES-SCLC. RT-immunotherapy has shown exciting synergistic effects in NSCLC. For ES-SCLC, the clinical effects of combining TRT/BRT with immunotherapy have not yet been systematically explored. In this review, we found that studies on RT-immunotherapy in ES-SCLC are relatively few and limited to early phase studies focusing on toxicity. The efficacy and safety profiles of early phase studies encourage prospective clinical trials. In this review, we discuss the best population, optimum TRT dose, proper TRT time, and strategies for reducing radiation-induced neurotoxicity. Furthermore, we suggest that biomarkers and patient performance status should be fully assessed before RT-immunotherapy treatment. Prospective trials are needed to provide more evidence for RT-immunotherapy applications in ES-SCLC. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Objectives: To investigate the clinical benefits of combination therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and best combination regimen for people with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and to explore the predictive performance of tumour mutation burden (TMB). Methods: We conducted a systematic literature search to identify clinical trials. Meta-analysis and subgroup analyses were performed to estimate the benefits of combination regimens with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors for patients with advanced HCC and compare the effectiveness of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors and sorafenib as first-line therapy. Individualized analysis and Kaplan-Meier were used to assess the prognostic value of TMB. Results: A total of 29 studies with 5396 patients were included. ICIs’ combination therapy had higher ORR (26 % vs 15 %) and DCR (73 % vs 55 %), longer PFS (5.5 vs 3.1 months) and OS (15.9 vs 12.6 months) compared to monotherapy. Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agents provided improved ORR, DCR, PFS and OS compared to sorafenib. The overall ORs of ORR and DCR in subgroup analysis were 3.49 (95 % CI 2.36–5.17, p < 0.01) and 1.60 (95 % CI 1.15–2.21, p < 0.01). The overall HRs of PFS and OS were 0.68 (95 % CI 0.48–0.96, p = 0.03) and 0.73 (95 % CI 0.62–0.85, p < 0.01). PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors plus anti-VEGF agents had an advantage in DCR (0.80 vs 0.48, meta-regression = − 0.32, P < 0.001), but an equal ORR (0.29 vs 0.26) compared to dual immune checkpoint inhibitors. The total OS in Dua-ICIs were 16.5 months (95 % CI 14.2–18.7), yet not reached in the major studies of ICI plus anti-VEGF regimen. In individualized analysis, the 1-year OS was superior for patients who had high-TMB (>10, mutations/Mb) than moderate-TMB (1–10, mutations/Mb; 28 % vs 15 %, P = 0.025). Conclusion: Immune checkpoint inhibitors’ combination therapy improved clinical outcomes in the management of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the overall objective response rate still did not exceed 30%. PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors plus anti-angiogenic agents and dual immunotherapy provided significantly increased survival over sorafenib, which also pose new challenges for future research, and more appropriate and guided control regimens are required. Also, TMB may be a promising prognostic biomarker for immunotherapy in HCC. However, the validation of prospective and large sample studies is needed. © 2022 The Author(s)},

Preclinical studies have shown that in addition to its well-established tumoricidal effects, radiotherapy can activate the host immune system and modify the tumor microenvironment. Immunotherapy is currently part of the therapeutic arsenal of the NSCLC given its capacity to restore the host's immune system's ability to recognize and destroy tumor cells. The combination of radiotherapy and immunotherapy seems to be synergistic, particularly with inhibitors of immune checkpoints. This association has become standard in the metastatic stages and especially in consolidation after radiochemotherapy in the locally advanced, unresectable and stable stages. Several questions remain unanswered including the optimal sequence of this combination, the type of radiotherapy (hypo-fractionated or normofractionated), the association of several immunotherapies and the cross-toxicity of the combination.

They set the age-stratified subgroup analyses at 65 years; however, over half of the patients with lung cancer were newly diagnosed at ≥75 years in Japan. Therefore, treatment efficacy and safety in elderly patients ≥ 75 years with ES-SCLC should be evaluated through real-world Japanese evidence. Consecutive Japanese patients with untreated ES-SCLC or limited-stage SCLC unfit for chemoradiotherapy between 5 August 2019 and 28 February 2022 were evaluated. Patients treated with chemoimmunotherapy were divided into the non-elderly (<75 years) and elderly (≥75 years) groups, and efficacy, including PFS, OS, and post-progression survival (PPS) were evaluated. In total, 225 patients were treated with first-line therapy, and 155 received chemoimmunotherapy (98 non-elderly and 57 elderly patients). The median PFS and OS in non-elderly and elderly were 5.1 and 14.1 months and 5.5 and 12.0 months, respectively, without significant differences. Multivariate analyses revealed that age and dose reduction at the initiation of the first chemoimmunotherapy cycle were not correlated with PFS or OS. In addition, patients with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG-PS) = 0 who underwent second-line therapy had significantly longer PPS than those with ECOG-PS = 1 at second-line therapy initiation (p < 0.001). First-line chemoimmunotherapy had similar efficacy in elderly and non-elderly patients. Individual ECOG-PS maintenance during first-line chemoimmunotherapy is crucial for improving the PPS of patients proceeding to second-line therapy. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Immune checkpoint blockers (ICB) act by reverting the immunosuppressive phenotype of cancer cells, thus allowing host immune system to generate an immune response to the tumor. One of the key mechanisms targeted by ICB is the PD-1/PD-L1 axis, which lies onto the interaction between the programmed-cell death protein 1 and its ligand, overexpressed in several tumor types. This interaction leads to the inhibition of T-cell proliferation and their apoptosis and exhaustion.

	abstract = {Over the past decade, lung cancer treatment has undergone a major paradigm shift. A greater understanding of lung cancer biology has led to the development of many effective targeted therapies as well as of immunotherapy. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have shown tremendous benefit in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and are now being used as first-line therapies in metastatic disease, consolidation therapy following chemoradiation in unresectable locally advanced disease, and adjuvant therapy following surgical resection and chemotherapy in resectable disease. Despite these benefits, predicting who will respond to ICIs has proven to be difficult and there remains a need to discover new predictive immunotherapy biomarkers. Furthermore, resistance to ICIs in lung cancer is frequent either because of a lack of response or disease progression after an initial response. The utility of ICIs in the treatment of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) remains limited to first-line treatment of extensive stage disease in combination with chemotherapy with modest impact on overall survival. It is thus important to explore and exploit additional targets to reap the full benefits of immunotherapy in the treatment of lung cancer. Here, we will summarize the current state of immunotherapy in lung cancer, discuss novel targets, and explore the intersection between DNA repair defects and immunotherapy.

	abstract = {Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting programmed cell death 1, programmed cell death ligand 1, and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 have shown significantly durable clinical benefits and tolerable toxicities and have improved the survival of patients with various types of cancer. Since 2018, the National Medical Products Administration of China has approved 17 ICIs as the standard treatment for certain advanced or metastatic solid tumors. As ICIs represent a broad-spectrum antitumor strategy, the populations eligible for cancer immunotherapy are rapidly expanding. However, the clinical applications of ICIs in cancer patient populations with special issues, a term that refers to complex subgroups of patients with comorbidities, special clinical conditions, or concomitant medications who are routinely excluded from prospective clinical trials of ICIs or are underrepresented in these trials, represent a great real-world challenge. Although the Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology (CSCO) has provided recommendations for screening before the use of ICIs in special populations, the recommendations for full-course management remain insufficient. The CSCO Expert Committee on Immunotherapy organized leading medical oncology and multidisciplinary experts to develop a consensus that will serve as an important reference for clinicians to guide the proper application of ICIs in special patient populations.

	abstract = {Background. Immunotherapy has revolutionized the treatment of advanced lung cancer. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether adding stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) to immunotherapy (IT) further improves responses and survival outcomes. Therefore, in this pooled analysis, we comprehensively compared IT plus SBRT with IT alone in patients with advanced lung cancer. Methods. Online databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane CENTRAL, were systematically searched on April 24, 2022. Eligible studies were randomized clinical trials comparing IT plus SBRT to IT. The primary outcomes were the objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR). Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were explored as secondary outcomes. Results. Overall, three phase 2 randomized clinical trials with a total of 146 previously treated lung cancer patients were enrolled. The median PFS and OS were 3.8 months and 9.5 months for IT plus SBRT versus 2.4 months and 6.1 months for IT. Comparing IT plus SBRT with IT alone, pooled risk ratios for ORR and DCR were 1.95 (95% confidence interval 1.07-3.53, p = 0.03) and 1.28 (0.94-1.73, p = 0.12). While pooled hazard ratios were 0.77 (0.25-2.42, p = 0.66) for PFS and 0.71 (0.16-3.21, p = 0.65) for OS, respectively. No publication bias was found across the trials. Conclusion. Compared to IT alone, the addition of SBRT improved the best response but failed to prolong the survival outcomes in treating advanced lung cancer patients. Future studies are necessary to explore new modalities of the combination of IT and SBRT.  © 2022 Bi-Cheng Wang et al.},

Immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors have played a noteworthy role in contributing to this improved survival, particularly for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, until now the benefits have primarily been seen in patients with advanced or metastatic disease. Several recent early phase and ongoing phase III trials have been assessing whether the treatment benefit of immunotherapy in NSCLC can extend to the neoadjuvant setting for resectable diseases. In this comprehensive narrative review, we evaluate the most recent efficacy and safety data from these studies. We also outline questions that will need to be further examined to legitimate neoadjuvant immunotherapy’s role in NSCLC treatment, including the best surrogate marker of response, the incorporation of liquid biopsy for disease monitoring, the ability to be combined with other treatment modalities, the need for further adjuvant therapy, and potential future treatment combinations. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Background. To assess the prognostic value of pretreatment serum biomarkers in stage IV non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with PD-1 (programmed cell death protein 1) inhibitors and their value as a predictor of benefit. Methods. We performed a retrospective study including patients with stage IV NSCLC who were treated with anti-PD-1 drugs in first or advanced lines of therapy in the Affiliated Tumor Hospital of Nantong University. Serum biomarkers such as NLR, dNLR, LMR, PAB, ALB, and LIPI scores were calculated and analyzed in detail. Results. A total of 85 patients with stage IV NSCLC treated with PD-1 inhibitors in the first or advanced lines of therapy were included in this subject. According to the tumor response of PD-1-based treatment, ORR was 42.4% (36/85) and DCR was 68.2% (58/85). The median OS and PFS were 20.0 months and 7.0 months, respectively. The ROC curves showed that the serum biomarkers of NLR, dNLR, LDH, LMR, PAB, and ALB were significantly associated with overall survival and helped to determine the cut-off value. The multivariate Cox proportional hazard analyses for stage IV NSCLC patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors indicated that dNLR (P<0.001) and ALB (P=0.033) were independent prognostic indicators of PFS, while liver metastasis (P=0.01), NLR (P=0.01), dNLR (P=0.001), and LMR (P=0.006) were independent prognostic indicators of OS. Moreover, patients of the good LIPI group showed prolonged PFS and OS than those with intermediate/poor LIPI score (P<0.001 and P=0.006, respectively). Conclusions. Pretreatment dNLR is an independent prognostic indicator of both PFS and OS in stage IV NSCLC patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors. Pretreatment LIPI, combining dNLR>3 and LDH>ULN, was correlated with worse outcome for stage IV NSCLC patients treated with ICI. High NLR, high dNLR, low LMR, and low ALB at baseline might be useful as an early predictive biomarker of benefit.  © 2022 Jia Chen et al.},

Type I interferons (IFNs) have been demonstrated to inhibit tumor growth directly and indirectly by acting upon tumor and immune cells, respectively. Furthermore, accumulating evidence indicates that endo- and exogenously enhancing type I IFNs have a synergistic effect on anti-tumor immunity. Therefore, clinical trials studying new treatment strategies that combine type I IFN inducers with ICB are currently in progress. Here, we review the cellular sources of type I IFNs and their roles in the immune regulation of the tumor microenvironment. In addition, we highlight immunotherapies based on type I IFNs and combination therapy between type I IFN inducers and ICBs. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Limited-stage small cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC) is a potentially curable disease. However, most patients develop disease relapse shortly after definitive treatment. The landmark trials IMpower133 and CASPIAN demonstrated a survival benefit with the addition of immunotherapy to first-line platinum/etoposide for extensive-stage small cell lung cancer. Therefore, it is critical to determine whether advancements in overall survival with immunotherapy can be translated earlier into the treatment paradigm for LS-SCLC. Decades of robust preclinical research into the synergism of radiation therapy and immunotherapy set the stage for the combination of these treatment modalities. Recently published data suggests tolerability of single agent immunotherapy concurrent with chemoradiation in LS-SCLC, along with promising efficacy. However, combination immunotherapy in the consolidation setting appears too toxic, although this may be reflective of the dosing schedule rather than inherent to any combination immune checkpoint blockade. Here, we review underlying mechanisms of synergy with the combination of radiation and immunotherapy, the safety and efficacy of respective treatment modalities, and the ongoing trials that are exploring novel therapeutic approaches for LS-SCLC. Pivotal trials in LS-SCLC are ongoing and anticipated to aid in understanding efficacy and safety of immunotherapy with concurrent platinum-based chemoradiotherapy. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) is an aggressive disease with poor 5-year survival. The first-line standard-of-care for ES-SCLC is platinum plus etoposide, along with 1 of the immune checkpoint inhibitors atezolizumab or durvalumab. Although SCLC first-line therapy often leads to rapid responses, treatment becomes more challenging at progression, particularly for those with a chemotherapy-free interval (CTFI) of ≤6 months. The NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®) for SCLC no longer specify treatment recommendations in this setting, but options approved by the US Food and Drug Administration include topotecan and lurbinectedin. Participation in a clinical trial is recommended as an option regardless of CTFI. Other NCCN-recommended regimens are paclitaxel, irinotecan, temozolomide, and cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/vincristine, among others. Nivolumab and pembrolizumab are options in those not previously treated with a checkpoint inhibitor. For patients with platinum-sensitive SCLC (CTFI >6 months), preferred treatment per the NCCN Guidelines® for SCLC is retreatment with platinum and etoposide, although the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors is discouraged if there is progression on a drug in this class. Further research on immunotherapies and combination regimens is ongoing, and continuing work on the subcharacterization of SCLC may lead to better precision of therapies that promote more durable responses in individual patients with ES-SCLC.

	abstract = {Purpose: We compared treatment-related pulmonary adverse events (TRPAE), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) among locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who received concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) versus CRT followed by immune check point inhibitor (ICI) immunotherapy (CRTI). Materials and methods: TRPAE was defined as any pulmonary events as defined in CTCAE v.5 occurring within 12 months after completion of radiotherapy. Outcomes were compared between CRT and CTRI by Cox proportional hazard regression and Kaplan-Meier analyses. We also assessed if TRPAE-induced discontinuation of ICI affected survival. Results: We analyzed 326 patients treated between July 2010 and November 2019; 195 patients received CRT and 131 received CRTI. The incidences of severe grade ≥ 3 TRPAE were similar between the two groups, however, symptomatic TRPAE was almost doubled in CRTI group (65.7 % CTRI vs 35.9 % CRT, P < 0.0001). The rates of 4-year OS and PFS were 54.5 % vs 36.7 % (P = 0.0003) and 43.8 % vs 35.8 % (P = 0.038) in CRT + Durvalumab and CRT group, respectively. Receipt of ICI Durvalumab was associated with better 4-year OS (HR 0.53, 95 % CI 0.36–0.78, P = 0.001) and PFS (HR 0.55, 95 % CI 0.38–0.80, P = 0.002). Patients who discontinued ICI because of TRPAE had worse 4-year OS (P = 0.001) and higher rates of distant metastasis (P = 0.003) than those who completed planned ICI after developing TRPAE. Conclusion: CRT followed by adjuvant ICI led to improved 4-year OS and PFS consistent with published data. CRTI was associated with higher incidence of grade ≥ 2 TRPAE in both high and low mean lung dose groups without significant difference in grade ≥ 3 TRPAE. Discontinuation of ICI due to TRPAE was associated with poorer OS and distant disease control than completing ICI as planned after developing TRPAE. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Aim: To compare the efficacy and safety of radiotherapy in combination with immunotherapy after achieving disease control from the first-line combination therapy of platinum-based chemotherapy and immunotherapy for advanced lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). Methods: This study retrospectively evaluated the patients with advanced LUSC treated with the combination of radiotherapy with immunotherapy and chemotherapy (ICRT group, n = 52) or immunotherapy and chemotherapy (ICT group, n = 63) as the first-line treatment from April 2018 to April 2022. Using propensity score matching (PSM), 50 pairs were created, while the confounders and bias were controlled. The objective response rate (ORR), duration of overall response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and adverse events were analyzed in the two groups. The PFS and OS were re-analyzed separately for patients treated with thoracic radiotherapy. Results: After PSM, the median PFS (12.23 vs. 7.43 months; P <0.001) and median OS (19.7 vs. 12.9 months; P <0.001) were significantly longer in the ICRT group than those in the ICT group. Both the PFS and OS rates were also significantly higher in the ICRT group than those in the ICT group, except for the OS rates in the 6th and 12th months. The mDOR of the ICRT group patients (17.10 vs. 8.27 months; P <0.001) was significantly higher than that of the ICT group patients. The median PFS, median OS, and local control rate were significantly longer in the thoracic radiotherapy group than in the control group. Radiation pneumonia was the most common adverse effect after radiotherapy; however, no treatment-related deaths occurred. The Cox regression analysis showed that ECOG scores 0-1, presence of necrosis in the tumor, radiotherapy, and optimal efficacy better than the stable disease (SD) were independent factors, affecting the PFS, while the patients with recurrent post-operative, pre-treatment NLR, radiotherapy, and optimal efficacy better than SD were the independent factors, affecting the OS. Conclusions: The combination of radiotherapy with systematic immunotherapy and chemotherapy for the advanced LUSC was effective with tolerable adverse effects.

	abstract = {Immunotherapies are now emerging as an efficient anticancer therapeutic strategy. Cancer immunotherapy utilizes the host’s immune system to fight against cancer cells and has gained increasing interest due to its durable efficacy and low toxicity compared to traditional antitumor treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy (RT). Although the combination of RT and immunotherapy has drawn extensive attention in the clinical setting, the overall response rates are still low. Therefore, strategies for further improvement are urgently needed. Nanotechnology has been used in cancer immunotherapy and RT to target not only cancer cells but also the tumor microenvironment (TME), thereby helping to generate a long-term immune response. Nanomaterials can be an effective delivery system and a strong autophagy inducer, with the ability to elevate autophagy to very high levels. Interestingly, autophagy could play a critical role in optimal immune function, mediating cell-extrinsic homeostatic effects through the regulation of danger signaling in neoplastic cells under immunogenic chemotherapy and/or RT. In this review, we summarize the preclinical and clinical development of the combination of immunotherapy and RT in cancer therapy and highlight the latest progress in nanotechnology for augmenting the anticancer effects of immunotherapy and RT. The underlying mechanisms of nanomaterial-triggered autophagy in tumor cells and the TME are discussed in depth. Finally, we suggest the implications of these three strategies combined together to achieve the goal of maximizing the therapeutic advantages of cancer therapy and show recent advances in biomarkers for tumor response in the evaluation of those therapies. © The author(s).},

	abstract = {ECOG-ACRIN EA5181 is a current prospective, randomized trial that is investigating whether the addition of concomitant durvalumab to standard chemo/radiation followed by 1 year of consolidative durvalumab results in an overall survival benefit over standard chemo/radiation alone followed by 1 year of consolidative durvalumab in patients with locally advanced, unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Because multiple phase I/II trials have shown the relative safety of adding immunotherapy to chemo/radiation and due to the known synergism between chemotherapy and immunotherapy, it is hoped that concomitant durvalumab can reduce the relatively high incidence of local failure (38%-46%) as seen in recent prospective, randomized trials of standard chemo/radiation in this patient population. We will review the history of radiation for LA-NSCLC and discuss the role of induction, concurrent and consolidative chemotherapy as well as the concerns for late cardiac and pulmonary toxicities associated with treatment. Furthermore, we will review the potential role of next generation sequencing, PD-L1, ctDNA and tumor mutation burden and their possible impact on this trial. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Purpose of reviewSmall cell lung cancer (SCLC) is marked by an exceptionally high proliferative rate and poor prognosis. Given its high propensity to metastasize, nearly two-thirds of SCLC patients are diagnosed with extensive-stage (ES) disease when surgery is not a treatment option anymore. Over several decades, only minimal changes have been made in the therapeutic armamentarium of ES-SCLC. Recently, however, several new therapeutic avenues were defined, thus renewing the hope for patients with this recalcitrant cancer. Here, we present an overview of the most current therapeutic advances in ES-SCLC focusing in particular on consolidative thoracic radiation therapy (cTRT) and chemo-immunotherapy.Recent findingsThe incorporation of immunotherapy in the standard-of-care of ES-SCLC patients and the resulting outcomes are both a remarkable hallmark of progress and a disappointment. Indeed, chemo-immunotherapy with or without cTRT and prophylactic cranial irradiation contributes to longer survival outcomes with minimal toxicity rates in well selected and properly monitored patients. Nevertheless, the gain in overall survival is still modest relative to that seen in many other solid tumors.SummaryDespite the encouraging results, further clinical trials are needed to determine the efficacy and safety of these therapeutic approaches, and moreover, to identify new predictive biomarkers of response. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

However, adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy after surgery has been shown to improve 5-year survival rates by only 4−5%. Immunotherapy using immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has revolutionized the treatment of advanced NSCLC, there is a growing interest in the role of immunotherapy in early-stage NSCLC. Here, we summarize the rationale for adjuvant immunotherapy, including the postoperative immunosuppressive environment and immunological effects of platinum chemotherapy. Many ongoing clinical trials and the related progress in adjuvant immunotherapy in early-stage resectable NSCLC are discussed. Furthermore, we highlight several unresolved challenges, including markers predictive of treatment benefit, the efficacy of treatment for some oncogene-addicted tumors, the optimal combination therapy, the duration of adjuvant immunotherapy, and optimal selection between neoadjuvant and adjuvant immunotherapy. Early findings in some clinical trials are promising, and updated overall survival results will be useful for validating the current role of adjuvant immunotherapy, particularly in the context of perioperative strategy.

	abstract = {Introduction: Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) testing may identify patients at high risk for recurrence following chemoradiation (CRT) for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC). We evaluated the feasibility of ctDNA testing on a readily available commercial fixed-gene panel to predict outcomes in patients with LA-NSCLC. Methods: Plasma of 43 patients was collected at CRT initiation (pre-CRT), completion (post-CRT1), quarterly follow up for 12 months (post-CRT2, 3, 4, 5 respectively) after CRT, and at disease progression. ctDNA analysis was performed using InVisionFirst®-Lung to detect mutations in 36 cancer-related genes. ctDNA clearance was defined as absence of pre-CRT variants at post-CRT1. Patients without detectable pre-CRT variants or no post-CRT1 samples were excluded. Results: Twenty eight of 43 patients (65%) had detectable variants pre-CRT. Nineteen of 43 patients (44%) had detectable pre-CRT variants and post-CRT1 samples and were included in analysis. Median age at diagnosis was 65 years (43-82), and most patients had stage IIIB disease (10/19, 53%). Two patients died from non-cancer related causes before post-CRT2 and were excluded from further analysis. All three patients who did not clear ctDNA had tumor relapse with a median time to relapse of 74 days (30-238), while 50% (7/14) of those who cleared ctDNA have remained disease free. Progression free survival was longer in patients who cleared ctDNA compared to those who did not (median 567 vs 74 d, p = 0.01). Conclusions: Although it is feasible to use ctDNA testing on a limited gene panel to identify patients with LA-NSCLC who are at high risk for disease recurrence following CRT, further studies will be necessary to optimize these assays before they can be used to inform clinical care in patients with lung cancer.

	abstract = {Progress in the overall treatment of small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) has moved at a slower pace than non–small-cell lung cancer. In fact, the standard treatment regimen for limited stage SCLC has not appreciably shifted in more than 20 years, consisting of four to six cycles of cisplatin and etoposide chemotherapy concurrent with thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) followed by prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) for responsive disease. Nevertheless, long-term outcomes have improved with median survival approaching 25-30 months, and approximately one third of patients now survive 5 years. This is likely attributable in part to improvements in staging, including use of brain magnetic resonance imaging and fluorodeoxyglucose–positron emission tomography imaging, advances in radiation treatment planning, and supportive care. The CONVERT and CALGB 30610 phase III trials failed to demonstrate a survival advantage for high-dose, once-daily TRT compared with standard 45 Gy twice-daily TRT, although high-dose, once-daily TRT remains common in practice. A phase III comparison of high-dose 60 Gy twice-daily TRT versus 45 Gy twice-daily TRT aims to confirm the provocative outcomes reported with 60 Gy twice daily in the phase II setting. Efforts over time have shifted from intensifying PCI, to attempting to reduce treatment-related neurotoxicity, to more recently questioning whether careful magnetic resonance imaging surveillance may obviate the routine need for PCI. The addition of immunotherapy has resulted in mixed success in extensive-stage SCLC with modest benefit observed with programmed death-ligand 1 inhibitors, and several ongoing trials assess programmed death-ligand 1 inhibition concurrent or adjuvant to chemoradiotherapy in limited-stage SCLC. Major advances in future treatment will likely depend on a better understanding and exploiting of molecular characteristics of SCLC with increasing personalization of therapy. © 2022 by American Society of Clinical Oncology},

	abstract = {Background: As one of the most common causes of death in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), brain metastases (BM) have attracted attention and debate about treatment options, especially for patients with negative driver genes or resistance to targeted agents. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the potential benefit of different therapeutic regimens for intracranial lesions in non-targeted therapy NSCLC patients. Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted in databases including PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. The primary endpoints included the intracerebral objective response rate (icORR) and intracerebral progression-free survival (iPFS) in patients with BM. Results: Thirty-six studies involving 1,774 NSCLC patients with baseline BM were included in this meta-analysis. Antitumor agents plus radiotherapy (RT) showed the most significant synergistic effects; the highest pooled icORR that appeared in the combination of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) and RT was 81% [95% confidence interval (CI): 16–100%], and the median iPFS was 7.04 months (95% CI: 2.54–11.55 months). The pooled icORR and median iPFS of RT plus chemotherapy were 46% (95% CI: 34–57%) and 5.7 months (95% CI: 3.90–7.50 months), respectively. The highest median iPFS in nivolumab plus ipilimumab plus chemotherapy was 13.5 months (95% CI: 8.35–18.65 months). ICI plus chemotherapy also showed potent antitumor activity in BM, with a pooled icORR of 56% (95% CI: 29–82%) and a median iPFS of 6.9 months (95% CI: 3.20–10.60 months). Notably, the subgroup analysis indicated that the pooled icORR of patients in programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) (≥50%) who received ICI was 54% (95% CI: 30–77%), and that of patients who received first-line ICI was 69.0% (95% CI: 51–85%). Conclusions: ICI-based combination treatment provides a long-term survival benefit for non-targeted therapy patients, with the most significant benefits observed in improving icORR and prolonging overall survival (OS) and iPFS. In particular, patients who received first-line treatment or who were PD-L1-positive had a more significant survival benefit from aggressive ICI-based therapies. For patients with a PD-L1-negative status, chemotherapy plus RT led to better clinical outcomes than other treatment regimens. These innovative findings could help clinicians to better select therapeutic strategies for NSCLC patients with BM. © Translational Lung Cancer Research. All rights reserved.},

These figures are unacceptable since cervical cancer, an human papillomavirus-related malignancy, is a largely preventable disease by means of well-established screening and vaccination programs. Patients with recurrent, persistent, or metastatic disease unsuitable for curative therapeutic approaches represent a dismal prognosis population. Until recently, these patients were only candidates for cisplatin-based chemotherapy plus bevacizumab. However, the introduction of immune checkpoint inhibitors has revolutionized the treatment landscape of this disease achieving historical overall survival improvements in both the post-platinum and frontline settings. Interestingly, the clinical development of immunotherapy in cervical cancer is currently advancing to earlier stages of the disease, as the locally advanced setting, whose standard of care has not changed in the last decades with still modest outcomes. As more innovative immunotherapy approaches are in clinical early development in advanced cervical cancer, promising efficacy data are emerging that may shape the future of this disease.

Whereas at more advanced stages, combined modalities of treatment are applied: radiochemotherapy (IIIB) and molecularly targeted treatment (small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors, VEGF receptor inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, and immunological treatment with monoclonal antibodies). Combination treatment, composed of radiotherapy and molecular therapy, is increasingly employed in locally advanced and metastatic lung cancer management. Recent studies have indicated a synergistic effect of such treatment and modification of immune response. The combination of immunotherapy and radiotherapy may result in the enhancement of the abscopal effect. Anti-angiogenic therapy, in combination with RT, is associated with high toxicity and should be not recommended.

	abstract = {Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) arises in peribronchial locations and infiltrates the bronchial submucosa, including about 15% of lung cancer cases. Despite decades of research, the prognosis for SCLC patients remains poor because this tumor is characterized by an exceptionally high proliferative rate, strong tendency for early widespread metastasis and acquired chemoresistance. Omics profiling revealed that SCLC harbor extensive chromosomal rearrangements and a very high mutation burden. This led to the development of immune-checkpoint inhibitors as single agents or in combination with chemotherapy, which however resulted in a prolonged benefit only for a small subset of patients. Thus, the present review discusses the rationale and limitations of immunotherapeutic approaches, presenting the current biological understanding of aberrant signaling pathways that might be exploited with new potential treatments. In particular, new agents targeting DNA damage repair, cell cycle checkpoint, and apoptosis pathways showed several promising results in different preclinical models. Epigenetic alterations, gene amplifications and mutations can act as biomarkers in this context. Future research and improved clinical outcome for SCLC patients will depend on the integration between these omics and pharmacological studies with clinical translational research, in order to identify specific predictive biomarkers that will be hopefully validated using clinical trials with biomarker-selected targeted treatments. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Aims: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for about 15% of all lung cancers. Chemotherapy, immunotherapy and radiotherapy all play important roles in the management of SCLC. The aim of this study was to provide a comprehensive overview of the role and evidence of radiotherapy in the cure and palliation of SCLC. Materials and methods: The search strategy included a search of the PubMed database, hand searches, reference lists of relevant review articles and relevant published abstracts. ClinicalTrials.gov was also queried for relevant trials. Results: Thoracic radiotherapy improves overall survival in limited stage SCLC, but the timing and dose remain controversial. The role of thoracic radiotherapy in extensive stage SCLC with immunotherapy is the subject of several ongoing trials. Current evidence supports the use of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) for limited stage SCLC but the evidence is equivocal in extensive stage SCLC. Whole brain radiotherapy is well established for the treatment of brain metastases but evidence is rapidly accumulating for the use of stereotactic radiosurgery. Further studies will define the role of PCI, whole brain radiotherapy and hippocampal avoidant PCI in the immunotherapy era. Conclusion: Radiotherapy is an essential component in the multimodality management of SCLC. Technological advances have allowed safer delivery of radiotherapy with reduced toxicities. Discussion at multidisciplinary team meetings is important to ensure radiotherapy is considered and offered in appropriate patients. © 2022},

	abstract = {Lung cancer accounts for approximately 1 in 10 new cancer diagnoses annually and is responsible for the most cancer-associated deaths in Australia. Despite such figures, there is reason for optimism with many practice-changing developments to report for the management of patients with thoracic malignancies over the last few years. We outline such changes, including the emerging role of immunotherapy in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant setting for patients with localised non-small-cell lung cancer, as well as the established standard of consolidation immunotherapy following definitive chemoradiotherapy for those with locally advanced disease. In the metastatic setting, combination chemotherapy–immunotherapy approaches have become the new paradigm for most patients in the absence of a recognised driver mutation. A range of novel targeted therapies now exist and are Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS)-subsidised for targets such as EGFR, ALK and ROS1, with many others, such as KRAS G12C, NTRK, MET, RET and HER2, also with therapies rapidly being developed. Even among patients with small-cell lung cancer, who account for the worst prognoses and until recently have received a chemotherapy regimen that has remained unchanged in over 20 years, there is a new standard-of-care in combination chemotherapy–immunotherapy. Furthermore, immunotherapy and potentially anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents now also play a role in mesothelioma treatment. Last, given recent developments in immunotherapy, targeted therapy and combination approaches in the non-small-cell lung cancer space, there is an increasing recognition of the diversity of lived experience for such patients and need for survivorship programmes to acknowledge such nuances. © 2021 Royal Australasian College of Physicians.},

Compared to chemotherapy patients, the 5-year survival rate for immunotherapy patients is 3-fold higher, approximately 4%–5% versus 15%–16%, respectively. Immunotherapies include chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy, tumor vaccines, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and so forth. Among them, immune checkpoint inhibitors are in the spotlight. Common immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) currently in clinical use include programmed death receptor-1(PD-1)/programmed death ligand-1(PD-L1) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4(CTLA-4). This article focuses on monotherapy and combination therapy of CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors. In particular, the combination therapy of ICIs includes the combination of ICIs and chemotherapy, the combination therapy of dual ICIs, the combination of ICIs and anti-angiogenic drugs, the combination of ICIs and radiotherapy, and the combination of ICIs inhibitors and tumor vaccines and so forth. This article focuses on the combination therapy of ICIs with chemotherapy, the combination therapy of dual ICIs, and the combination therapy of ICIs with anti-angiogenic drugs. The efficacy and safety of ICIs as single agents in NSCLC have been demonstrated in many trials. However, ICIs plus chemotherapy regimens offer significant advantages in the treatment of NSCLC with little to no dramatic increase in toxicity, while combined dual ICIs significantly reduce the adverse effects (AEs) of chemotherapy. ICIs plus anti-angiogenic agents regimen improves anti-tumor activity and safety and is expected to be the new paradigm for the treatment of advanced NSCLC. Despite some limitations, these agents have achieved better overall survival rates. In this article, we review the current status and progress of research on ICIs in NSCLC in recent years, aiming to better guide the individualized treatment of NSCLC patients.

	abstract = {In China, lung cancer is a primary cancer type with high incidence and mortality. Risk factors for lung cancer include tobacco use, family history, radiation exposure, and the presence of chronic lung diseases. Most early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients miss the optimal timing for treatment due to the lack of clinical presentations. Population-based nationwide screening programs are of significant help in increasing the early detection and survival rates of NSCLC in China. The understanding of molecular carcinogenesis and the identification of oncogenic drivers dramatically facilitate the development of targeted therapy for NSCLC, thus prolonging survival in patients with positive drivers. In the exploration of immune escape mechanisms, programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor monotherapy and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor plus chemotherapy have become a standard of care for advanced NSCLC in China. In the Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology's guidelines for NSCLC, maintenance immunotherapy is recommended for locally advanced NSCLC after chemoradiotherapy. Adjuvant immunotherapy and neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy will be approved for resectable NSCLC. In this review, we summarized recent advances in NSCLC in China in terms of epidemiology, biology, molecular pathology, pathogenesis, screening, diagnosis, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy. © 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {Introduction: Oncological treatments are changing rapidly due to the advent of several targeted anticancer drugs and regimens. The primary new area of research in oncological medicine is the implementation of a combination of novel therapies and standard care. In this scenario, radioimmunotherapy is one of the most promising fields, as proven by the exponential growth of publications in this context during the last decade. Areas covered: This review provides an overview of the synergistic use of radiotherapy and immunotherapy and addresses questions like the importance of this subject, aspects clinicians look for in patients to administer this combined therapy, individuals who would benefit the most from this treatment, how to achieve abscopal effect and when does radio-immunotherapy become standard clinical practice. Expert opinion: Answers to these queries generate further issues that need to be addressed and solved. The abscopal and bystander effects are not utopia, rather physiological phenomena that occur in our bodies. Nevertheless, substantial evidence regarding the combination of radioimmunotherapy is lacking. In conclusion, joining forces and finding answers to all these open questions is of paramount importance. © 2023 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Immunotherapy can be considered a therapeutic revolution in oncology, with great impact on many tumor types, such as melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer. However, in metastatic colo-rectal cancer, the benefits in terms of prolonged tumor control and high response rate are limited to the rare subgroup of tumors with high mutation burden-mostly tumors that harbor microsatellite instability (MSI) or a deficient mismatch repair system (dMMR), or tumor microsatellite stability and damag-ing mutations in the exonuclease domains of POLE or POLD. The KEYNOTE-028 uncontrolled phase II trial demonstrated an impressive antitumor activity of pembrolizumab in patients with treatment-refractory Lynch-associated tumors, including colorectal cancer. Nivolumab with or without ipili-mumab confirmed the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with previously treated dMMR / MSI metastatic colorectal cancer. The recent KEYNOTE-177 phase III trial demonstrated that pembrolizumab significantly reduced the relative risk of disease progression or death and improved progression-free survival in patients with treatment-naive dMMR / MSI metastatic colorectal cancer in comparison with first-line chemotherapy with or without biologics. Unfortunately, current pharmacological strategies with immunotherapy have not been successful for most patients with mi-crosatellite stable metastatic colorectal cancer. In this review, we critically appraise the applicability of immune checkpoint inhibitors in dMMR/MSI metastatic colorectal cancer. We also discuss the recent negative trials of immunotherapy combinations in microsatellite stable tumors and more mature immu-notherapy ongoing studies in the field of advanced colorectal cancer. © 2022 Bentham Science Publishers.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) has been the standard of care for patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC). Background and Purpose: The results of the PACIFIC trial established the use of consolidative durvalumab after concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) as the standard of care for patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC). A subgroup analysis of the PACIFIC trial reported a better progression-free survival (PFS) in Asians. Although real-world data on LA-NSCLC patients who received CCRT plus durvalumab have been reported, there have been few large-scale reports on Asians. In this study, we investigated prognostic factors in the largest real-world data set in Asia of only Japanese LA-NSCLC patients treated with CCRT plus durvalumab. Materials and Methods: One hundred and thirteen LA-NSCLC patients who received definitive CCRT and consolidative durvalumab at our institution between May 2018 and April 2021 were analyzed. Overall survival (OS), cause-specific survival (CSS), PFS, distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), and in-field progression-free survival (IFPFS) were investigated as treatment outcomes using competing risk analyses. Results: During a median follow-up of 24 months (range, 5–47) after the initiation of durvalumab therapy, 31 patients died, of whom 23 died of lung cancer. In the multivariate analysis, the pretreatment factors that correlated with OS were ILA scores, adenocarcinoma, and performance status at the initiation of durvalumab. Furthermore, ILA score and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) tumor proportion score (TPS) ≥ 1 % were significantly correlated with CSS, and PD-L1 TPS ≥ 1 % was significantly correlated with PFS and IFPFS. Conclusion: Pretreatment ILA, adenocarcinoma, and performance status may have an impact on OS of LA-NSCLC patients receiving CCRT plus durvalumab. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Purpose of Review: The use of single-agent or combination immunotherapy strategies has revolutionized the management of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Here, we review the current role for CTLA-4 inhibitors in early-stage resectable NSCLC, unresectable stage III NSCLC, and in metastatic NSCLC. Recent Findings: Immunotherapy agents alone, or in combination with chemotherapy, represent the new standard of care for the management of metastatic squamous and non-squamous NSCLC without driver mutations. Combination CTLA-4 and PD-1/L1 inhibitors can be efficacious, particularly in tumor mutation burden (TMB) high tumors, providing a chemotherapy-free strategy for metastatic patients. Early signals from neoadjuvant trials suggest a benefit for combination CTLA-4 and PD-1 inhibitions prior to surgery, with improved rates of major pathologic response (MPR). The role for CTLA4 inhibitors is currently unknown in the adjuvant and unresectable stage III setting, although clinical trials are ongoing to evaluate this approach. Summary: There is a growing role for CTLA-4 inhibition in the neoadjuvant and metastatic settings for patients with NSCLC. Biomarker selection in ongoing clinical trials will be crucial to guide patient selection for CTLA4 inhibitor therapy. Combination strategies with PD-1/L1 inhibition have demonstrated the greatest efficacy to date. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Background: The data about efficacy of immunotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer with brain metastases (BMs) from real-word settings are controversial. This real-word study is aimed to evaluate the clinical outcome of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-based treatment in lung adenocarcinoma patients with brain metastases (BMs) and explore potential risk factors, with a focus on the spatial distribution of BMs as previous studies suggested spatial heterogeneity on the brain immune microenvironment. Methods: Advanced lung adenocarcinoma patients with non-oncogene-addicted, who received ICI monotherapy or plus chemotherapy, were enrolled. Efficacy was assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1. Intergroup comparisons were performed using Pearson's x2 or Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables. The progression-free survival (PFS) was estimated using Kaplan-Meier method and compared using log-rank test. Cox proportional hazards model was used for multivariate analyses. Peripheral blood was collected from 15 patients with BMs. Tumor-derived exosomes in plasma were isolated by size exclusion chromatography and the cDNA library preparations for miRNA were sequenced on an Illumina Hiseq platform. Differentially expressed genes in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways were analyzed. Results: A total of 198 patients were enrolled and brain metastasis occurred in 20.7% patients (N=41). Compared with patients without BMs, those with BMs had a comparable objective response rate (ORR; 29.3% vs. 43.9%; P=0.089), a lower disease control rate (DCR; 58.5% vs. 78.3%; P=0.01), and a shorter PFS (3.6 vs. 8.6 months; P=0.069). For patients with BMs, factors, including the presence of neurological symptoms, the treatment of intracranial radiotherapy, and the combination of ICI with chemotherapy, had no impact on PFS, whereas cerebellum metastasis was significantly associated with shorter PFS (2.8 vs. 13.8 months, P=0.007). Six upregulated miRNAs were identified in patients with cerebellum metastases (N=8) compared with those without (N=7). The enrichment of differentially expression genes in the KEGG pathways indicated upregulated sulfur metabolism pathway in patients with cerebellum metastases. Conclusions: For lung adenocarcinoma patients, those with BMs have inferior response to ICI-based treatment, but not significantly, and cerebellum metastasis is an independent risk factor with poor outcome for such patients, might attributing to the upregulated sulfur metabolism. © 2022 AME Publishing Company.

Although newer treatments are being incorporated in the relapse setting, marked therapeutic resistance is typically observed in patients with relapsed small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), underscoring the need of developing more effective therapies in this setting. Notably, recent progress in the understanding of the molecular biology of SCLC might bring possibilities toward molecularly informed therapeutic strategies for patients with SCLC, which could have a significant impact for improving outcomes in this disease.

	abstract = {Esophageal cancer (EC) is one of the most life-threatening malignancies worldwide. Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is the dominant subtype, accounting for approximately 90% of new incident EC each year. Although multidisciplinary treatment strategies have advanced rapidly, patients with ESCC are often diagnosed at advanced stage and the long-term prognosis remains unsatisfactory. In recent decades, immunotherapy, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), tumor vaccines, and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy, has been successfully used in clinical practice as a novel therapy for treating tumors, bringing new hope to ESCC patients. However, only a small fraction of patients achieved clinical benefits due to primary or acquired resistance. Immune evasion plays a pivotal role in the initiation and progression of ESCC. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the mechanisms by which ESCC cells escape from anti-tumor immunity is necessary for a more effective multidisciplinary treatment strategy. It has been widely recognized that immune evasion is closely associated with the crosstalk between tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment (TME). TME is a dynamic complex and comprehensive system including not only cellular components but also non-cellular components, which influence hallmarks and fates of tumor cells from the outside. Novel immunotherapy targeting tumor-favorable TME represents a promising strategy to achieve better therapeutic responses for patients with ESCC. In this review, we provide an overview of immune evasion in ESCC, mainly focusing on the molecular mechanisms that underlie the role of TME in immune evasion of ESCC. In addition, we also discuss the challenges and opportunities of precision therapy for ESCC by targeting TME. Copyright © 2023 Li, Huang, Tian and Sun.},

	abstract = {Due to the high variance in response rates concerning anti-PD1 immunotherapy (IT), there is an unmet need to discover innovative biomarkers to predict immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-efficacy. Our study included 62 Caucasian advanced-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with anti-PD1 ICI. Gut bacterial signatures were evaluated by metagenomic sequencing and correlated with progression-free survival (PFS), PD-L1 expression and other clinicopathological parameters. We confirmed the predictive role of PFS-related key bacteria with multivariate statistical models (Lasso- and Cox-regression) and validated on an additional patient cohort (n = 60). We find that alpha-diversity showed no significant difference in any comparison. However, there was a significant difference in beta-diversity between patients with long- (>6 months) vs. short (≤6 months) PFS and between chemotherapy (CHT)-treated vs. CHT-naive cases. Short PFS was associated with increased abundance of Firmicutes (F) and Actinobacteria phyla, whereas elevated abundance of Euryarchaeota was specific for low PD-L1 expression. F/Bacteroides (F/B) ratio was significantly increased in patients with short PFS. Multivariate analysis revealed an association between Alistipes shahii, Alistipes finegoldii, Barnesiella visceriola, and long PFS. In contrast, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus vestibularis, and Bifidobacterium breve were associated with short PFS. Using Random Forest machine learning approach, we find that taxonomic profiles performed superiorly in predicting PFS (AUC = 0.74), while metabolic pathways including Amino Acid Synthesis and Fermentation were better predictors of PD-L1 expression (AUC = 0.87). We conclude that specific metagenomic features of the gut microbiome, including bacterial taxonomy and metabolic pathways might be suggestive of ICI efficacy and PD-L1 expression in NSCLC patients. © 2023 The Author(s).

According to WHO, 30% of NSCLC patients can be cured if diagnosed and treated early. Mutations play an important role in advanced stage NSCLC treatment, which includes critical proteins necessary for cellular growth and replication. Restricting such mutations may improve survival in lung cancer patients. Newer technologies include endoscopic bronchial ultrasonography and esophageal ultrasonography. Currently, policymaking or decision-making for treatment regimens merely depends on the genomic alterations and mutations. DNA sequencing, methylation, protein, and fragmented DNA analysis do NSCLC screening. Achievement of these goals requires consideration of available therapeutics in current anticancer approaches for improving quality of life and treatment outcomes for NSCLC patient. The specific goals of this review are to discuss first-line and second-line therapies for advanced-stage NSCLC and molecularly targeted therapy including thoughtful discussion on precise role of treatment strategies in specific tumors. Also, concerned diagnostics, new clinical trial designs, and pursuing appropriate combinations of radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy with biological therapy for exceptional cases considering resistance mechanisms and palliative care will be discussed.

	abstract = {Immunotherapy has achieved great success recently and opened a new avenue for anti-tumor treatment. Programmed cell death 1/programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) are typical immune checkpoints that transmit coinhibitory signals, muting the host immunity. Monoclonal antibodies that block PD-1/PD-L1 axis have benefited many patients with different tumor diseases. However, the objective response rate is still unsatisfactory. In this review, we summarize three strategies targeting PD-L1 based on different forms of PD-L1 and various regulating mechanisms to enhance the therapeutic effect, including blockade of the interaction between PD-L1 and PD-1, downregulation of PD-L1 expression and degradation of mature PD-L1. Thereinto, we describe a variety of materials have been designed to target PD-L1, including antibodies, nanoparticle, peptide, aptamer, RNA, and small molecule. Additionally, we list the drugs with PD-L1 regulation capacity used in clinical and ongoing studies to explore other alternatives for targeting PD-L1 besides anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies. Moreover, we discuss associated opportunities for cancer combination therapy with other modalities such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT), as these conventional or emerging modalities are capable of increasing the immune response of tumor cells by altering the tumor microenvironment (TME), and would display synergistic effect. At last, we give a brief summary and outlook regarding the research status and future prospect of immunotherapy. © The author(s).},

We conducted a first-in-human study of 68Ga-NOTA-WL12 for PET to study the in vivo biodistribution, metabolism, radiation dosimetry, safety, and potential for quantifying programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression levels in patients with advanced non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods: In vitro assessment of the PD-L1 expression and cellular uptake of 68Ga-NOTA-WL12 was performed, followed by in vivo evaluation of 68Ga-NOTA-WL12 uptake in mouse models with tumors. Nine patients with NSCLC with lesions expressing PD-L1 were enrolled and monitored for adverse events during the study. 68Ga-NOTA-WL12 and paired 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging were performed. Uptake (SUV, SUL [SUVlean], and kBq/mL) values of tumors and normal organs were obtained. Radiopharmaceutical biodistribution, radiation dosimetry, and the relationship of tumor uptake to PD-L1 expression were evaluated. Follow-up 18F-FDG PET/CT was performed in patients who had undergone treatment with a combination of pembrolizumab with chemotherapy. Results: 68Ga-NOTA-WL12 exhibited PD-L1– specific uptake in vitro and in PD-L1–positive tumors in vivo. 68Ga-NOTA-WL12 PET imaging proved safe with acceptable radiation dosimetry. Physiologic tracer uptake was mainly visible in the liver, spleen, small intestine, and kidney. Tumors were clearly visible, particularly in the lungs, with a tumor-to-lung ratio of 4.45 6 1.89 at 1 h. One hour was a suitable time point for image acquisition because no significant differences were noted in tumor-to-background ratios between 1 and 2 h. A strong, positive correlation was found between tumor uptake (SUVpeak) and PD-L1 immunohistochemistry results (r 5 0.9349; P 5 0.002). 68Ga-NOTA-WL12 and 18F-FDG PET studies suggest that PD-L1 PET before therapy may indicate the therapeutic efficacy of pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy combination treatment. Conclusion: Our first-in-human findings demonstrate the safety and feasibility of 68Ga-NOTA-WL12 for noninvasive, in vivo detection of tumor PD-L1 expression levels, indicating potential benefits for clinical PD-L1 therapy.

	abstract = {Objectives: Brain metastases (BMs) are common in extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) and are underrepresented in pivotal clinical trials that demonstrate the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). We conducted a retrospective analysis to assess the role of ICIs in BM lesions in less selected patients. Materials and methods: Patients with histologically confirmed extensive-stage SCLC who were treated with ICIs were included in this study. Objective response rates (ORRs) were compared between the with-BM and without-BM groups. Kaplan−Meier analysis and the log-rank test were used to evaluate and compare progression-free survival (PFS). The intracranial progression rate was estimated using the Fine-Gray competing risks model. Results: A total of 133 patients were included, 45 of whom started ICI treatment with BMs. In the whole cohort, the overall ORR was not significantly different for patients with and without BMs (p = 0.856). The median progression-free survival for patients with and without BMs was 6.43 months (95% CI: 4.70-8.17) and 4.37 months (95% CI: 3.71-5.04), respectively (p =0.054). In multivariate analysis, BM status was not associated with poorer PFS (p = 0.101). Our data showed that different failure patterns occurred between groups, with 7 patients (8.0%) without BM and 7 patients (15.6%) with BM having intracranial-only failure as the first site progression. The cumulative incidences of brain metastases at 6 and 12 months were 15.0% and 32.9% in the without-BM group and 46.2% and 59.0% in the BM group, respectively (Gray’s p<0.0001). Conclusions: Although patients with BMs had a higher intracranial progression rate than patients without BMs, the presence of BMs was not significantly associated with a poorer ORR and PFS with ICI treatment in multivariate analysis.

	abstract = {Background: The safety of salvage lung resection after immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is not well understood. Methods: In this retrospective multicenter study, we reviewed perioperative morbidity and mortality rates in 11 patients (8 men, 3 women; median age 70 years) who underwent salvage lung resection for unresectable NSCLC after ICI therapy in the 4 years since 2017. Operative factors were also compared according to operating time (> 6 h, n = 7; < 6 h, n = 4). Results: The clinical stage at the time of diagnosis was IIIA in 2 patients, IIIB in 4, IVA in 2, and IVB in 3. Eight patients received pembrolizumab and 3 received durvalumab. Two patients received an ICI agent alone, 3 underwent chemoradiotherapy, and 6 received chemotherapy. Lobectomy was performed in 10 cases and bilobectomy in 1 case. All patients underwent complete resection. Median operating time was 429 (range 169–570) min with a median blood loss of 199 (range 10–5, 140) mL. The only intraoperative complication was damage to the pulmonary artery. The perioperative morbidity and mortality rates were 27% and 0%, respectively. The 90-day mortality rate was 9% (1 patient died of acute exacerbation of interstitial pneumonia). Patients in whom the operating time was > 6 h more frequently had lymph node metastasis at the time of initial diagnosis (100% vs 25%, p = 0.02). Conclusions: Salvage lung resection was tolerated after ICI therapy in these patients. Lymph node metastasis at the time of initial diagnosis might make salvage surgery difficult. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Japanese Association for Thoracic Surgery.},

	abstract = {Small cell lung cancer is a highly lethal subtype of lung cancer, characterized by early dissemination and poor survival. Classically, it arises centrally and often presents with symptoms related to local obstruction of airways or blood vessels. When detected at a relatively early stage, definitive thoracic radiation coupled with platinum-based chemotherapy offers high response rates, but long-term survival will be achieved only by a small minority of patients. Most patients present with advanced disease at diagnosis. In the advanced or relapsed setting, systemic chemotherapy has been the standard of care for decades. Response rates are high but progression free, and overall survival are limited. The standard of care was stagnant for many years, but recent advances in immunotherapy have led to better outcomes. The addition of the checkpoint inhibitor atezolizumab to standard chemotherapy led to a significant improvement in overall survival, the first intervention to do so in decades. A subsequent trial demonstrated similar improvement with the addition of durvalumab to chemotherapy. While combination chemotherapy plus immunotherapy has established a new standard of care, survival is poor for most patients and more effective treatment strategies remain an unmet need. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Purpose of Review: This review aspires to summarize the landmark advancements in the management of the non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), both historically and contemporarily with special focus in older adults. Recent Findings: The past two decades have witnessed remarkable improvements in the diagnosis and management of lung cancer. Screening recommendations now facilitate earlier diagnosis in high-risk individuals, PET/CT scans have improved radiologic accuracy in identifying sites of disease, and surgical management with minimally invasive techniques has rendered surgery safer in those with limited physiologic reserve. Radiation enhancements, especially radiosurgery, have extended the reach and safety of radiation among high-risk populations. Finally, the revolution in precision medicine with identification of numerous actionable mutations, the advent of immunotherapy, and enhanced supportive care have revolutionized the outcomes in patients with advanced lung cancer. Summary: Older adults who represent a majority of patients battling lung cancer have not benefitted to the same extent as their younger counterparts. This special population is only expected to grow in coming days. Hence, addressing major gaps in the management of older adults with NSCLC and optimizing the care are much needed. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

The recent development of immune checkpoint inhibitors has afforded a durable, dramatic treatment response for a subset of patients, but strategies to expand these benefits to a broader swath of patients are needed. Preliminary evidence suggests radiotherapy may modulate a patient's immune system, particularly when delivered in high doses over few fractions with conformal techniques, as with stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR). Radiotherapy for advanced stage NSCLC has traditionally been administered with palliative intent. However, an emergence of data from retrospective studies and, more recently, prospective trials has indicated the potential of using stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR), in combination with systemic immunotherapy agents have synergistic effect and may enhance survival. We review current evidence for synergy between radiation and immunotherapy in metastatic, locally advanced, and localized NSCLC and discuss ongoing studies. © 2020},

	abstract = {The brain is one of the most common metastatic sites in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which is associated with an extremely poor prognosis. Despite the availability of several therapeutic options, the treatment efficacy remains unsatisfactory for NSCLC brain metastases. Anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1) monoclonal antibodies have reshaped therapeutic strategies in advanced NSCLC. Preliminary evidence has shown that anti-PD-(L)1 monotherapy is also effective in NSCLC patients with brain metastases. However, the traditional view asserted that these therapeutic antibodies were incapable of crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB) with large molecular size, thus most patients with brain metastases were excluded from most studies on anti-PD-(L)1 immunotherapy. Therefore, the efficacy and its mechanisms of action of anti-PD-(L)1 immunotherapy against brain metastases in NSCLC have not been clarified. In this review, we will survey the underlying mechanisms and current clinical advances of anti-PD-(L)1 immunotherapy in the treatment of brain metastases in NSCLC. The trafficking of activated cytotoxic T cells that are mainly derived from the primary tumor and deep cervical lymph nodes is critical for the intracranial response to anti-PD-(L)1 immunotherapy, which is driven by interferon-γ (IFN-γ). Additionally, promising combined strategies with the rationale in the treatment of brain metastases will be presented to provide future directions for clinical study design. Several significant challenges in the preclinical and clinical studies of brain metastases, as well as potential solutions, will also be discussed. © 2021},

	abstract = {Radiotherapy (RT) and chemotherapy continue to be widely utilized in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) management. In most limited stage (LS)-SCLC cases, the standard initial therapy remains concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT), typically with an etoposide and platinum-based regimen. Hyperfractionated twice daily (BID) RT remains the standard of care, though conventional daily (QD) RT is now a viable alternative supported by randomized evidence. In LS-SCLC patients who experienced good response to CRT, prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) remains the standard of care. Brain imaging, ideally with MRI, should be performed prior to PCI to screen for clinically apparent brain metastases that may require a higher dose of cranial irradiation. Platinum doublet chemotherapy alone is the historic standard initial therapy in extensive stage (ES)-SCLC. Addition of immunotherapy such as atezolizumab and durvalumab to chemotherapy is now recommended after their benefits were demonstrated in recent trials. In patients with response to chemotherapy, consolidation thoracic RT and PCI could be considered, though with caveats. Emergence of hippocampal avoidance cranial irradiation and SRS in SCLC patients may supplant whole cranial irradiation as future standards of care. Incorporation of novel systemic therapies such as immunotherapies has changed the treatment paradigm and overall outlook of patients with SCLC. This narrative review summarizes the current state, ongoing trials, and future directions of radiotherapy in management of SCLC. © Copyright © 2020 Tjong, Mak, Shahi, Li, Chen and Louie.},

	abstract = {Background: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is highly invasive and fatal, sensitive to chemotherapy and radiotherapy but prone to relapse, with a poor overall survival rate. It is particularly urgent for SCLC patients to receive effective follow-up treatment. In the past 20 years, there has been no breakthrough in clinical treatment of SCLC. Currently, clinical studies on immunotherapy for SCLC with extensive stage disease (ED) have achieved good efficacy, bringing new hope for the treatment of small-cell lung cancer. PD-1 inhibitors used to treat small cell lung cancer include Pembrolizumab and Nivolumab. PD-L1 inhibitors mainly include Atezolizumab and Durvalumab. Other PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, such as Avelumab, are currently being tried for SCLC and the results have not yet been published. This study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of immunotherapy in patients with ED SCLC. Methods: A literature search of the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were performed. Two reviewers independently screened the literature, extracted the data, and evaluated the risk of bias of the included studies. RevMan 5.3 software was used for meta-analysis. Results: Four studies involving 1,981 patients with ED SCLC were included. Both overall survival (OS) [hazard ratio (HR) =0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) (0.68, 0.95), P=0.009] and progression-free survival (PFS) [HR =0.82, 95% CI (0.75, 0.90), P <0.00001] were longer in the immunotherapy group than in the chemotherapy group. The incidence of total treatment-related adverse events in the immunotherapy group were lower than those in the chemotherapy group [relative risk (RR) =1.050, 95% CI (1.010, 1.080), P=0.007], and the differences were statistically significant. Conclusions: Immunotherapy has better efficacy and safety than chemotherapy for the treatment of ED SCLC. © Annals of Palliative Medicine. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Cancer cells can evade immune surveillance in the body. However, immune checkpoint inhibitors can interrupt this evasion and enhance the antitumor activity of T cells. Other mechanisms for promoting antitumor T-cell function are the targeting of costimulatory molecules expressed on the surface of T cells, such as 4-1BB, OX40, inducible T-cell costimulator and glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor. In addition, CD40 targets the modulation of the activation of antigen-presenting cells, which ultimately leads to T-cell activation. Agonists of these costimulatory molecules have demonstrated promising results in preclinical and early-phase trials and are now being tested in ongoing clinical trials. In addition, researchers are conducting trials of combinations of such immune modulators with checkpoint blockade, radiotherapy and cytotoxic chemotherapeutic drugs in patients with advanced tumors. This review gives a comprehensive picture of the current knowledge of T-cell agonists based on their use in recent and ongoing clinical trials. © Author(s) 2020.},

	abstract = {Background: Recent phase II–III trials of immuno(chemo)therapy before resection in locally advanced resectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) report high rates of pathological response and promising survival. However, primarily, patients who did not undergo resection were excluded from these studies. Moreover, there are no data on chemoradiotherapy (CRT) after immuno(chemo)therapy in patients who are primarily not amenable to CRT. We hypothesised that induction immuno(chemo)therapy may enable patients with NSCLC with a potentially curative stage (III–IVA), for whom primary curative treatment (either resection or CRT) is not possible for anatomical or functional reasons, to receive curative treatment. Patients and methods: We enrolled 35 patients with NSCLC with aforementioned characteristics into a prospective real-world trial of induction immuno(chemo)therapy followed by morphologic and metabolic reassessment and multidisciplinary board-guided curative treatment (resection [preferred] or CRT) or palliative therapy. The primary end-point was the proportion of patients receiving curative treatment. Results: Thirty-two patients (91%) received curative treatment (11 resections and 21 CRT). 73% and 64% of patients who underwent resection had a major or complete pathological response, respectively. There were 14 recurrences: 2 (18%) in patients who underwent resection, 9 (43%) in patients who received CRT and 3 (100%) in patients who received palliative therapy (median follow-up 17 months). Eight tumour-related deaths occurred: 5 (24%) in patients who received CRT; and 3 (100%) in patients who received palliative therapy. There were no treatment-related deaths. Conclusions: In locally advanced or oligometastatic NSCLC without a primary curative option, induction immuno(chemo)therapy results in a high rate of curative treatment with promising early survival data. patients who underwent resection achieved a high rate of prognostically favourable pathological response. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have improved the overall survival of many patients with advanced cancers. However, unlike cytotoxic and targeted drugs, ICIs may cause various immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Among these irAEs, autoimmune meningitis is very rare. Here, we report a case of early-onset, atezolizumab-induced meningitis after administration of one dose of atezolizumab. A 56-year-old man with lung adenocarcinoma had received seventh-line treatment with atezolizumab when he experienced dysarthria. Blood examinations, including the measurement of electrolytes, glucose, and organ functions, were unremarkable, but enhanced head magnetic resonance imaging T1-weighted images showed meningeal enhancement. Although cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) examinations revealed elevated lymphocyte and protein levels, no cancer cells were detected in the CSF. CSF cultures and serological tests, including polymerase chain reaction for herpes simplex virus, were negative. The patient was therefore diagnosed with atezolizumab-triggered autoimmune meningitis. With steroid treatment, the patient’s clinical and neurological state improved immediately and he recovered to baseline conditions. Prompt diagnosis and therapeutic intervention are essential for the effective treatment of autoimmune meningitis. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Standard curative treatment of early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) involves surgery in combination with postoperative (adjuvant) platinum-based chemotherapy where indicated. Preoperative (neoadjuvant) therapies offer certain theoretical benefits compared with adjuvant approaches, including the ability to assess on-treatment response, reduce the tumor bulk prior to surgery, and enhance tolerability in the preoperative setting. Indeed, the use of neoadjuvant therapies are well established in other cancers such as breast and rectal cancers to debulk the tumor and guide ongoing therapy, and neoadjuvant chemotherapy has similar efficacy but less toxicity in NSCLC. More recently, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) targeting programmed death-1 (PD1)/PD1-ligand 1 (PD-L1) have transformed the treatment of advanced NSCLC; the unique mechanisms of action of ICI offer additional rationale for assessment in the neoadjuvant setting. Preclinical studies in mouse cancer models support the proof of concept of neoadjuvant ICI (NAICI) through improvement of T-cell effector function and long-term memory induction. Preliminary early-phase human trial data support the proposition that NAICI in NSCLC may provide an feasible and potentially efficacious future treatment strategy and large, randomized phase III trials are currently recruiting to assess this approach. However, outstanding issues include defining optimal treatment combinations which balance high efficacy with acceptable toxicity, validating biomarkers to aid in patient selection, and avoiding potential pitfalls such as missing a window for successful surgery, that is, choosing the right drugs, for the right patient, at the right time. Predictive biomarkers to direct selection of therapy are required, and the validation of major pathological response (MPR) as a surrogate for survival will be important in the uptake of the neoadjuvant approach. © 2021 BMJ Publishing Group.

Areas covered: We reviewed clinical data supporting the use of durvalumab as a monotherapy and combination therapy for the treatment of locally advanced and advanced NSCLC. Expert commentary: Durvalumab as a monotherapy or combination therapy has shown well-tolerated safety profiles for NSCLC in several trials. Durvalumab monotherapy in advanced NSCLC patients with PD-L1 ≥ 25% as later line (ATLANTIC study) therapy led to clinically meaningful improvements compared to standard of care. Combination therapy comprising durvalumab plus tremelimumab for advanced NSCLC did not show clinical efficacy in three phase III trials. Durvalumab administered after chemoradiotherapy in stage III NSCLC (PACIFIC study) significantly improved progression-free survival and overall survival. This result has led to approval of durvalumab for patients with locally advanced NSCLC as the standard of care.

With high rates of transmission and no curative therapies or vaccine yet available, the current cornerstone of management focuses on prevention by social distancing.

Patients with lung cancer are a particularly vulnerable population, where the risk of mortality from cancer must now be balanced by the potential risk of a life-threatening infection. In these unprecedented times, a collaborative and multidisciplinary approach is required to streamline but not compromise care. We have developed guidelines at our academic cancer center to standardize management of patients with lung cancer across our health care system and provide guidance to the larger oncology community. We recommend that general principles of lung cancer treatment continue to be followed in most cases where delays could result in rapid cancer progression. We recognize that our recommendations may change over time based on clinical resources and the evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, systemic chemotherapy is required for patients who are ineligible for radical radiation therapy. There is little evidence to date for the safety and efficacy of CRT administered after treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). The cases reported here had inoperable stage III lung cancer (non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer) and were ineligible for radical radiation therapy. They were administered ICIs plus chemotherapy and subsequently underwent late concurrent CRT. Because of the remarkable tumor shrinkage achieved by the ICIs plus chemotherapy, adverse events of CRT were tolerable. They were alive without tumor progression as of this report, over 1 year after CRT was terminated. CRT is administered with curative intent, while the intent of immunochemotherapy is palliative. Late concurrent CRT after immunochemotherapy is probably effective and tolerable. After treatment with systemic chemotherapy in patients judged ineligible for radical radiation therapy, radiation therapy should be reconsidered because of its importance once tumor shrinkage has been achieved. © 2021 The Authors.

	abstract = {Introduction: The standard-of-care therapy for extensive-stage SCLC has recently changed with the results of two large randomized trials revealing improved survival with the addition of immunotherapy to first-line platinum or etoposide chemotherapy. This has led to a lack of clarity around the role of consolidative thoracic radiation and prophylactic cranial irradiation in the setting of chemoimmunotherapy. Methods: The American Radium Society Appropriate Use Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guidelines include a review and analysis of current evidence with the application of consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of treatments recommended by the panel for extensive-stage SCLC. Results: Current evidence supports either prophylactic cranial irradiation or surveillance with magnetic resonance imaging every 3 months for patients without evidence of brain metastases. Patients with brain metastases should receive whole-brain radiation with a recommended dose of 30 Gy in 10 fractions. Consolidative thoracic radiation can be considered in selected cases with the recommended dose ranging from 30 to 54 Gy; this recommendation was driven by expert opinion owing to the limited strength of evidence, as clinical trials addressing this question remain ongoing. Conclusions: Radiation therapy remains an integral component in the treatment paradigm for ES-SCLC. © 2020},

	abstract = {Lung cancer is one of the main causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Over the years, different therapeutic modalities have been adopted depending on tumor stage and patient characteristics, such as surgery, radiotherapy (RT), and chemotherapy. Recently, with the development of immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), the treatment of metastatic and locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has experienced a revolution that has resulted in a significant improvement in overall survival with an enhanced toxicity profile. Despite this paradigm shift, most patients present some kind of resistance to ICI. In this setting, current research is shifting towards the integration of multiple therapies, with RT and ICI being one of the most promising based on the potential immunostimulatory synergy of this combination. This review gives an overview of the evolution and current state of the combination of RT and ICI and provides evidence-based data that can improve patient selection. The combination in lung cancer is a safe therapeutic approach that improves local control and progression-free survival, and it has the potential to unleash abscopal responses. Additionally, this treatment strategy seems to be able to re-sensitize select patients that have reached a state of resistance to ICI, further enabling the continuation of systemic therapy. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has revolutionised the treatment of solid tumours, yet most patients do not derive a clinical benefit. Resistance to ICB is often contingent on the tumour microenvironment (TME) and modulating aspects of this immunosuppressive milieu is a goal of combination treatment approaches. Radiation has been used for over a century in the management of cancer with more than half of all cancer patients receiving radiotherapy. Here, we outline the rationale behind combining radiotherapy with ICB, a potential synergy through mutually beneficial remodelling of the TME. We discuss the pleiotropic effects radiation has on the TME including immunogenic cell death, activation of cytosolic DNA sensors, remodelling the stroma and vasculature, and paradoxical infiltration of both anti-tumour and suppressive immune cell populations. These events depend on the radiation dose and fractionation and optimising these parameters will be key to develop safe and effective combination regimens. Finally, we highlight ongoing efforts that combine radiation, immunotherapy and inhibitors of DNA damage response, which can help achieve a favourable equilibrium between the immunogenic and tolerogenic effects of radiation on the immune microenvironment. © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {Cellular immunotherapy has recently emerged as a fourth pillar in cancer treatment co-joining surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Where, the discovery of immune checkpoint blockage or inhibition (ICB/ICI), anti‐PD‐1/PD‐L1 and anti‐CTLA4‐based, therapy has revolution-ized the class of cancer treatment at a different level. However, some cancer patients escape this immune surveillance mechanism and become resistant to ICB‐therapy. Therefore, a more advanced or an alternative treatment is required urgently. Despite the functional importance of epitran-scriptomics in diverse clinico‐biological practices, its role in improving the efficacy of ICB therapeutics has been limited. Consequently, our study encapsulates the evidence, as a possible strategy, to improve the efficacy of ICB‐therapy by co‐targeting molecular checkpoints especially N6A‐modifi-cation machineries which can be reformed into RNA modifying drugs (RMD). Here, we have ex-plained the mechanism of individual RNA‐modifiers (editor/writer, eraser/remover, and effec-tor/reader) in overcoming the issues associated with high‐dose antibody toxicities and drug‐re-sistance. Moreover, we have shed light on the importance of suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS/CISH) and microRNAs in improving the efficacy of ICB‐therapy, with brief insight on the current monoclonal antibodies undergoing clinical trials or already approved against several solid tumor and metastatic cancers. We anticipate our investigation will encourage researchers and clini-cians to further strengthen the efficacy of ICB‐therapeutics by considering the importance of epi-transcriptomics as a personalized medicine. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Purpose: Few studies have described real-world treatment patterns and survival before the widespread use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). We aimed to describe anti-cancer treatment including the use of programmed cell death-1 and ligand-1 (PD-1/PD-L1) ICIs and overall survival (OS) in advanced cancer patients as a benchmarking real-world standard before widespread use of ICIs. Patients and Methods: Using nationwide Danish medical registries, we assembled cohorts of Danish patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (n=12,283), urothelial carcinoma (n=2504), epithelial ovarian cancer (n=1466), gastric adenocarcinoma (n=1457), and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) (n=1261) diagnosed between 1/1/2013 and 31/12/2017. We describe anti-cancer treatment and OS using proportions, medians, and Kaplan–Meier methods. Results: Between 9% (ovarian cancer) and 25% (gastric adenocarcinoma) of patients did not receive anti-cancer treatment. The remaining patients received surgery, radiation therapy, and/or medical therapy. Chemotherapy was the most frequent medical therapy in all cohorts except for RCC (tyrosine kinase inhibitors). PD-L1/PD-1 ICIs were used in 7–8% of the NSCLC and RCC cohorts—mainly as second or higher line treatments. OS was longest in patients starting treatment with surgery (eg 25.6 months [95%-confidence interval (CI) =21.9–29.4] for NSCLC and 21.4 months [95%-CI=19.8–23.5] for urothelial carcinoma) and shortest for radiation therapy (eg 3.9 months [95%-CI=3.6–4.2] for NSCLC and 12.6 months [95%-CI=9.2–17.5] for urothelial carcinoma). NSCLC patients starting with medical therapy had OS between these limits. Median OS for NSCLC patients starting treatment with PD-L1/PD-1 ICIs was 21.4 months (95%-CI=13.9-not estimable). Conclusion: Most patients with advanced NSCLC, urothelial carcinoma, epithelial ovarian cancer, gastric adenocarcinoma and RCC had poor OS in an era where only a minority received PD-L1/PD-1 ICIs. This information on treatment patterns and survival is important as a benchmarking real-world standard before widespread use of ICIs. © 2021 Sørup et al.},

	abstract = {Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive malignancy. Until recently the standard of care for newly diagnosed patients with extensive-stage disease was chemotherapy consisting of etoposide plus a platinum (EP). The median overall survival (OS) was only about 10 months with this systemic therapy. Immune checkpoint inhibitors were first evaluated as second or subsequent line treatments in extensive stage disease and later in combination with EP in the first-line setting. Recently two randomized phase III trials have demonstrated statistically improved OS with addition of a programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) inhibitor to EP. As a result, the standard of care for newly diagnosed patients with extensive-stage SCLC has changed for the first time in decades. However, many patients do not derive benefit from the addition of a PD-L1 inhibitor to EP. In this review we discuss first-line trials of chemoimmunotherapy in extensive stage SCLC and summarize data on second and subsequent line treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors in immunotherapy-naïve patients. Additionally, we discuss potential biomarkers that could be utilized to select for which patients derive benefit from addition of a PD-L1 inhibitor to EP and propose ways to improve on first-line chemoimmunotherapy. © 2020 AME Publishing Company.

Radiation dose escalation failed to improve overall survival in RTOG 0617. However, conventionally fractionated radiation to 60 Gy with concomitant chemotherapy is associated with a high risk of local failure (38%–46%). It is hoped that concomitant immunotherapy during chemo/radiation can help decrease the risk of local failure, thereby improving overall survival and progression-free survival with acceptable toxicity. In this article, we review conventional chemo/radiation therapy for LA-NSCLC, as well as the quickly evolving world of immunotherapy in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer and discuss the rationale and study design of EA5181.

Despite the substantial optimism of treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, there is still a large proportion of patients with advanced NSCLC who are resistant to the inhibitors. Preclinical and clinical trials have demonstrated that radiotherapy can induce a systemic antitumor immune response and have a great potential to sensitize refractory "cold"tumors to immunotherapy. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), as a novel radiotherapy modality that delivers higher doses to smaller target lesions, has shown favorable antitumor effects with significantly improved local and distant control as well as better survival benefits in various solid tumors. Notably, research has revealed that SBRT is superior to conventional radiotherapy, possibly because of its more powerful immune activation effects. Thus, PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors combined with SBRT instead of conventional radiotherapy might be more promising to fight against NSCLC, further achieving more favorable survival outcomes. In this review, we focus on the underlying mechanisms and recent advances of SBRT combined with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors with an emphasis on some future challenges and directions that warrant further investigation. © 2020 The Author(s).},

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have heralded a new era for the treatment of advanced NSCLC with one-third of patients experiencing long-term survival. There is increasing interest in examining the role of ICI therapy in patients with early-stage NSCLC. Consolidation durvalumab after chemoradiation has become a part of standard of care for patients with inoperable, locally advanced disease. More recently, there is emerging evidence that neoadjuvant treatment with ICIs results in substantial rates of major pathologic response and pathologic complete response, and high rates of R0 resection with no significant delay in time to surgery. Furthermore, preliminary data show that adjuvant treatment with ICIs after adjuvant chemotherapy improves disease-free survival and may play a critical role in reducing disease recurrence in patients with resectable disease.

	abstract = {Systemic therapy for brain metastases (BM) is quickly moving from conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy toward targeted therapies, that allow a disruption of driver molecular pathways. The discovery of actionable driver mutations has led to the development of an impressive number of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), that target the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, anaplastic-lymphoma-kinase (ALK) rearrangements, and other rare molecular alterations in patients bearing metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the brain, with remarkable results in terms of intracranial disease control and overall survival. Moreover, these drugs may delay the use of local therapies, such as stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) or whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT). New drugs with higher molecular specificity and ability to cross the CNS barriers (BBB, BTB and blood-CSF) are being developed. Two major issues are related to targeted therapies. First, the emergence of a resistance is a common event, and a deeper understanding of molecular pathways that are involved is critical for the successful development of effective new targeted agents. Second, an early detection of tumor progression is of utmost importance to avoid the prolongation of an ineffective therapy while changing to another drug. In order to monitor over time the treatment to targeted therapies, liquid biopsy, that allows the detection in biofluids of either circulating tumor cells (CTCs) or circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) or exosomes, is increasingly employed in clinical trials: with respect to BM the monitoring of both blood and CSF is necessary. Also, radiomics is being developed to predict the mutational status of the BM on MRI. For patients without druggable mutations or who do not respond to targeted agents, immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors is increasingly employed, alone or in combination with radiotherapy. Pseudoprogression after immunotherapy alone maybe a challenge for several months after the start of treatment, and the same is true for radionecrosis after the combination of immunotherapy and SRS. In this regard, the value of advanced MRI techniques and PET imaging for a better distinction of pseudoprogression/radionecrosis and true tumor progression is promising, but needs validation in large prospective datasets. Last, a new frontier in the near future will be chemoprevention (primary and secondary), but we need to identify among solid tumors those subgroups of patients with a higher risk of relapsing into the brain and novel drugs, active on either neoplastic or normal cells of the microenvironment, that are cooperating in the invasion of brain tissue. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), one of the most fatal malignancies in the world, is usually diagnosed in advanced stages due to late symptom manifestation with very limited therapeutic options, which leads to ineffective intervention and dismal prognosis. For a decade, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have offered an overall survival (OS) benefit when used in a first-line (sorafenib and lenvatinib) and second-line setting (regorafenib and cabozantinib) in advanced HCC, while long-term response remains unsatisfactory due to the onset of primary or acquired resistance. Recently, immunotherapy has emerged as a promising therapy in the treatment of several solid tumors, such as melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer. Moreover, as the occurrence of HCC is associated with immune tolerance and immunosurveillance escape, there is a potent rationale for employing immunotherapy in HCC. However, immunotherapy monotherapy, mainly including immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) that target checkpoints programmed death-1 (PD-1), programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), and the cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4), has a relatively low response rate. Thus, the multi-ICIs or the combination of immunotherapy with other therapies, like antiangiogenic drugs and locoregional therapies, has become a novel strategy to treat HCC. Combining different ICIs may have a synergistical effect attributed to the complementary effects of the two immune checkpoint pathways (CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1 pathways). The incorporation of antiangiogenic drugs in ICIs can enhance antitumor immune responses via synergistically regulating the vasculature and the immune microenvironment of tumor. In addition, locoregional treatments can improve antitumor immunity by releasing the neoplasm antigens from killed tumor cells; in turn, this antitumor immune response can be intensified by immunotherapy. Therefore, the combination of locoregional treatments and immunotherapy may achieve greater efficacy through further synergistic effects for advanced HCC. This review aims to summarize the currently reported results and ongoing trials of the ICIs-based combination therapies for HCC to explore the rational combination strategies and further improve the survival of patients with HCC.

	abstract = {Approximately one third of patients with non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) present with stage III or locally advanced NSCLC. These patients have historically been managed with chemoradiotherapy. However, outcomes for these patients remain poor, with a 5-year survival rate between 15% and 32%. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized the treatment of patients with NSCLC. One such agent, durvalumab, a selective high-affinity human immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody that blocks programmed cell death ligand 1 binding to programmed cell death protein 1 and cluster of differentiation 80, was recently approved in the consolidation setting after completion of definitive platinum-based chemoradiotherapy and has become the current standard of care for patients with stage III locally advanced NSCLC. Immune checkpoint blockade is associated with increased risk of immunotherapy-related adverse events, which can be managed most effectively when detected early, ideally in the context of a multidisciplinary approach. Pneumonitis represents the potentially most severe and life-threatening of all reported immunotherapy-related adverse events, but it is further complicated in the context of recent prior therapies also known to cause pulmonary toxicity, such as radiotherapy. However, there are major gaps in our ability to identify immunotherapy-related pneumonitis and distinguish it from radiation pneumonitis. This review aims to define the key steps in the detection, diagnosis, and treatment of immunotherapy-related pneumonitis. © 2020 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Background: Accounting for 14% of lung cancer, small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly aggressive neuroendocrine malignancy with rapid proliferation, early spread, and poor survival. Aim and Methods: We provide an overview of recent advances regarding SCLC pathogenesis, subtypes, and treatment development through literature review of key trials. Results: There are no validated biomarkers or approved targeted treatments for this overly heterogeneous disease, but recent analyses have identified some promising targets and four major subtypes which may carry unique therapeutic vulnerabilities in SCLC. Treatment wise, only a third of patients present with limited stage SCLC, which can be managed with a combined modality approach with curative intent (usually chemo-radiotherapy, but in some eligible patients, surgery followed by systemic treatment). For advanced or extensive stage SCLC, combined chemotherapy (platinum–etoposide) and immunotherapy (atezolizumab or durvalumab during and after chemotherapy) has become the new standard front-line treatment, with modest improvement in overall survival. In the second-line setting, for disease relapse ≤ 6 months, topotecan, lurbinectedin, and clinical trials are reasonable treatment options; for disease relapse > 6 months, original regimen, topotecan or lurbinectedin can be considered. Moreover, Trilaciclib, a CD4/CD6 inhibitor, was recently FDA-approved to decrease the incidence of chemotherapy-related myelosuppression in SCLC patients. Conclusions: While modest improvements in survival have been made especially in the metastatic setting with chemo-immunotherapy, further research in understanding the biology of SCLC is warranted to develop biomarker-driven therapeutic strategies and combinational approaches for this aggressive disease. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {In the last few decades, cancer immunotherapy becomes an important tactic for cancer treatment. However, some immunotherapy shows certain limitations including poor therapeutic targeting and unwanted side effects that hinder its use in clinics. Recently, several researchers are exploring an alternative methodology to overcome the above limitations. One of the emerging tracks in this field area is nano-immunotherapy which has gone through rapid progress and revealed considerable potentials to solve limitations related to immunotherapy. Targeted and stimuli-sensitive biocompatible nanoparticles (NPs) can be synthesized to deliver immunotherapeutic agents in their native conformations to the site of interest to enhance their antitumor activity and to enhance the survival rate of cancer patients. In this review, we have discussed cancer immunotherapy and the application of NPs in cancer immunotherapy, as a carrier of immunotherapeutic agents and as a direct immunomodulator. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {Background: Serum tumor markers carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), cancer antigen 125 (CA125), cytokeratin 19 fragment (CYFRA21-1) and squamous-cell carcinoma-related antigen (SCC-Ag) are routinely used for monitoring the response to chemotherapy or targeted therapy in advanced-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), however their role in immunotherapy remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate whether dynamics of these serum markers were associated with the efficacy and prognosis of Chinese late-stage NSCLC patients treated with programmed cell death-1/programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-1/PD-L1) inhibitors. Methods: We initiated a longitudinal prospective study on advanced NSCLC patients treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in Chinese PLA general hospital (Beijing, China). Blood samples of baseline and after 6 weeks' treatment were collected. CT scan were used by all patients to evaluate treatment efficacy according to RECIST 1.1. Serum tumor markers levels were measured with an electrochemical luminescence for SCC-Ag and with a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay for serum CEA, CA125, and CYFRA21-1. At least 20% decreases of the biomarkers from baseline were considered as meaningful improvements after 6 weeks of treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Optimization-based method was used to balance baseline covariates between different groups. Associations between serum tumor biomarker improvements and objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were analyzed. Results: A total of 308 Chinese patients with advanced NSCLC were enrolled in the study. After balancing baseline covariates, patients with meaningful improvements in <2 out of 4 biomarkers (CEA, CA125, CYFRA21-1, and SCC-Ag) was ended up with lower ORR (0.08 vs. 0.35, p < 0.001), shorten PFS (median: 5.4 vs. 12.5 months, p < 0.001), and OS (median: 11.7 vs. 25.6 months, p < 0.001) in the total population. Subgroup analysis of patients with adenocarcinoma revealed that patients with meaningful improvements in <2 out of 4 biomarkers had significant lower ORR (0.06 vs. 0.36, p < 0.001), shorten PFS (median: 4.1 vs. 11.9 months, p < 0.001), and OS (median: 11.9 vs. 24.2 months, p < 0.001). So as in patients with squamous cell carcinoma, meaningful improvements in at least 2 out of 4 biomarkers were linked to better ORR (0.42 vs. 0.08, p = 0.014), longer PFS (median: 13.1 vs. 5.6 months, p = 0.001), and OS (median: 25.6 vs. 10.9 months, p = 0.06). Conclusions: The dynamic change of CEA, CA125, CYFRA21-1, and SCC-Ag from baseline have prognostic value for late-stage NSCLC patients treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Decrease of associated biomarkers serum levels were associated with favorable clinical outcomes. © Copyright © 2020 Zhang, Yuan, Chen, Li, Ma, Yan, Wang, Zhang, Tao, Guo, Huang, Zhang, Li, Zhi, Ge, Hu and Wang.},

	abstract = {Cancer patients are highly vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infections due to frequent contacts with the healthcare system, immunocompromised state from cancer or its therapies, supportive medications such as steroids and most importantly their advanced age and comorbidities. Patients with lung cancer have consistently been reported to suffer from an increased risk of death compared with other cancers. This is possibly due to the combination of specific pathophysiological aspects, including underlying pulmonary compromise due to smoking history and the increased specific pressures on respiratory healthcare services caused by the related pandemic. Rationally and safely treating patients with lung cancer during the pandemic has become a continuous challenge over the last year. Deciding whether to offer, modify, postpone or even cancel treatments for this particular patient's population has become the crucial recurrent dilemma for lung cancer professionals. Chemotherapy, immunotherapy and targeted agents represent distinct risks factors in the context of COVID-19 that should be balanced with the short-term and long-term consequences of delaying cancer care. Despite the rapid and persistent trend of the pandemic, declared by WHO on March 11, 2020, and still ongoing at the time of writing (January 2021), various efforts were made by oncologists worldwide to understand the impact of COVID-19 on patients with cancer. Adapted recommendations of our evidence-based practice guidelines have been developed for all stakeholders. Different small and large-scale registries, such as the COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium (CCC19) and Thoracic Cancers International COVID-19 Collaboration quickly collected data, supporting cancer care decisions under the challenging circumstance created by the COVID-19 pandemic. Several recommendations were developed as guidance for prioritizing the various aspects of lung cancer care in order to mitigate the adverse effects of the COVID-19 healthcare crisis, potentially reducing the morbidity and mortality of our patients from COVID-19 and from cancer. These recommendations helped inform decisions about treatment of established disease, continuation of clinical research and lung cancer screening. In this review, we summarize available evidence regarding the direct and indirect impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on lung cancer care and patients.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

	abstract = {Background: Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for 12-15% of lung cancers and is associated with poor survival outcomes and high symptom burden. This study employed a broad, systematic search strategy and timeframe to identify evidence on real-world treatment patterns and outcomes for SCLC outside the USA, including understanding sub-populations such as extensive-stage (ES) or limited-stage (LS) disease. Methods: Databases (MEDLINE, Embase, and EBM reviews) were searched for journal articles published in the English language between 1 January 2000-1 March 2020 and supplemented by hand searching of conference abstracts and posters presented at conferences between 1 January 2016-1 March 2020 reporting real-world treatment outcomes in patients with SCLC. A targeted clinical guideline review was also completed. Results: One-hundred studies provided quantitative data; 57 were available as full-text articles, whilst the remaining 43 were presented as abstracts or posters. The majority (80 studies, 80%) of included studies reported treatment in the first-line setting, where platinum-based chemotherapy and chemoradiotherapy was the most commonly used treatment strategy, in line with current treatment guidelines in SCLC. First-line treatments were found to have a high response rate; however, most patients relapsed early. No studies reported treatment or outcomes with immune-oncology therapies. Second-line treatment options were very limited, and primarily consisted of either re-treatment with first-line regimen or topotecan, but the prognosis for these patients remained poor. Outcomes were particularly poor amongst those with ES or relapsed disease vs. LS disease. Conclusions: SCLC treatment patterns and short survival outcomes have remained constant over the previous 20 years. Due to the search timeframe, none of the studies identified reported on the impact of recently approved immune-oncology therapies in SCLC. Further data is needed on the impact of immunotherapies on treatment patterns and real-world outcomes in SCLC. © Journal of Thoracic Disease. All rights reserved.},

The discovery of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for oncogene addicted NSCLC and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionised the therapeutic paradigm and improved survival of advanced NSCLC. The unprecedented impact of these drugs has shifted the focus of investigation to early stage disease aiming at improving cure. In this context, several single arm phase II studies evaluating neoadjuvant ICI alone or in combination with platinum-based Cht have shown encouraging rates of pathological response which have spurred several ongoing randomized trials with (neo)adjuvant ICI. More recently, ADAURA study evaluating adjuvant osimertinib demonstrated a profound reduction of the risk of recurrence in patients with stage I (>4 cm)-IIIA eNSCLC harbouring EGFR sensitizing mutations. ICIs and TKIs represent a true revolution in the treatment of eNSCLC call to challenge the current standard of care. However, questions regarding drug resistance, recurrence patterns, biomarker identification, optimal treatment duration and sequencing need be answered to effectively integrate new drugs in the rapidly evolving therapeutic landscape of NSCLC. In this review we critically review new developments and future perspectives of TKIs and ICI as (neo)adjuvant strategies for eNSCLC. © Translational Lung Cancer Research. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Immune checkpoints refer to a range of immunoregulatory molecules that modulate the immune response. For example, proteins expressed at the surface of T-cells (including PD-1 and CTLA-4) and their ligands (PD-L1 and B7-1/B7-2, respectively), expressed by cancer cells and anti-gen-presenting cells, are needed to prevent excessive immune responses. However, they dampen anti-tumor immunity by limiting T-cell activity, making them promising therapeutic targets in cancer. Although immunotherapies using checkpoint blocking/neutralizing antibodies targeting PD- L1 or PD-1 have proven their superiority over conventional chemotherapies or targeted therapies by enhancing T-cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity, some limitations have emerged. These include a relatively low rate of “responders” (<50%; irrespective of cancer type), the high cost of injections, and a rare risk of hyper-progression. For clinicians, the current challenge is thus to improve the existing therapies, potentially through combinatory approaches. Polyphenols such as resveratrol (RSV), a trihydroxystilbene found in various plants and an adjuvant in numerous nutraceuticals, have been proposed as potential therapeutic targets. Beyond its well-known pleiotropic effects, RSV affects PD-L1 and PD-1 expression as well as PD-L1 subcellular localization and post-translational modifications, which we review here. We also summarize the consequences of PD-1/PD-L1 signaling, the modalities of their blockade in the context of cancer, and the current status and limitations of these immunotherapies. Finally, we discuss their potential use in combination with chemotherapies, and, using RSV as a model, we propose polyphenols as adjuvants to enhance the efficacy of anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 immunotherapies. © 2021 by the authors.

In contrast to current traditional treatments such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy, anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 treatments can directly attenuate tumour-mediated exhaustion and effectively modulate the host anti-tumour immune response in vivo. In addition, compared with traditional therapy, PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor monotherapy can significantly prolong survival without obvious side effects in the treatment of advanced NSCLC. Ideally, several biomarkers could be used to monitor the safety and effectiveness of anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 treatments; however, the current lack of optimal prognostic markers remains a widespread limitation and challenge for further clinical applications, as does the possibility of immune-related adverse events and drug resistance.

	abstract = {Great advances in immune checkpoint blockade have resulted in a paradigm shift in patients with lung cancer. Immune-checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment, either as monotherapy or combination therapy, has been established as the standard of care for patients with locally advanced/metastatic non-small cell lung cancer without EGFR/ALK alterations or extensive-stage small cell lung cancer. An increasing number of clinical trials are also ongoing to further investigate the role of ICIs in patients with early-stage lung cancer as neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy. Although PD-L1 expression and tumor mutational burden have been widely studied for patient selection, both of these biomarkers are imperfect. Due to the complex cancer-immune interactions among tumor cells, the tumor microenvironment and host immunity, collaborative efforts are needed to establish a multidimensional immunogram to integrate complementary predictive biomarkers for personalized immunotherapy. Furthermore, as a result of the wide use of ICIs, managing acquired resistance to ICI treatment remains an inevitable challenge. A deeper understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms of acquired resistance to ICIs is helpful to overcome these obstacles. In this review, we describe the cutting-edge progress made in patients with lung cancer, the optimal duration of ICI treatment, ICIs in some special populations, the unique response patterns during ICI treatment, the emerging predictive biomarkers, and our understanding of primary and acquired resistance mechanisms to ICI treatment. © 2020, CSI and USTC.},

	abstract = {The superior efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer has inspired many clinical trials to use immune checkpoint inhibitors in earlier stages of lung cancer worldwide. Based on the theoretical feasibility that neoantigens derived from a tumor tissue are present in vivo, some clinical trials have recently evaluated the neoadjuvant, rather than the adjuvant, use of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Some of these trials have already produced evidence on the safety and efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors in a neoadjuvant setting, with a favorable major pathologic response and few adverse events. In the most impactful report from Johns Hopkins University and the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, the programed death-1 inhibitor nivolumab was administered to 21 patients in a neoadjuvant setting. The authors reported a major pathologic response rate of 45%, with no unexpected delay of surgery related to the adverse effects of nivolumab. The adjuvant as well as the neoadjuvant administration of immune checkpoint inhibitors has also been considered in various clinical trials, with or without the combined use of chemotherapy or radiotherapy. The development of appropriate biomarkers to predict the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors is also underway. The expression of programed death ligand-1 and the tumor mutation burden are promising biomarkers that have been evaluated in many settings. To establish an appropriate method for using immune checkpoint inhibitors in combination with surgery, the Lung Cancer Surgical Study Group of the Japan Clinical Oncology Group will manage clinical trials using a multimodality treatment, including immune checkpoint inhibitors and surgery. © The Author(s) 2020.

	abstract = {The treatment goal for patients with early-stage lung cancer is cure. Multidisciplinary discussions of surgical resectability and medical operability determine the modality of definitive local treatment (surgery or radiotherapy) and the associated systemic therapies to further improve the likelihood of cure. Trial evidence supports cisplatin-based adjuvant therapy either after surgical resection or concurrently with radiotherapy. Consensus guidelines support neoadjuvant chemotherapy in lieu of adjuvant chemotherapy and carboplatin-based regimens for patients who are ineligible for cisplatin. The incorporation of newer agents, now standard for patients with stage IV lung cancer, into the curative therapy paradigm has lagged owing to inefficient trial designs, the lengthy follow-up needed to assess survival end points and a developmental focus on the advanced-stage disease setting. Surrogate end points, such as pathological response, are being studied and might shorten trial durations. In 2018, the anti-PD-L1 antibody durvalumab was approved for patients with stage III lung cancer after concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Since then, the study of targeted therapies and immunotherapies in patients with early-stage lung cancer has rapidly expanded. In this Review, we present the current considerations in the treatment of patients with early-stage lung cancer and explore the current and future state of clinical research to develop systemic therapies for non-metastatic lung cancer. © 2021, Springer Nature Limited.},

	abstract = {Immunotherapy has radically changed the clinical management of patients with cancer in recent years. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) reversing the immunosuppressive effects of the tumor microenvironment are one type of immunotherapy, several of which are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as first-line treatments for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, response rates to ICIs are around 19-47% among patients with advanced NSCLC. As a result, the development of combined ICI and radiotherapy has begun with the aim of strengthening patients' antitumor immunity. Radiotherapy with substantial technological improvements not only achieves local tumor control through the induction of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage in irradiated regions, but also has the potential to mediate immunostimulatory effects that could result in tumor regression beyond irradiated regions. At present, numerous preclinical and clinical research are investigating the efficiency and safety of combining ICI with radiotherapy. The PACIFIC trial showed that combining chemoradiotherapy with ICI could improve clinical outcomes. In this review, we summarize the rationale for combining radiotherapy with immunotherapy. We also discuss the opportunities and challenges of combination therapy, including the timing of radiotherapy, optimal dose and fractionations, radiotherapy target and target volume, acquired resistance, patient selection, and radioimmunotherapy toxicity. © Translational Lung Cancer Research.

	abstract = {Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have revolutionized cancer treatment over the past decade. However, although the immune landscape suggests a strong rationale for the use of these agents in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, the available clinical evidence indicates that most patients currently do not respond to ICI monotherapy. Radiotherapy is a primary treatment modality for many patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer. While ionizing radiation traditionally has been thought to act in a purely cytotoxic fashion, a growing body of preclinical studies have demonstrated additional profound immunomodulatory effects. Consequently, there has been a surge of interest in the potential synergy between radiotherapy and immunotherapy, both the potential for radiotherapy to augment the systemic anti-tumor immune response and the potential for immunotherapy to improve in-field tumor response to radiation. In this review, we summarize the current preclinical and clinical evidence for radioimmunotherapy, with a particular focus on studies directly relevant to head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, as well as existing challenges and future directions for this emerging field. © Copyright © 2021 Qian and Schoenfeld.},

	abstract = {Immunotherapy has emerged as an unprecedented hope for the treatment of notoriously refractory cancers. Numerous investigational drugs and immunotherapy-including combination regimens are under preclinical and clinical investigation. However, only a small patient subpopulation across different types of cancer responds to the therapy due to the presence of several mechanisms of resistance. There have been extensive efforts to overcome this limitation and to expand the patient population that could be benefited by this state-of-the-art therapeutic modality. Among various causes of the resistance, we here focus on physical stromal barriers that impede the access of immunotherapeutic drug molecules and/or native and engineered immune cells to cancer tissues and cells. Two primary stromal barriers that contribute to the resistance include aberrant tumor vasculatures and excessive extracellular matrix build-ups that restrict extravasation and infiltration, respectively, of molecular and cellular immunotherapeutic agents into tumor tissues. Here, we review the features of these barriers that limit the efficacy of immunotherapy and discuss recent advances that could potentially help immunotherapy overcome the barriers and improve therapeutic outcomes.

	abstract = {Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) comprises a highly heterogeneous group of patients defined according to the extent and localization of disease. Patients with discrete N2 involvement identified preoperatively with resectable disease are candidates for multimodal therapy either with definitive chemoradiation therapy, induction chemotherapy, or chemoradiotherapy (CTRT) followed by surgery. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has yielded comparable survival benefit to adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with stage II–III disease and may allow for downstaging the tumor or the lymph nodes, an earlier delivery of systemic treatment, and better compliance to systemic therapy. The use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) as induction therapy shows encouraging activity and a favorable safety profile in patients with resectable early stage or locally advanced NSCLC. An unprecedented rate of pathological response and downstaging has been reported in single-arm clinical trials, especially when immunotherapy is combined with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Ongoing randomized phase II/III clinical trials assessing the efficacy and safety of induction with immunotherapy plus chemotherapy have the potential to establish this therapeutic approach as a novel standard of care. These trials aim to validate pathological response as a surrogate marker of survival benefit and to demonstrate that this therapeutic strategy can improve the cure rate in patients with stage II–III NSCLC. © Translational Lung Cancer Research.

	abstract = {Background: Treatment of oncogene-addicted non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has been changed by the advent of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Albeit great benefits are achieved with target therapies, resistance invariably occurs and recourse to alternative treatments is unavoidable. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) role and the best setting of immunotherapy administration in oncogene-driven NSCLC are matter of debate. Methods: We performed a systematic literature review through PubMed, in order to gather all the available information regarding ICI activity and efficacy in oncogene-addicted NSCLC, from both prospective trials and retrospective series. A meta-analysis of objective response rate in different molecular subgroups was provided. Combinatorial strategies including ICIs and related toxicities were also recorded. Results: Eighty-seven studies were included in the qualitative analysis. EGFR mutation may be a biomarker of poor response to single-agent ICIs (7% of EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients achieved disease response in prospective trials), while encouraging results have been shown with combination strategies. KRASmutated disease (response rate, RR, 22%) has different clinical and pathological characteristics, and the coexistence of additional mutations (e.g., STK11 or TP53) influence tumor microenvironment and response to immunotherapy. Other molecular alterations have been marginally considered prospectively, and data from clinical practice are variegated, given poor effectiveness of ICIs in ALK-rearranged disease (RR 9.5%, pooling the data of retrospective studies) or some encouraging results in BRAF-(RR 25%, retrospective data) or MET-driven one (with estimations conditioned by the presence of both exon 14 skipping mutations and gene amplification in reported series). Conclusions: In oncogene-addicted NSCLC (with the exception of KRAS-mutated), ICIs are usually administered at the failure of other treatment options, but administering single-agent immunotherapy in later disease phases may limit its efficacy. With the progressive administration of TKIs and ICIs in early-stage disease, molecular characterization will become fundamental in this setting. © 2021 AME Publishing Company. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and thoracic radiotherapy are increasingly used to treat advanced cancers. Despite data indicating exaggerated radiation toxicities in patients with autoimmune disease, the safety of thoracic radiotherapy in patients with prior ICI-associated immune-related adverse events (irAEs) is undefined. Patients and methods: Patients treated from 2014 to 2020 with ICIs were queried for receipt of corticosteroids and radiotherapy. Patients who received thoracic radiation after symptomatic irAEs were assessed for ≥grade 2 radiation pneumonitis (RP). Characteristics predictive of RP were assessed using logistic regression and response relationships were modeled. Results: Among 496 assessed patients, 41 with irAE history subsequently treated with thoracic radiotherapy were analyzed. Most irAEs were grade 2 (n = 21) and 3 (n = 19). Median time from irAE onset to radiotherapy was 8.1 months. Most patients received stereotactic body radiation therapy (n = 20) or hypofractionated radiotherapy (n = 18). In total, 25 patients (61%) developed ≥grade 2 RP at a median of 4 months from radiotherapy and 11 months from onset of irAEs. Three months from RP onset, 16 of 24 (67%) assessable patients had persistent symptoms. Among patients with prior ICI pneumonitis (n = 6), five patients (83%) developed ≥grade 2 RP (grade 2, n = 3; grade ≥3, n = 2). The mean lung radiation dose (MLD) predicted for RP (odds ratio: 1.60, P = 0.00002). The relationship between MLD and RP was strong (area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve: 0.85) and showed an exaggerated dose-response. Among patients with an MLD >5 Gy (n = 26), 21 patients (81%) developed ≥grade 2 RP. Conclusion: This is the first study assessing the toxicity of radiotherapy among patients with prior irAEs from ICIs. Patients with prior irAEs were found to be at very high risk for clinically significant and persistent RP from thoracic radiotherapy. Careful consideration should be given to the possibility of an increased risk of RP, and close monitoring is recommended in these patients. © 2020 European Society for Medical Oncology},

	abstract = {Advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has faced a therapeutic revolution with the advent of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and immune checkpoints inhibitors (ICIs) approved for first and subsequent therapies. CIMAvax-EGF is a chemical conjugate between human-recombinant EGF and P64, a recombinant protein from Neisseria meningitides, which induces neutralizing antibodies against EGF. In the last 15 years, it has been extensively evaluated in advanced NSCLC patients. CIMAvax-EGF is safe, even after extended use, and able to keep EGF serum concentration below detectable levels. In a randomized phase III study, CIMAvax-EGF increased median overall survival of advanced NSCLC patients with at least stable disease after front-line chemotherapy. Patients bearing squamous-cell or adenocarcinomas and serum EGF concentration above 870 pg/ml had better survival compared to control patients treated with best supportive care as maintenance, confirming tumors’ sensitivity to the EGF depletion. This manuscript reviews the state-of-the-art NSCLC therapy and proposes the most promising scenarios for evaluating CIMAvax-EGF, particularly in combination with TKIs or ICIs. We hypothesize that the optimal combination of CIMAvax-EGF with established therapies can further contribute to transform advanced cancer into a manageable chronic disease, compatible with years of good quality of life. © Copyright © 2021 Crombet Ramos, Santos Morales, Dy, León Monzón and Lage Dávila.},

Thus, the earlier MRD is detected, the earlier potentially beneficial treatment can be proposed to patients who might need it. Liquid biopsies, and in particular the next-generation sequencing of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in the blood, have been the focus of an increasing amount of research in the past years. The ctDNA detection at advanced cancer stages is practicable for several solid tumors, and complements molecular information on acquired therapy resistance. In the context of MRD, it is by definition more challenging to detect ctDNA, but it is technically achievable and provides information on treatment response and probability of relapse significantly earlier than standard imaging methods. The clinical benefit of implementing this new technique in the routine is being tested in interventional clinical trials at the moment. We propose here an update of the current use of ctDNA detection by NGS as a tool to assess the presence of MRD and improve adjuvant treatment of solid tumors. We also discuss the main limitations and medium-term perspectives of this process in the clinic. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {In the past 10 years, a deeper understanding of the immune landscape of cancers, including immune evasion processes, has allowed the development of a new class of agents. The reactivation of host antitumor immune response offers the potential for long-term survival benefit in a portion of patients with thoracic malignancies. The advent of programmed cell death protein 1/programmed death ligand-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), both as single agents and in combination with chemotherapy, and more recently, the combination of ICI, anti–programmed cell death protein 1, and anticytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 antibody, have led to breakthrough therapeutic advances for patients with advanced NSCLC, and to a lesser extent, patients with SCLC. Encouraging activity has recently emerged in pretreated patients with thymic carcinoma (TC). Conversely, in malignant pleural mesothelioma, pivotal positive signs of activity have not been fully confirmed in randomized trials. The additive effects of chemoradiation and immunotherapy suggested intriguing potential for therapeutic synergy with combination strategies. This has led to the introduction of ICI consolidation therapy in stage III NSCLC, creating a platform for future therapeutic developments in earlier-stage disease. Despite the definitive clinical benefit observed with ICI, primary and acquired resistance represent well-known biological phenomena, which may affect the therapeutic efficacy of these agents. The development of innovative strategies to overcome ICI resistance, standardization of new patterns of ICI progression, identification of predictive biomarkers of response, optimal treatment duration, and characterization of ICI efficacy in special populations, represent crucial issues to be adequately addressed, with the aim of improving the therapeutic benefit of ICI in patients with thoracic malignancies. In this article, an international panel of experts in the field of thoracic malignancies discussed these topics, evaluating currently available scientific evidence, with the final aim of providing clinical recommendations, which may guide oncologists in their current practice and elucidate future treatment strategies and research priorities. © 2020 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer},

	abstract = {Due to the limited effectiveness of immunotherapy used as first-line monotherapy in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the concepts of combining classical immunotherapy based on immune checkpoint antibodies with other treatment methods have been developed. Pembrolizumab and atezolizumab were registered in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of metastatic NSCLC, while durvalumab found its application in consolidation therapy after successful chemoradiotherapy in patients with locally advanced NSCLC. Exceptionally attractive, due to their relatively low toxicity and high effectiveness, are treatment approaches in which a combination of two different immunotherapy methods is applied. This method is based on observations from clinical trials in which nivolumab and ipilimumab were used as first-line therapy for advanced NSCLC. It turned out that the dual blockade of immune checkpoints activated T lymphocytes in different compartments of the immune response, at the same time affecting the downregulation of immune suppressor cells (regulatory T cells). These experiments not only resulted in the registration of combination therapy with nivolumab and ipilimumab, but also initiated other clinical trials using immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in combination with other ICIs or activators of costimulatory molecules found on immune cells. There are also studies in which ICIs are associated with molecules that modify the tumour environment. This paper describes the mechanism of the synergistic effect of a combination of different immunotherapy methods in NSCLC patients. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most frequent and aggressive primary central nervous system tumor. Surgery followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy with alkylating agents constitutes standard first-line treatment of GBM. Complete resection of the GBM tumors is generally not possible given its high invasive features. Although this combination therapy can prolong survival, the prognosis is still poor due to several factors including chemoresistance. In recent years, a comprehensive characterization of the GBM-associated molecular signature has been performed. This has allowed the possibility to introduce a more personalized therapeutic approach for GBM, in which novel targeted therapies, including those employing tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), could be employed. The GBM tumor microenvironment (TME) exerts a key role in GBM tumor progression, in particular by providing an immunosuppressive state with low numbers of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and other immune effector cell types that contributes to tumor proliferation and growth. The use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has been successfully introduced in numerous advanced cancers as well as promising results have been shown for the use of these antibodies in untreated brain metastases from melanoma and from non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Consequently, the use of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors has also been proposed in several clinical trials for the treatment of GBM. In the present review, we will outline the main GBM molecular and TME aspects providing also the grounds for novel targeted therapies and immunotherapies using ICIs for GBM. © Copyright © 2020 Di Cintio, Dal Bo, Baboci, De Mattia, Polano and Toffoli.},

	abstract = {Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death in the United States and around the world. Approximately 13% of lung cancers are small cell lung cancer (SCLC). SCLC is generally classified as a limited-stage and extensive-stage disease depending on the extent of involvement. For patients with the extensive-stage disease, until recently, chemotherapy alone has been the recommended treatment, although radiotherapy could be used in select patients for palliation of symptoms. The standard of care for extensive-stage SCLC is platinum doublet chemotherapy with either cisplatin or carboplatin in combination with etoposide. Even though first-line therapy has an initial response rate of 60-80%, the prognosis is poor, with overall survival of 10-12 months. The only FDA-approved second line of therapy is topotecan, approved both as an intravenous formulation as well as an oral formulation, with response rates of 6-12% in chemorefractory disease and 15-37% in chemosensitive disease. Immunotherapy has recently been approved as a first-line agent in metastatic SCLC in combination with chemotherapy. It is also approved as a third-line agent in metastatic SCLC after the failure of two chemotherapy regimens. The FDA approved four drugs, two of them being PD-1 inhibitors (pembrolizumab, nivolumab), and two of them being PD-L1 inhibitors (atezolizumab and durvalumab) in SCLC.

	abstract = {Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of the most common malignancies around the world. Due to the advanced stage of the disease at the time of diagnosis, most patients require systemic treatment. Immunotherapy with immune checkpoints inhibitors is becoming the main treatment method for many cancers, including NSCLC. Numerous studies have shown greater efficacy of immunotherapy used monoclonal antibodies anti-PD-1 (pembrolizumab and nivolumab) or anti-PD-L1 (atezolizumab and durvalumab) compared to chemotherapy. Unfortunately, cancer cells can develop a number of mechanisms to escape from immune surveillance, including avoid-ance of cancer cells by the immune system (immune desert), production of immunosuppressive compounds (prostaglandins, IDO, TGF-beta), or direct immune checkpoints interactions. Therapy based on the use of radiochemotherapy with subsequent immunotherapy is becoming the main focus of research in the field of new NSCLC therapies. Radiation therapy stimulates the immune response multidirectionally, affects production of neoantigens and proinflammatory compounds, which transform non-immunogenic (“cold”) tumors into highly immunogenic (“hot”) tumors. As a result, the mechanisms of escape of cancer cells from immune surveillance break down and the effectiveness of immunotherapy increases significantly. The results of clinical trials in this area bring new hope and indicate greater effectiveness of such treatment in terms of prolongation of progression-free survival and overall survival. © 2021 by the authors.

Recent Findings: The role of immunotherapy for NSCLC has expanded significantly following the pivotal approvals of nivolumab and pembrolizumab for metastatic NSCLC, maintenance durvalumab in unresectable stage III NSCLC, and atezolizumab for metastatic NSCLC. Several small early-phase trials have demonstrated the ability of RT to elicit clinically significant tumor immunity. These positive findings support current trial efforts combining RT with immunotherapy for NSCLC. Summary: Recently initiated trials of RT and immunotherapy hold significant promise in expanding the therapeutic options for NSCLC.

	abstract = {Stage III non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with N2 lymph node involvement is a heterogeneous group with different potential therapeutic approaches. Patients with potentially resectable III-N2 NSCLC are those who are considered to be able to receive a multimodality treatment that includes tumour resection after neoadjuvant therapy. Current treatment for these patients is based on neoadjuvant chemotherapy +/− radiotherapy followed by surgery and subsequent assessment for adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. In addition, some selected III-N2 patients could receive upfront surgery or pathologic N2 incidental involvement can be found a posteriori during analysis of the surgical specimen. The standard treatment for these patients is adjuvant chemotherapy and evaluation for complementary radiotherapy. Despite being a locally advanced stage, the cure rate for these patients continues to be low, with a broad improvement margin. The most immediate hope for improving survival data and curing these patients relies on integrating immunotherapy into perioperative treatment. Immunotherapy based on anti-PD1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors is already a standard treatment in stage III unresectable and advanced NSCLC. Data from the first phase II studies in monotherapy neoadjuvant therapy and, in particular, in combination with chemotherapy, are highly promising, with impressive improved and complete pathological response rates. Despite the lack of confirmatory data from phase III trials and longterm survival data, and in spite of various unresolved questions, immunotherapy will soon be incorporated into the armamentarium for treating stage III-N2 NSCLC. In this article, we review all therapeutic approaches to stage III-N2 NSCLC, analysing both completed and ongoing studies that evaluate the addition of immunotherapy with or without chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. © 2021 by the authors.

Areas covered: This review summarizes the clinical data emerging from randomized clinical studies with atezolizumab in NSCLC and small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), focusing in particular on the efficacy and safety data regarding the combinations of atezolizumab plus chemotherapy in the IMpower studies. Expert opinion: A significant improvement in progression-free survival and in overall survival was observed in IMpower 130 and 150 (NSCLC non-squamous) and 133 (SCLC), with an acceptable safety profile. In particular, the most common immune-related adverse events were rash (18–28% of patients), hypothyroidism (8–15%), hepatitis (5–17%), pneumonitis (2–7%), and colitis (1.5–2.3%). The safety profile of atezolizumab in combination with chemotherapy was consistent with the known adverse events related to single-agent atezolizumab and no new adverse events were observed.

	abstract = {Background and aim: Trial designs using multiple primary endpoints (MPEs) are increasing in phase III cancer trials. Our objectives were to describe the incidence of MPEs in recently published phase III trials testing systemic treatments in patients with advanced cancer; the main characteristics of trials adopting MPEs; the presence of mature results for all endpoints in the primary publication; consistency between results of each endpoint and authors’ conclusions. Methods: Articles of randomised phase III trials conducted in patients with advanced cancer, published between 2017 and 2020, were retrieved from PubMed. The main outcome was the proportion of trials with MPEs. In principle, according to regulatory agencies, we considered two distinct cases: (i) MPEs correspond to ‘multiple chances’ for the success of experimental treatment, needing adjustment for multiplicity, and (ii) a positive result depends on the success in all MPEs (‘co-primary’ endpoints). Results: Out of 235 eligible trials, 27 trials (12%) adopted MPE, mostly overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). The proportion of trials with MPEs increased over time, from 6% in 2017 to 20% in 2020 (p = 0.025). MPEs were adopted in 16% of for-profit trials versus 4% of non-profit trials (p = 0.006). The proportion of trials adopting MPEs was particularly high with immunotherapy (53%, p < 0.00001). Out of 27 trials with MPEs, 10 (37%) adopted an explicit definition of ‘co-primary’ endpoints, but only 1/10 declared the positivity of both endpoints critical for interpretation. Most trials (23, 85%) planned correction for multiplicity. Of 21 publications with positive conclusions, only 12 had a statistically significant positive result in both primary endpoints. In four cases (15%), positive conclusions were based on PFS results alone. Conclusions: Adoption of MPEs in randomised trials in oncology is quite common. Only a minority of trials respect recommendations by regulatory agencies about the adoption of MPEs, definition of ‘co-primary’ endpoints and correction for multiplicity. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive tumor type with limited therapeutic options and poor prognosis. Chemotherapy regimens containing platinum represent the cornerstone of treatment for patients with extensive disease, but there has been no real progress for 30 years. The evidence that SCLC is characterized by a high mutational burden led to the development of immune-checkpoint inhibitors as single agents or in combination with chemotherapy. Randomized phase III trials demonstrated that the combination of atezolizumab (IMpower-133) or durvalumab (CASPIAN) with platinum-etoposide chemotherapy improved overall survival of patients with extensive disease. Instead, the KEYNOTE-604 study demonstrated that the addition of pembrolizumab to chemotherapy failed to significantly improve overall survival, but it prolonged progression-free survival. The safety profile of these combinations was similar with the known safety profiles of all single agents and no new adverse events were observed. Nivolumab and pembrolizumab single agents showed anti-tumor activity and acceptable safety profile in Checkmate 032 and KEYNOTE 028/158 trials, respectively, in patients with SCLC after platinum-based therapy and at least one prior line of therapy. Future challenges are the identification predictive biomarkers of response to immunotherapy in SCLC and the definition of the role of immunotherapy in patients with limited stage SCLC, in combination with radiotherapy or with other biological agents. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {Lung cancer mortality has decreased over the past decade and can be partly attributed to advances in targeted therapy and immunotherapy. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have rapidly evolved from investigational drugs to standard of care for the treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In particular, antibodies that block inhibitory immune checkpoints, such as programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1), have revolutionized the treatment of advanced NSCLC, when administered alone or in combination with chemotherapy. Immunotherapy is associated with higher response rates, improved overall survival (OS), and increased tolerability compared with conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy. These benefits may increase the utility of immunotherapy and its combinational use with chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant treatment of patients with NSCLC. Early findings from various ongoing clinical trials suggest that neoadjuvant ICIs alone or combined with chemotherapy may significantly reduce systemic recurrence and improve long-term OS or cure rates in resectable NSCLC. Here we further summarize the safety and efficacy of various neoadjuvant treatment regimens including immunotherapy from ongoing clinical trials and elaborate the role of neoadjuvant immunotherapy in patients with resectable NSCLC. In addition, we discuss several unresolved challenges, including the evaluations to assess neoadjuvant immunotherapy response, the role of adjuvant treatment after neoadjuvant immunotherapy, the efficacy of treatment for oncogenic-addicted tumors, and predictive biomarkers. We also provide our perspective on ways to overcome current obstacles and establish neoadjuvant immunotherapy as a standard of care. © 2021 The Authors.

The management of SCLC significantly changed for the first time in decades with the introduction of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Pembrolizumab, a humanized IgG4 isotype antibody, targets the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) pathway to restore anti-tumor immunity. Prospective trials of pembrolizumab in patients with previously treated SCLC showed significant durability of responses. These results led to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granting pembrolizumab accelerated approval as second- or third-line monotherapy for patients with extensive-stage (ES) SCLC. In a recent clinical trial that included patients with previously untreated ES-SCLC, pembrolizumab in combination with platinum/etoposide met its progression-free survival endpoint, but overall survival (OS) did not cross the threshold for superiority. With the therapeutic landscape for SCLC rapidly evolving, we review prior experience and future directions of pembrolizumab in ES-SCLC. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Glioblastoma is the most lethal intracranial primary malignancy by no optimal treatment option. Cancer immunotherapy has achieved remarkable survival benefits against various advanced tumors, such as melanoma and non-small-cell lung cancer, thus triggering great interest as a new therapeutic strategy for glioblastoma. Moreover, the central nervous system has been rediscovered recently as a region for active immunosurveillance. There are vibrant investigations for successful glioblastoma immunotherapy despite the fact that initial clinical trial results are somewhat disappointing with unique challenges including T-cell dysfunction in the patients. This review will explore the potential of current immunotherapy modalities for glioblastoma treatment, especially focusing on major immune checkpoint inhibitors and the future strategies with novel targets and combo therapies. Immune-related adverse events and clinical challenges in glioblastoma immunotherapy are also summarized. Glioblastoma provides persistent difficulties for immunotherapy with a complex state of patients’ immune dysfunction and a variety of constraints in drug delivery to the central nervous system. However, rational design of combinational regimens and new focuses on myeloid cells and novel targets to circumvent current limitations hold promise to advent truly viable immunotherapy for glioblastoma. © 2020 by the authors.

For up to a quarter of patients with advanced NSCLC, CPIs have the potential to induce durable responses with long-term survival outcomes. Since the approval of first-line pembrolizumab for patients whose tumors express a PD-L1 ≥ 50%, several pivotal first-line CPI-based phase 3 studies have been conducted investigating combination treatments combining CPIs with chemotherapy (ChT) or combining different CPIs with or without ChT. As a result, there has been an increase in front-line treatment options for advanced NSCLC, and treatment algorithms are changing very quickly. In fit patients with advanced NSCLC, combination treatments including CPI and ChT are considered the new standard of care with improved clinical outcomes. CPI combination treatments are well tolerated and quality of life also seems to be better when CPIs are implemented in the first-line setting. The aim of this review is to provide a summary of the recently published first-line phase 3 studies investigating CPIs as monotherapy or in combination with other CPIs or ChT in advanced NSCLC, and to suggest possible treatment algorithms. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for about 85% of all lung cancers. The expected 5-year survival of stage III NSCLC ranges from 13% to 36% for stage III. Due to the heterogeneity and poor efficacy of stage III patients, there is great controversy on how to optimize the therapy strategy. Immunotherapy is providing better clinical efficacy to more NSCLC patients, and is rapidly extending its range of care from advanced stage to locally advanced stage and early stage NSCLC. Due to the patient's strong treatment intention, drug availability, and a few encouraging results from clinical trials (NADIM, NCT02716038, etc.), the authors observed a case of stage III NSCLC that achieved complete remission after receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy. In view of such a satisfactory result in neoadjuvant therapy, this article discusses how comprehensive treatment for stage III NSCLC patients may be conducted and the manner in which various therapeutic techniques can be mastered in the era of immunotherapy. Immunotherapy has opened the exploratory space for finding resolutions to numerous challenges of treating stage III NSCLC. Further clinical studies and exploration of personalized treatment, guided by imaging data, and clinical and pathological biomarkers are imperative for the benefit of these patients. © Translational Lung Cancer Research.

	abstract = {Tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells have been shown to play a crucial role in controlling tumor progression. However, the recruitment and activation of these immune cells at the tumor site are strictly dependent on several factors, including the presence of dendritic cells (DCs), the main orchestrators of the antitumor immune responses. Among the various DC subsets, the role of cDC1s has been demonstrated in several preclinical experimental mouse models. In addition, the high density of tumor-infiltrating cDC1s has been associated with improved survival in many cancer patients. The ability of cDC1s to modulate antitumor activity depends on their interaction with other immune populations, such as NK cells. This evidence has led to the development of new strategies aimed at increasing the abundance and activity of cDC1s in tumors, thus providing attractive new avenues to enhance antitumor immunity for both established and novel anticancer immunotherapies. In this review, we provide an overview of the various subsets of DCs, focusing in particular on the role of cDC1s, their ability to interact with other intratumoral immune cells, and their prognostic significance on solid tumors. Finally, we outline key therapeutic strategies that promote the immunogenic functions of DCs in cancer immunotherapy. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

However, since the success of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in melanoma, PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 immune checkpoint pathways have been established as effective therapies to manage advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and extensive-stage (ES) small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Multiple large-scale randomized clinical trials have analyzed the effects of ICIs in NSCLC, and results of these trials have since translated to the approval of single-agent PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, and the combination of PD-1 inhibitors with platinum-based chemotherapy has become the new standard of care for patients with advanced NSCLC. Furthermore, in ES SCLC, in which chemotherapy or chemoradiation has been the standard of care for decades, 2 anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agents have been approved for use in the frontline setting for ES SCLC, in combination with chemotherapy.

	abstract = {Background: Durvalumab was approved by the FDA in February 2018 for patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC that has not progressed after platinum-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy (cCRT), and this regimen is the current standard of care. The objective of this study was to examine the cost-effectiveness of durvalumab following cCRT versus cCRT alone in patients with locally advanced, unresectable stage III NSCLC. Methods: A 3-state semi-Markov model was used. Modeling was performed in a US healthcare setting from Medicare and commercial payer perspectives over a 30-year time horizon. Clinical efficacy (progression-free and post progression survival) and utility inputs were based on PACIFIC study data (ClinicalTrials. gov identifier: NCT02125461; data cutoff March 22, 2018). Overall survival extrapolation was validated using overall survival data from a later data cutoff (January 31, 2019). The main outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of durvalumab following cCRT versus cCRT alone, calculated as the difference in total costs between treatment strategies per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Results: In the base-case analysis, durvalumab following cCRT was cost-effective versus cCRT alone from Medicare and commercial insurance perspectives, with ICERs of $55,285 and $61,111, respectively, per QALY gained. Durvalumab was thus considered cost-effective at the $100,000 willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold. Sensitivity analyses revealed the model was particularly affected by variables associated with subsequent treatment, although no tested variable increased the ICER above the WTP threshold. Scenario analyses showed the model was most sensitive to assumptions regarding time horizon, treatment effect duration, choice of fitted progression-free survival curve, subsequent immunotherapy treatment duration, and use of a partitioned survival model structure. Conclusions: In a US healthcare setting, durvalumab was costeffective compared with cCRT alone, further supporting the adoption of durvalumab following cCRT as the new standard of care in patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC. © 2021 Harborside Press.

	abstract = {Squamous cell carcinoma of oral cavity (OCSCC) accounts for approximately 25% of cases of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Tobacco and alcohol consumption are the main risk factors for both cancers. Surgical resection, combined with adjuvant radiotherapy or radiochemotherapy in patients with high risk of relapse, is the key element in management in the initial stages. However, despite the availability of aggressive multidisciplinary treatments, advanced resectable OCSCC carries poor prognosis; only half of the patients are disease-free 5 years after the surgery. Immunotherapy based on the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors has been proven to be effective in a wide variety of tumours, including recurrent and metastatic HNSCC. These positive results resulted in investigations into its effectiveness in earlier stages of the disease with OCSCC emerging as an interesting research model because of the accessible location of the tumours. This article reviews the potential advantages of emerging immunotherapeutic agents [mainly monoclonal antibodies against programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitors] as neoadjuvant treatment for OCSCC at locoregional stages as well as the ongoing clinical trials, challenges in evaluating tumour response, and possible predictive biomarkers of response with highlights regarding the role of oral microbiota as modulators of immune response. The efficacy and safety of anti-PD-1 drugs in these patients have been proven in preliminary trials. If there is a decrease in the relapse rate and an improvement in the overall survival after surgical resection in ongoing trials, preoperative immunotherapy may be established as a treatment option for patients with early stages of the disease. © The Author(s), 2021.},

	abstract = {Background: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) represents approximately 15% of lung cancers, and approximately 70% are diagnosed as extensive-stage SCLC (ES-SCLC). Although ES-SCLC is highly responsive to chemotherapy, patients typically progress rapidly, and there is an urgent need for new therapies. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have recently been investigated in SCLC, and this review provides guidance on the use of these agents in ES-SCLC based on phase III evidence. Methods: Published and presented literature on phase III data addressing use of ICIs in ES-SCLC was identified using the key search terms “small cell lung cancer” AND “checkpoint inhibitors” (OR respective aliases). Directed searches of eligible studies were periodically performed to ensure capture of the most recent data. Results: Six phase III trials were identified, with four assessing the benefits of ICIs plus chemotherapy first-line, one evaluating ICIs as first-line therapy maintenance, and one assessing ICI monotherapy after progression on platinum-based chemotherapy. The addition of ipilimumab or tremelimumab to first-line treatment or as first-line maintenance did not improve survival. Two out of three studies combining PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors with first-line platinum-based chemotherapy demonstrated significant long-lasting survival benefits and improved quality of life with no unexpected safety concerns. PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors as first-line maintenance or in later lines of therapy did not improve survival. Biomarker research is ongoing as well as research into the role of ICIs in combination with radiation therapy in limited-stage SCLC. Conclusion: The addition of atezolizumab or durvalumab to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy for ES-SCLC prolongs survival and improves quality of life. Implications for Practice: Platinum-based chemotherapy has been standard of care for extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) for more than a decade. Six recent phase III trials investigating immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have clarified the role of these agents in this setting. Although ICIs were assessed first-line, as first-line maintenance, and in later lines of therapy, the additions of atezolizumab or durvalumab to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy were the only interventions that significantly improved overall survival and increased quality of life. These combinations should therefore be considered standard therapy for first-line ES-SCLC. Biomarker research and investigations into the role of ICIs for limited-stage disease are ongoing. © AlphaMed Press 2020},

There remains a pressing need for the development of innovative approaches to detect and intercept lung cancer at its earliest stage of development. Recent advances in genomics, computational biology, and innovative technologies offer unique opportunities to identify the immune landscape in the tumor microenvironment associated with early-stage lung carcinogenesis, and provide further insight in the mechanism of lung cancer evolution. This review will highlight the concept of immunoediting and focus on recent studies assessing immune changes and biomarkers in pulmonary premalignancy and early-stage non-small cell lung cancer. A protumor immune response hallmarked by an increase in checkpoint inhibition and inhibitory immune cells and a simultaneous reduction in antitumor immune response have been correlated with tumor progression. The potential systemic biomarkers associated with early lung cancer will be highlighted along with current clinical efforts for lung cancer interception. Research focusing on the development of novel strategies for cancer interception prior to the progression to advanced stages will potentially lead to a paradigm shift in the treatment of lung cancer and have a major impact on clinical outcomes. © 2020 American Association for Cancer Research.},

	abstract = {Background: Immune checkpoint inhibitors have become a valuable tool in the therapeutic strategy against metastasized non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) as they represent an effective and safe treatment option for many patients; however, the treatment response and side effects of this class of drugs can considerably differ compared to classical chemotherapeutics. The aim of this study was to highlight specific radiological pulmonary findings of NSCLC patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Methods and results: Medical records and images of prospectively collected data from 70 patients with advanced NSCLC, treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors, were reviewed. Of the patients two experienced an initial increase in tumor size, followed by a decrease in tumor size that was described as pseudoprogression. Another patient developed a sarcoid-like reaction accompanied by clinical improvements and radiological treatment response. A further two patients developed immune checkpoint-associated pulmonary injury that was clinically and radiologically classified as pneumonitis, which responded well to anti-inflammatory treatment. Conclusion: Management of patients with NSCLC using immune checkpoint inhibitors requires a knowledge of specific clinical and radiological findings. Both oncologists and radiologists have to be aware of the most common types, including atypical response patterns, such as a sarcoid-like reaction and pseudoprogression as well as of the pulmonary side effects that can encompass pneumonitis. © 2020, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The treatment landscape of locally advanced HPV-oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) is undergoing transformation. This is because the high cures rates observed in OPSCC are paired with severe treatment-related, long-term toxicities. These significant adverse effects have led some to conclude that the current standard of care is over-treating patients, and that de-intensifying the regimens may achieve comparable survival outcomes with lower toxicities. Consequently, several de-escalation approaches involving locally advanced OPSCC are underway. These include the reduction of dosage and volume of intensive cytotoxic regimens, as well as elimination of invasive surgical procedures. Such de-intensifying treatments have the potential to achieve efficacy and concurrently alleviate morbidity. Targeted therapies, given their overall safer toxicity profiles, also make excellent candidates for de-escalation, either alone or alongside standard treatments. However, their role in these endeavors is currently limited, because few targeted therapies are currently in clinical use for head and neck cancers. Unfortunately, cetuximab, the only FDA-approved targeted therapy, has shown inferior outcomes when paired with radiation as compared to cisplatin, the standard radio-sensitizer, in recent de-escalation trials. These findings indicate the need for a better understanding of OPSCC biology in the design of rational therapeutic strategies and the development of novel, OPSCC-targeted therapies that are safe and can improve the therapeutic index of standard therapies. In this review, we summarize ongoing research on mechanism-based inhibitors in OPSCC, beginning with the salient molecular features that modulate tumorigenic processes and response, then exploring pharmacological inhibition and pre-clinical validation studies of candidate targeted agents, and finally, summarizing the progression of those candidates in the clinic. © Copyright © 2021 Chitsike and Duerksen-Hughes.},

	abstract = {Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for 13–15% of all new lung cancer cases in the US. The tumor has a tendency to disseminate early resulting in 80–85% of patients being diagnosed with extensive disease (ES-SCLC). Chemotherapy has provided SCLC patients considerable survival benefits over the past three decades. Nonetheless, most patients relapse and rarely survive beyond 2 years. Despite consistent overall response rates of ≥50%, until recently, median survival times and 2-year survivals only ranged between 7–10 months and 10–20%, respectively. Several chemotherapy agents possess activity against SCLC, both, as single agents and in combinations but etoposide-platinum emerged as the preferred first line regimen. Upon relapse, many patients remain candidates for additional therapy. However, the sensitivity of relapsed SCLC to further therapies is markedly reduced and dependent upon the level and duration of response to the initial treatment (platinum-sensitive vs. resistant relapse). Multiple factors suggest a therapeutic role for immunotherapy in SCLC: SCLC has been associated with immune-mediated paraneoplastic processes (cerebellar degeneration, limbic encephalitis, and Lambert–Eaton syndrome) and patients presenting with these paraneoplastic syndromes have shown more favorable outcomes, suggesting an underlying immune response mechanism. Comprehensive genomic profiling of SCLC indicates that the majority lack functional p53 (90%) and Rb1 (65%). These universal genetic aberrations facilitate poor genomic stability, thus perpetuating the generation of tumor associated antigens, amenable to targeting with immunotherapy. SCLC has one of the highest mutational loads, likely a reflection of the myriad of insults inflicted by smoking-related carcinogens. The relationship between tumor mutational load and response to immune checkpoint inhibitors has been established in multiple solid tumors, including preliminary results in relapsed SCLC. In this manuscript, we review the early (some failed and discontinued, some partly successful, and still ongoing) attempts to incorporate immunotherapy (particularly vaccine based approaches) to the treatment of SCLC, and the latest attempts (mostly incorporating the use of checkpoint inhibitors), including those with favorable but preliminary results (CheckMate 032, Keynote 028 and 158), and those with more definitive positive (iMpower 133 and CASPIAN) and negative (CheckMate 331 and 451) results. © Copyright © 2020 Saltos, Shafique and Chiappori.},

	abstract = {Advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) is a heterogeneous disease, characterized by several subtypes with distinctive genetic and epigenetic patterns. During the last years, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revamped the standard of care of several tumors such as non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma, highlighting the role of immune cells in tumor microenvironment (TME) and their impact on cancer progression and treatment efficacy. An “immunoscore,” based on the percentage of two lymphocyte populations both at tumor core and invasive margin, has been shown to improve prediction of treatment outcome when added to UICC-TNM classification. To date, pembrolizumab, an anti-programmed death protein 1 (PD1) inhibitor, has gained approval as first-line therapy for mismatch-repair-deficient (dMMR) and microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) advanced CRC. On the other hand, no reports of efficacy have been presented in mismatch-repair-proficient (pMMR) and microsatellite instability-low (MSI-L) or microsatellite stable (MSS) CRC. This group includes roughly 95% of all advanced CRC, and standard chemotherapy, in addition to anti-EGFR or anti-angiogenesis drugs, still represents first treatment choice. Hopefully, deeper understanding of CRC immune landscape and of the impact of specific genetic and epigenetic alterations on tumor immunogenicity might lead to the development of new drug combination strategies to overcome ICIs resistance in pMMR CRC, thus paving the way for immunotherapy even in this subgroup. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Cervical cancer (CC) is most often caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). In principle, these ties to the virus should make HPV tumors a relatively easy target for clearance by the immune system. However, these HPV-associated tumors have evolved strategies to escape immune attack. Checkpoint inhibition immunotherapy, which has had remarkable success in cancer treatment, has the potential to overcome the immune escape in CC by harnessing the patient’s own immune system and priming it to recognize and kill tumors. Recent work involving PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in CC lends credence to this belief, as pembrolizumab has shown evidence of clinical efficacy and consequently been granted accelerated approval by the FDA. That being said, the oncologic outcomes following monotherapy with these biologics have mostly been modest and variable, and this can be attributed to alternative resistance mechanisms to tumor response. The use of therapies that stimulate immune responses via checkpoint-independent activation will therefore augment release of T cell inhibition by checkpoint inhibitors for stronger and more sustained clinical responses. Such a combinatorial approach holds promise for weak- or non-responders to checkpoint therapies as supported by evidence from various, recent pre-clinical, and preliminary clinical studies. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

Multiple large-scale randomized clinical trials have analyzed the effects of ICIs in NSCLC, and results of these trials have since translated to the approval of single-agent PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, and the combination of PD-1 inhibitors with platinum-based chemotherapy has become the new standard of care for patients with advanced NSCLC. Furthermore, in ES SCLC, in which chemotherapy or chemoradiation has been the standard of care for decades, 2 anti–PD-1/PD-L1 agents have been approved for use in the frontline setting for ES SCLC, in combination with chemotherapy.

	abstract = {Background: Venous (VTEs) and arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs) are causes of morbidity, disability, mortality, and increase in treatment costs in cancer patients. The risk associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has not yet been clarified. The primary objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the incidence of VTEs and ATEs in patients treated with ICIs as single agents or in combination with other treatments. Material and methods: Data from retrospective and prospective studies were selected from PubMed, EMBASE, SCOPUS, and The Cochrane Library from inception up to May up to 21st May 2020. All studies had to be in English and use human study participants. The studies were eligible if they provided a number (or rate) of VTEs and ATEs and the size of the population included. The PRISMA guidelines were followed. The data on the incidence of VTEs and ATEs were extracted for each arm, analyzed using random-effects models, and reported as weighted measures. Results: A total of 20,273 patients from 68 studies were included (median follow-up ranged from a few months up to three years). Overall, there were 390 VTEs and 59 ATEs, with incidence rates of 2.7% (95%CI 1.8%–4%) and 1.1% (95%CI 0.5%–2.1%), respectively. The rate of pulmonary embolism was 1.6% (95%CI 0.7%–3.2%) and deep venous thrombosis was 2.7% (95%CI 1.4%–5.4%). In studies where ICIs were administered with chemotherapy, rates of VTEs were similar to ICI alone arms (2.8% vs 2.5%). The rate of stroke and myocardial infarction were 1.1% (95%CI 0.65%–1.45%) and 0.7% (95%CI 0.15%–1.15%), respectively. In randomized trials, compared with non-ICIs containing arms (e.g. chemotherapy), the relative risk (RR) of VTEs due to ICIs was similar (RR 1.08, 95%CI 0.6–1.9; P =.79). Conclusions: Thromboembolic events associated with ICIs are relatively rare in cancer patients with an advanced stage of the disease. However, in randomized studies, their incidence is similar to control arms, suggesting that the contributory role of ICIs to the thromboembolic risk in many cancer settings is small. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Immunotherapy is a major breakthrough in the treatment of cancer in recent years. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) including programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)/programmed death-1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) have been used for different histologic types of cancer including primary lung cancer that represents the most common and fatal cancer globally. Among ICI immunotherapy agents, atezolizumab, durvalumab, ipilimumab, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab are currently used as standard-of-care (SOC) treatment for metastatic or earlier stages of lung cancer. Major issues of ICI immunotherapy in lung cancer comprise the use of immune biomarkers prior to ICI therapy, selection of ICI agents, combination of ICIs/chemotherapy, combination of ICIs/radiotherapy, sequence of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) targeted therapy and ICI immunotherapy, sequence of chemotherapy and ICI immunotherapy, treatment duration of ICI regimen and ICI therapy for different histopathology, stage, PD-L1, and performance status. Based on the contemporary major clinical trials and authoritative guidelines, the objective of this review is to present an overview of the current status of ICI immunotherapy in lung cancer. © Copyright © 2021 Xiong, Zhao, Du and Guo.},

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE This study demonstrates that tislelizumab in combination with chemotherapy is associated with improved progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with advanced squamous non-small-cell lung cancer (sq-NSCLC). OBJECTIVE To assess the efficacy and safety/tolerability of tislelizumab plus chemotherapy vs chemotherapy alone as first-line treatment for patients with advanced sq-NSCLC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This open-label, randomized phase 3 clinical trial was conducted at 46 sites in China between July 2018 and June 2019 and included patients with treatment-naive, histologically confirmed stage IIIB/IV sq-NSCLC. The data cutoff for these analyses was December 6, 2019; data extraction occurred on January 7, 2020. INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomized (1:1:1) to receive 1 of the following regimens intravenously on a 21-day cycle: tislelizumab (200 mg, day 1) plus paclitaxel (175 mg/m2, day 1) and carboplatin (area under the concentration of 5, day 1) (arm A); tislelizumab plus nab-paclitaxel (100 mg/m2, days 1, 8, and 15) and carboplatin (arm B); and paclitaxel and carboplatin (arm C). Patients were stratified by disease stage and tumor programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression (<1% vs 1%-49% vs >50%). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by an independent review committee (IRC). Secondary end points included overall survival, investigator-assessed (INV) PFS, IRC-assessed objective response rate (ORR), and IRC-assessed duration of response, as well as the incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs). RESULTS Overall, 355 patients (median [range] age, 62 [34-74] years; 330 men [91.7%]) with sq-NSCLC received treatment. After a median study follow-up of 8.6 months (95% CI, 8.1-9.0 months), IRC-assessed PFS was significantly improved with tislelizumab plus chemotherapy (arm A, 7.6 months; arm B, 7.6 months) vs chemotherapy alone (arm C, 5.5 months; hazard ratios were 0.524 (95% CI, 0.370-0.742; P <.001 [A vs C]) and 0.478 (95% CI, 0.336-0.679; P <.001 [B vs C]). Higher IRC-assessed ORR and longer IRC-assessed duration of response were observed in arms A (72.5%; 8.2 months) and B (74.8%; 8.6 months) vs C (49.6%; 4.2 months). No association was observed between PD-L1 expression and IRC-assessed PFS or ORR. Discontinuation of any treatment because of AEs was reported in 15 (12.5%; arm A), 35 (29.7%; arm B), and 18 (15.4%; arm C) patients. In each arm, the most common grade of 3 or greater AE was decreased neutrophil levels, which aligned with known chemotherapy toxic effects. Six treatment-related AEs leading to death occurred; however, no deaths were solely attributed to tislelizumab. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this phase 3 randomized clinical trial, adding tislelizumab to chemotherapy was associated with significantly prolonged IRC-assessed PFS, higher IRC-assessed ORRs, and a manageable safety/tolerability profile in patients with advanced sq-NSCLC, regardless of PD-L1 expression. © 2021 American Medical Association.},

	abstract = {Background Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) for treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have been rapidly evolving. ICIs are likely to be more effective but also lead to escalating healthcare costs. Objectives The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) for treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods We searched the PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library for studies comparing the cost effectiveness of ICIs for NSCLC. Potential studies identified were independently checked for eligibility by two authors, with disagreement resolved by a third reviewer. Quality of the included studies was evaluated using Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards checklists. Results A total of 22 economic studies were included. Overall reporting of the identified studies largely met CHEERS recommendations. In the first-line setting, for advanced or metastatic NSCLC patients with PD-L1 ≥ 50%, pembrolizumab appeared cost-effective compared with platinum-based chemotherapy in the US and Hong Kong (China), but not in the UK and China. The cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy for first-line treatment of NSCLC in PD-L1 ≥ 1% patients remained obscure. Regardless of PD-L1 expression status, pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy could be a cost-effective first-line therapy in the US. On the contrary, addition of atezolizumab to the combination of bevacizumab and chemotherapy was not cost-effective for patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC from the US payer perspective. In the second-line setting compared with docetaxel, pembrolizumab was cost-effective; though nivolumab was not cost-effective in the base case, it could be by increased PD-L1 threshold. Results of the cost-effectiveness of atezolizumab second-line treatment remained inconsistent. In addition, the adoption of durvalumab consolidation therapy after chemoradiotherapy could be cost-effective versus no consolidation therapy for patients with stage III NSCLC. Conclusions Immunotherapy can be a cost-effective option for treatment of NSCLC in several scenarios. A discount of the agents or the use of PD-L1 expression as a biomarker improves the cost-effectiveness of immunotherapy. © 2020 Ding et al.

	abstract = {Objective: The advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has rapidly transformed the treatment paradigm of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Despite the durability of response to ICIs, the vast majority of patients will later develop progression. However, the failure patterns of ICI treatment are unknown. Here, our study explored the failure patterns in advanced NSCLC patients treated with ICIs. Methods: A cohort of 156 IIIB or IV NSCLC patients treated with first-/second-line ICIs were retrospectively analyzed. Patients who experienced clinical benefit and then developed progression were identified. The disease progression patterns were divided into three categories: progression in new sites, progression in existing sites, and combined progression. The number of progression sites was also recorded. Results: Before the cutoff date, 91 (77.1%) patients had experienced disease progression; 34% of patients had progressed in the last 9 months of the first year. Fifty-three (58.2%) patients had developed progression at existing lesions, and 56 (61.5%) patients had shown ≤2 progression sites (oligo-progression). In patients with oligo-progression, the median time of disease progression was 8.23 months and the counterpart (systemic progression) was 5.97 months. The oligo-progression patients showed prolonged median overall survival (27.23 months) compared with patients with systemic progression (18.87 months). Conclusions: Failure patterns of ICI therapy were predominantly “existing” sites, and the most common lesions of progression were the lung and lymph nodes. Most patients experienced oligo-progression which occurred later than systemic progression and showed prolonged overall survival. The control of the local lesions might be beneficial to improve ICI treatment efficacy. © Copyright © 2021 Chai, Yin, Cai, Fu and Zhang.},

Whereas detailed researches regarding ICBs in the two major histological subtypes are rare. In order to uncover the clinical efficacy differences between squamous and adenocarcinoma NSCLC and better understand the underlying immune-regulatory mechanisms, we compared the survival benefits of ICBs between the two subtypes by revealing phase 3 randomized trials and attempted to uncover the immune-regulatory discrepancy. Generally, compared with nonsquamous NSCLC, squamous NSCLC benefited more from ICBs in Keynote 024, CheckMate 026, CheckMate 227 and CheckMate 017 and similar in OAK, but less in Keynote 010 and PACIFIC. We revealed that the tumor mutation burden (TMB) level, the programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in the tumor microenvironment (TME), chemokines, and oncogenic driver alterations within the two subtypes may contributed to the clinical outcomes of ICBs. We prospected that the combinations of ICBs with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and antiangiogenic therapy could be promising strategies to re-immunize the less immunogenic tumors and further enhance the efficacy of ICBs. © 2020 The Authors.

Methods: The protocol following PRISMA methodology was submitted as PROSPERO 154049. We included individually randomized trials comparing two or more chemotherapy regimens as the first-line treatment for chemo-naïve ED-SCLC regardless of the age, sex, performance status, co-morbidities, and organ functions written in the English language since 2000. Molecular targeted agents and immune checkpoint inhibitors were considered chemotherapy along with cytotoxic medications. We pooled the logarithm of hazard ratio (HR) and its standard error using the frequentist weighted least squares approach random-model network meta-analysis. Results: A total of 46 eligible trials that involved 11,987 patients were included. The primary endpoint, HR of overall survival (OS, HRos) of the selected comparisons was as follows: carboplatin+amrubicin (HRos 0.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.33–0.96), carboplatin+etoposide+atezolizumab (HRos 0.70, 95% CI 0.53–0.92), and carboplatin+irinotecan (HRos 0.73, 95% CI 0.58–0.91) were compared with carboplatin+etoposide. The carboplatin+etoposide+atezolizumab regimen was compared with carboplatin+irinotecan (HRos 0.97, 95% CI 0.68–1.37) and cisplatin+irinotecan regimen (HRos 0.87, 95% CI 0.58–1.31). “Selective carboplatin or cisplatin (CBDCA/CDDP)”+etoposide+durvalumab was compared with CBDCA/CDDP+etoposide (HRos 0.73, 95% CI 0.59–0.91). Platinum+etoposide+durvalumab was compared with platinum+irinotecan (HRos 0.88, 95% CI 0.67–1.15). Cumulative meta-analysis suggested that platinum+irinotecan was associated with better OS than platinum+etoposide as of 2010 through 40 out of 46 trials in our review that used platinum+etoposide as a reference regimen. Conclusion: Patients treated with carboplatin+amrubicin, carboplatin+etoposide+atezolizumab, CBDCA/CDDP+etoposide+durvalumab, and platinum+irinotecan showed better HRos than those treated with platinum+etoposide, one of the standard regimens. © The Author(s), 2020.},

	abstract = {Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) has been found to be a complex group of malignancies characterized by their profound immunosuppression and high aggressiveness. In most cases of advanced HNSCC, treatment fails to obtain total cancer cure. Efforts are needed to develop new therapeutic approaches to improve HNSCC outcomes. In this light, T-cells “immune checkpoint” has attracted much attention in cancer immunotherapy. It has been broadly accepted that inhibitory T-cell immune checkpoints contribute to tumor immune escape through negative immune regulatory signals (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 [CTLA-4], programmed cell death 1 [PD-1], B7-H3, and B7-H4, etc). Current data suggest that PD-1 and CTLA-4 receptors can inhibit T-cell receptors and T-cell proliferation. Blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 and/or CTLA-4/CD28 pathways has shown promising tumor outcomes in clinical trials for advanced solid tumors like melanoma, renal cell cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer. The present review attempts to explore what is known about PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4/CD28 pathways with a focus on HNSCC. We further discuss how these pathways can be manipulated with therapeutic intent. © 2017 Qi et al.},

	abstract = {Background: In the recent years, immunotherapeutics and specifically immune-checkpoints inhibitors have marked a significant shift in the diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), allowing us to use immunotherapeutics alone or combined with chemotherapy for a great subset of patients. However, new interesting approaches are being presently investigated, markedly immunotherapy combinations, that is, the use of two or more im-munotherapeutics combined. Methods: In particular, the combination of anti-PD-1 nivolumab and anti-CTLA-4 ipilimumab has already provided groundbreaking positive results in the advanced NSCLC and other combinations are currently under investigation. Results: Therefore, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive state-of-the-art review about immu-notherapy combination, along with suggestions about future directions. A comprehensive literature search was carried out to identify eligible studies from MEDLINE/PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov. Conclusion: Nivolumab plus ipilimumab represent the most promising immunotherapy combination for the treatment of advanced NSCLC patients; safety, tolerability and efficacy of new immu-notherapeutics (in monotherapy and in immunotherapy combinations) must be further assessed in future studies. © 2020 Bentham Science Publishers.},

	abstract = {Esophageal cancer remains a challenging disease due to limited treatment options and poor prognosis. In recent years, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have been proven to be safe and effective in the treatment of highly lethal malignancies, such as non‐small cell lung cancer and melanoma. Recent clinical trials also showed promising activity in immune checkpoint inhibitors in pretreated advanced esophageal carcinoma and a potentially significant impact on the outcome of selected patients, independently of histology. Combination studies evaluating immunotherapy and chemotherapy and, in localized disease, radiotherapy are in progress and will hopefully confirm their promises in the near future. However, reliable predictive biomarkers are still lacking. Indeed, at present, the role of programmed cell death ligand 1 expression and other factors (such as microsatellite instability and tumor mutational burden) as predictive biomarkers of benefit to immune checkpoint inhibitors is still controversial. Our aim was to explore the rationale of ICIs in esophageal cancer, review the results already available in multiple settings, and investigate future perspectives with single‐agent and combination strategies. © 2020 by the authors.

Methods This prospective study of 42 patients treated with a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor was approved by our institutional review board, and all patients gave written, informed consent. Tumor burden dynamics were assessed on 18F-FDG PET/CT before and after treatment initiation. Immunotherapeutic responses were evaluated according to RECIST 1.1, iRECIST, and PERCIST 1.0 for the dichotomous groups, responders versus nonresponders. Cohen κ and Wilcoxon signed rank tests were used to evaluate concordance among these criteria. We assessed progression-free survival and overall survival using the Kaplan-Meier estimator. Results The RECIST 1.1 and PERCIST 1.0 response classifications were discordant in 6 patients (14.2%; κ = 0.581). RECIST 1.1 and iRECIST were discordant in 2 patients, who evidenced pseudoprogression after treatment initiation. Median progression-free survival, as well as overall survival, was significantly longer for responders compared with nonresponders for all criteria (P < 0.001), with no significant difference between the 3 criteria (P > 0.05). Conclusions RECIST 1.1 and PERCIST 1.0 show only moderate agreement, but both can predict treatment response to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor therapy. In case of pseudoprogression, metabolic tumor activity may help to correctly classify treatment response. © 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.},

Durvalumab is under evaluation in early, locally advanced and advanced disease as monotherapy and combined with ICIs, targeted therapies, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Impressive activity has been recently reported after chemoradiation in locally advanced patients; promising activity was observed with other ICI combinations, and potentially with other drugs including platinum-based chemotherapy.

	abstract = {Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounting for over 85% of all cases. Until recently, chemotherapy - characterized by some benefit but only rare durable responses - was the only treatment option for patients with NSCLC whose tumors lacked targetable mutations. By contrast, immune checkpoint inhibitors have demonstrated distinctly durable responses and represent the advent of a new treatment approach for patients with NSCLC. Three immune checkpoint inhibitors, pembrolizumab, nivolumab and atezolizumab, are now approved for use in first- and/or second-line settings for selected patients with advanced NSCLC, with promising benefit also seen in patients with stage III NSCLC. Additionally, durvalumab following chemoradiation has been approved for use in patients with locally advanced disease. Due to the distinct features of cancer immunotherapy, and rapid progress in the field, clinical guidance is needed on the use of these agents, including appropriate patient selection, sequencing of therapies, response monitoring, adverse event management, and biomarker testing. The Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) convened an expert Task Force charged with developing consensus recommendations on these key issues. Following a systematic process as outlined by the National Academy of Medicine, a literature search and panel voting were used to rate the strength of evidence for each recommendation. This consensus statement provides evidence-based recommendations to help clinicians integrate immune checkpoint inhibitors into the treatment plan for patients with NSCLC. This guidance will be updated following relevant advances in the field. © 2018 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are treated for cure, but treatment decisions are not straightforward. Chemotherapy is essential due to the high risk of systemic relapse, but local therapy is also required for cure. In the small subset of stage III patients with N0 or N1 disease, surgery is typically the initial therapy and extended resections are frequent. The majority of IIIA patients present with N2 disease and treatment paradigms for these patients are controversial, particularly concerning the role of resection. Surgery has a limited role in bulky IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC disease, which is typically treated with combined systemic therapy and radiation. The authors believe that in resectable IIIA disease, the addition of surgery to multimodality treatment appears to improve local control and overall survival. Induction therapy is essential, and the use of chemotherapy alone or chemoradiotherapy remains an area of debate. Pneumonectomy should be used with caution in IIIA disease, as numerous prospective trials have noted excessive perioperative mortality. The introduction of immunotherapies in this stage may quickly transform treatment decisions. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {The emergence of immune checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of cancer has led to major changes to the therapeutic landscape of lung cancer. Improvements in overall survival relative to standard chemotherapy have been observed in the first-line and second-line therapy settings for patients with advanced non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who are treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Consequently, every patient with advanced-stage NSCLC is now a candidate for immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. However, it is clear that the benefit from therapy is not universal, and identification of biomarkers to select therapy has assumed importance. In addition to programmed cell death receptor ligand 1 expression, both tissue-based and blood-based markers are under evaluation to select patients. In an era of increasing costs of care and potential for toxicities related to immune checkpoint inhibition, proper patient selection is critical to the optimal use of this new class of agents. In addition, development of novel combination approaches has also emerged as an important way to improve the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibition. Studies in earlier stages of NSCLC are already underway with the hope of improving the cure rate.

	abstract = {Immunotherapy is among the most rapidly evolving treatment strategies in oncology. The therapeutic potential of immune-checkpoint inhibitors is exemplified by the recent hail of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approvals for their use in various malignancies. Continued efforts to enhance outcomes with immunotherapy agents have led to the formulation of advanced treatment strategies. Recent evidence from pre-clinical studies evaluating immune-checkpoint inhibitors in various cancer cell-lines has suggested that combinatorial approaches may have superior survival outcomes compared to single-agent immunotherapy regimens. Preliminary trials assessing combination therapy with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 plus anti-CTLA-4 immune-checkpoint inhibitors have documented considerable advantages in survival indices over single-agent immunotherapy. The therapeutic potential of combinatorial approaches is highlighted by the recent FDA approval of nivolumab plus ipilimumab for patients with advanced melanoma. Presently, dual-immune checkpoint inhibition with anti-programmed death receptor-1/programmed cell death receptor- ligand-1 (anti-PD-1/PD-L1) plus anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated antigen-4 (anti-CTLA-4) monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) is being evaluated for a wide range of tumor histologies. Furthermore, several ongoing clinical trials are investigating combination checkpoint inhibition in association with traditional treatment modalities such as chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation. In this review, we summarize the current landscape of combination therapy with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 plus anti-CTLA-4 MoAbs for patients with melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We present a synopsis of the prospects for expanding the indications of dual immune-checkpoint inhibition therapy to a more diverse set of tumor histologies. © 2018 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The medical history of cancer began millennia ago. Historical findings of patients with cancer date back to ancient Egyptian and Greek civilizations, where this disease was predominantly treated with radical surgery and cautery that were often ineffective, leading to the death of patients. Over the centuries, important discoveries allowed to identify the biological and pathological features of tumors, without however contributing to the development of effective therapeutic approaches until the end of the 1800s, when the discovery of X-rays and their use for the treatment of tumors provided the first modern therapeutic approach in medical oncology. However, a real breakthrough took place after the Second World War, with the discovery of cytotoxic antitumor drugs and the birth of chemotherapy for the treatment of various hematological and solid tumors. Starting from this epochal turning point, there has been an exponential growth of studies concerning the use of new drugs for cancer treatment. The second fundamental breakthrough in the field of oncology and pharmacology took place at the beginning of the '80s, thanks to molecular and cellular biology studies that allowed the development of specific drugs for some molecular targets involved in neoplastic processes, giving rise to targeted therapy. Both chemotherapy and target therapy have significantly improved the survival and quality of life of cancer patients inducing sometimes complete tumor remission. Subsequently, at the turn of the third millennium, thanks to genetic engineering studies, there was a further advancement of clinical oncology and pharmacology with the introduction of monoclonal antibodies and immune checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of advanced or metastatic tumors, for which no effective treatment was available before. Today, cancer research is always aimed at the study and development of new therapeutic approaches for cancer treatment. Currently, several researchers are focused on the development of cell therapies, anti-tumor vaccines, and new biotechnological drugs that have already shown promising results in preclinical studies, therefore, in the near future, we will certainly assist to a new revolution in the field of medical oncology.

Beyond the already approved indications in first- and second-line setting of advanced NSCLC, new data has recently emerged demonstrating its efficacy in locally advanced disease as maintenance after chemo-radiotherapy and currently several trials are also exploring its efficacy in earlier stages of the disease to evaluate whether these results could be extrapolated to the adjuvant setting. With the advent of all these new therapies, their potential in other thoracic malignancies such as mesothelioma and small-cell lung cancer are also being evaluated with encouraging preliminary data that endorses their short-term incorporation as new therapeutic options in these thoracic malignancies. However, despite all these new evidence, there are still several open questions that remain to be solved like the use of immune agents in special subpopulations such as elderly or fragile patients or the case of patients with brain metastases or autoimmune disorders. In addition some other open questions remain with regards ICIs activity in patients receiving corticosteroid or antibiotics, the potential use in oncogenic addicted tumours, as well as the safety of retreatment after the onset of immune-related adverse events (ir-AE) or the optimal dose schedule or time on treatment for ICIs administration. Herein, we propose to address all these questions, reviewing most recent evidence available in order to give readers some practical advises and guidance on how to deal with these challenges when treating NSCLC patients with immunotherapy. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The central nervous system (CNS) is regarded as an immune privileged environment; however, changes in the neuroimmunology paradigm have led to an increased interest in systematic immunotherapy in lung cancer therapy. The presence of the lymphatic system in the CNS as well as the physiological and biochemical changes in the blood–brain barrier in the tumor microenvironment suggests that immunocytes are fully capable of entering and exiting the CNS. Emerging clinical data suggest that inhibitors of programmed death receptor-1/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) can stimulate surrounding T cells and thus have antitumor effects in the CNS. For example, PD-1 antibody (pembrolizumab) monotherapy has displayed a 20–30% encephalic response rate in patients with brain metastases from malignant melanoma or non-small cell lung cancer. Combined application of nivolumab and ipilimumab anti-PD-1 and anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 showed an encephalic response rate of 55% in patients with brain metastases of melanoma. Further evidence is required to verify these response rates and identify the mechanisms of curative effects and drug tolerance. While regional treatments such as whole-brain radiosurgery, stereotactic radiosurgery, and brain surgery remain the mainstream, PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors display potential decreased neurotoxic effects. To date, five drugs have been approved for use in patients with encephalic metastases of lung carcinoma: the anti-PD-1 drugs, pembrolizumab and nivolumab, and the anti-PD-L1 agents, atezolizumab, durvalumab, and avelu-mab. In recent years, clinical trials of inhibitors in combination with other drugs to treat brain metastasis have also emerged. This review summarizes the biological principles of PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy for brain metastasis of lung cancer, as well as ongoing clinical trials to explore unmet needs. © 2020 Wang et al.},

	abstract = {Introduction: The prognosis of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains poor, with a 5-year overall survival rate of around 15%. Immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as programmed cell death protein 1 and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors, have opened a new era in the management of NSCLC. Three checkpoint inhibitors (nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and atezolizumab) are currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for advanced NSCLC. Durvalumab, an anti-PD-L1 antibody, is under investigation in several trials. Areas covered: This article reviews the pharmacological properties, clinical efficacy, and safety of durvalumab as monotherapy and in combination with other drugs for the treatment of locally advanced and advanced NSCLC. Expert opinion: Durvalumab as monotherapy or in combination with tremelimumab was effective with well-tolerated safety profiles for advanced NSCLC in several phase I or II studies. The PACIFIC study assessed the effectiveness of durvalumab as maintenance therapy following definitive chemoradiotherapy for unresectable stage III NSCLC, and met its primary endpoints of progression-free survival and overall survival. These results led to FDA approval for this NSCLC population. It will be exciting to follow ongoing phase III studies assessing how durvalumab fits into the rapidly evolving therapeutic landscape for advanced NSCLC. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint blockades have dramatically changed the landscape for second-line treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Based on the promising results of Keynote-024 presented so far, pembrolizumab has been approved as first-line treatment for advanced PD-L1 positive NSCLC patients. However, overall response rate (ORR) is limited to PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint blockades when used as single agent. Combining with chemotherapy, anti-CTLA-4 antibodies, targeted therapy, radiotherapy or other treatment options is perceived as an appealing method aimed at achieving higher efficacy. There are many clinical trials on going or finished assessing the efficacy and safety of the PD-1/PD-L1 blockades alone or combining with other approaches in first-line or second-line treatments. A lot of challenges need to be overcome before PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint blockades are widely used in the patients with NSCLC including the identification of optimal combination, treatment-related adverse effects, the high cost and lack of effective predictive markers. In this review, we focus on outlining current clinical trials and challenges for future research of PD-1/PD-L1 pathway checkpoint blockades in NSCLC. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Tumorigenic rearrangements in anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) account for 3–7% of all non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). Treatment with targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has shown impressive clinical responses. Crizotinib was the first agent approved for front-line therapy of ALK-rearranged NSCLC after it demonstrated superiority to chemotherapy in response rate, duration of response, and progression-free survival. However, eventually all patients progress on crizotinib therapy, with the central nervous system (CNS) being the most common site, which served as the impetus for the development of more potent next-generation ALK inhibitors. Currently, ceritinib, alectinib, and brigatinib are all approved for second-line therapy after progression on or intolerance to crizotinib. Investigations into whether the initiation of a second-generation ALK inhibitor as first-line therapy is the superior treatment paradigm has resulted in the approval of ceritinib as initial therapy. Alectinib has also shown impressive results as front-line therapy, as recently reported in two large randomized studies that compared it to crizotinib. There is a significant need to better understand the drivers of and mechanisms underlying resistance to ALK inhibitors. While specific mutations have been identified, there is currently only limited evidence that the identification of specific mutations should impact selection of the next ALK inhibitor. The best treatment option for patients who become TKI refractory is also unclear, though there is some evidence to suggests that these patients are not responsive to checkpoint inhibitors and may respond better to chemotherapy. Combination therapy with other classes of agents may help to overcome resistance mechanisms and should be investigated further. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.},

	abstract = {Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is an aggressive skin cancer. Until 2017, patients with advanced disease were typically treated with conventional chemotherapies, with a median response duration of 3 months. Increased evidence of the role of the immune system in controlling this cancer has paved the way for immune-based therapies, with programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death protein ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors at the frontline. Avelumab, an anti-PD-L1 antibody, was the first-ever drug approved in advanced MCC after showing meaningful efficacy in a second-line setting. Objective responses were observed in one-third of patients and, most importantly, were durable with half of patients and one-third of patients still alive at 1 and 2 years, respectively. When used in a first-line setting, PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors (avelumab, pembrolizumab, nivolumab) are even more promising as objective responses are observed in approximately 50–70% of patients within the first 4–8 weeks of treatment. Safety profiles are acceptable with 10–20% of patients experiencing adverse events grade ≥ 3. PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors are considered the standard of care in advanced MCC and are currently being investigated in the adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings. However, innovative treatments are still needed in the metastatic setting, as approximately 50% of these patients will not persistently respond to currently available immunotherapies, and no predictors of response are available yet. Therefore, other immunotherapeutic strategies are now being investigated—ideally in combinations—to enhance the various aspects of the immune response against tumoral cells. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Successful anticancer strategies require a differential response between tumor and normal tissue (i.e., a therapeutic ratio). In fact, improving the effectiveness of a cancer therapeutic is of no clinical value in the absence of a significant increase in the differential response between tumor and normal tissue. Although radiation dose escalation with the use of intensity modulated radiation therapy has permitted the maximum tolerable dose for most locally advanced cancers, improvements in tumor control without damaging normal adjacent tissues are needed. As a means of increasing the therapeutic ratio, several new approaches are under development. Drugs targeting signal transduction pathways in cancer progression and more recently, immunotherapeutics targeting specific immune cell subsets have entered the clinic with promising early results. Radiobiological research is underway to address pressing questions as to the dose per fraction, irradiated tumor volume and time sequence of the drug administration. To exploit these exciting novel strategies, a better understanding is needed of the cellular and molecular pathways responsible for both cancer and normal tissue and organ response, including the role of radiation-induced accelerated senescence.

Usually a combination of local therapy (surgery or radiotherapy, depending on functional, technical and oncological operability) with systemic platinum-based doublet chemotherapy and, recently, followed by immune therapy is used. A more aggressive approach of triple agent chemotherapy or two local therapies (surgery and radiotherapy, except for specific indications) has no benefit for overall survival. Until now tumour stage and the general condition of the patient are the most relevant prognostic factors. Characterising the tumour molecularly and immunologically may lead to a more personalised and effective approach. At the moment, after an exact staging and functional evaluation, an interdisciplinary discussion amongst the tumour board is warranted and offers the best management strategy. © ERS 2019.},

	abstract = {Most patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and without driver mutations get or will get in the near future pembrolizumab (high expressers of PD-L1) or a combination of PD-1-/PD-L1- with chemotherapy or perhaps a combination of PD-1- and CTLA4-inhibition. In stage III after chemoradiotherapy consolidation with durvalumab is in use. If there is a response to first-line therapy, most patients will still get a recurrence or progress. The question is what kind of therapy we can offer to these patients. With the introduction of PD-1- and PD-L1-inhibition in the recurrent disease situation we got a good treatment option with solid evidence from randomized trials. As these immune-checkpoint-inhibitors are moving in first-line we have to find alternatives for recurrent or refractory tumours. Until now almost no relevant data exist what the best options are. Extrapolating from the knowledge we have from earlier situations we can suggest the following scenarios, but they have to be confirmed by prospective clinical trials: (I) if in first-line pembrolizumab alone was given, probably a classical chemotherapy doublet should be given. In the case of mono/oligo-progression local therapies can be added. Alternatively the addition of a further immune modulating drug can be examined in clinical trials; (II) if in first-line a combination of immune-checkpoint-inhibition and chemotherapy was applied, probably classical second-line chemotherapy is reasonable. If in first-line pemetrexed was not given, it could be applied in non-squamous NSCLC for second-line. Else usually docetaxel will be chosen. The question of rapid recurrence/progression leads to the option of adding antiangiogenetic drugs in early progression/recurrence. Of course a further immune modulating drug can be tested in prospective clinical trials and in mono/oligo-progression local treatment can be discussed; (III) if in first-line a combination of PD-1- and CTLA4-inhibition was used, classical doublet chemotherapy is probably the preferred option. Alternatively prospective clinical trials can examine further immune modulating agents. In case of mono/ oligo-progression local treatments can be evaluated. For the situation of 2nd recurrence at the moment only individualized treatment decisions can be offered. Overall there is unfortunately no good evidence until now how to proceed after disease progression after treatment with immune-checkpoint-inhibitors. Prospective clinical trials in order to select good sequence options for the treatment of advance NSCLC without driver mutations are urgently needed. © Precision Cancer Medicine.

Lung cancer has much gene mutations, which is a characteristic of cancer caused by extrinsic factors, such as cigarette smoking. The heterogeneity underlined by genetic mutations results in the generation of resistant clones against chemotherapy and molecular targeted therapy. On the other hand, gene mutation products generate neoepitopes that are recognized as ‘non-self’ by T cell immune system. This is one of the reasons lung cancer is a good target for ICIs.

	abstract = {Purpose: To investigate the relationship between radiotherapy (RT), in particular chest RT, and development of immune-related (IR) pneumonitis in non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with anti–programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1). Patients and Methods: Between June 2011 and July 2017, NSCLC patients treated with anti–PD-1/PD-L1 at a tertiary-care academic cancer center were identified. Patient, treatment, prior RT (intent, technique, timing, courses), and IR pneumonitis details were collected. Treating investigators diagnosed IR pneumonitis clinically. Diagnostic IR pneumonitis scans were overlaid with available chest RT plans to describe IR pneumonitis in relation to prior chest RT. We evaluated associations between patient, treatment, RT details, and development of IR pneumonitis by Fisher exact and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Results: Of the 188 NSCLC patients we identified, median follow-up was 6.78 (range, 0.30-79.3) months and median age 66 (range, 39-91) years; 54% (n = 102) were male; and 42% (n = 79) had stage I-III NSCLC at initial diagnosis. Patients received anti–PD-1/PD-L1 monotherapy (n = 127, 68%) or PD-1/PD-L1-based combinations (n = 61, 32%). In the entire cohort, 70% (132/188) received any RT, 53% (100/188) chest RT, and 37% (70/188) curative-intent chest RT. Any grade IR pneumonitis occurred in 19% (36/188; 95% confidence interval, 13.8-25.6). Of those who developed IR pneumonitis and received chest RT (n = 19), patients were more likely to have received curative-intent versus palliative-intent chest RT (17/19, 89%, vs. 2/19, 11%; P = .051). Predominant IR pneumonitis appearances were ground-glass opacities outside high-dose chest RT regions. Conclusion: No RT parameter was significantly associated with IR pneumonitis. On subset analysis of patients who developed IR pneumonitis and who had received prior chest RT, IR pneumonitis was more common in patients who received curative-intent chest RT. Attention should be paid to NSCLC patients receiving curative-intent RT followed by anti–PD-1/PD-L1 agents. In patients with non–small-cell lung cancer treated with anti–PD-1/PD-L1 agents, no specific radiation parameter was significantly associated with immune-related (IR) pneumonitis. We identify on subset analysis of patients who developed IR pneumonitis and received chest radiation, patients were numerically more likely to have received chest radiation with curative intent than with palliative intent (89% vs. 11%), that approached statistical significance. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

Immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting either the programmed death (PD)-1 receptor or its ligand PD-L1 were first approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the management of metastatic melanoma in 2011. The approval of this class is being extended to include other types of immunogenic tumors. Although breast cancer (BC) was first categorized as non-immunogenic tumor type, there are certain subsets of BC that showed a high level of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). Those subsets include the triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and HER-2 positive breast tumors. Preliminary data from clinical trials presented promising outcomes for patients with advanced stage/metastatic TNBC. While the objective response rate (ORR) was relatively low, it is still promising because of the observation that the patients who respond to the treatment with immune checkpoint blockade have favorable prognosis and often show a significant increase in the overall survival. Therefore, the main challenge is to find ways to enhance the tumor response to such therapy and to convert the non-responders to responders. This will consequently bring new hopes for patients with advanced stage metastatic TNBC and help to decrease death tolls from this devastating disease. In the current review, we are highlighting and discussing the up-to-date strategies adopted at either the preclinical or the clinical settings to enhance tumor responsiveness to immunotherapy. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

While targeted therapies have redefined treatment options for non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) with genetic aberrations such as epidermal growth factor and anaplastic lymphoma kinase, many patients do not harbour these oncogenic drivers. Cancer immunology has enabled the development of immune modulators that has dramatically altered the therapeutic landscape of advanced NSCLC. The success of immune-checkpoint inhibitors in pretreated NSCLC has led to the conduct of multiple studies exploring their role in the first-line setting. This article provides an overview of the evolving landscape of immune-checkpoint inhibitors with a focus on the programmed cell-death 1 (PD-1; pembrolizumab, nivolumab) and programmed cell-death ligand 1 (PD-L1; atezolizumab, durvalumab, avelumab) immune-checkpoint inhibitors as single agent or in combination with either chemotherapy or with another immune-checkpoint inhibitor in the treatment of NSCLC, the challenges faced, as well as future perspectives. © The Author(s), 2019.},

	abstract = {Purpose of the Review: Brain metastasis is a common complication of advanced malignancies, especially, lung cancer, breast cancer, renal cell carcinoma, and melanoma. Traditionally surgery, when indicated, and radiation therapy, either as whole-brain radiation therapy or stereotactic radiosurgery, constituted the major treatment options for brain metastases. Until recently, most of the systemic chemotherapy agents had limited activity for brain metastases. However, with the advent of small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors and immunotherapy agents, there has been renewed interest in using these agents in the management of brain metastases. Recent Findings: Immune checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized the treatment of metastatic melanoma, lung cancer, kidney cancer, and bladder cancer among others. They modulate the immune system to recognize tumor antigens as “non-self” antigens and mount an immune response against them. Summary: Initial studies of using immune checkpoint inhibitors in brain metastases have shown promising activity, and several clinical trials are currently underway. Studies are also assessing the combination of radiation therapy and immunotherapy in brain metastases. The results of these ongoing clinical trials have the potential to change the therapeutic paradigm in patients with brain metastases. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Objectives. To evaluate the efficacy of immuno-oncology combinational therapy (IOCT) versus monotherapy with programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) or PD-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors or conventional therapies, i.e., non-IOCT, in patients with advanced solid tumors. Methods. We systematically searched the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases from January 2015 to October 2018 for eligible studies. We included randomized trials of IOCT with available hazard ratios (HR) for death. The random effects model was used to calculate pooled HR for death; heterogeneity was assessed using I2 statistics. The main outcome measure was overall survival (OS). Results. After screening 483 relevant articles, we identified twelve trials comprising 5388 patients for quantitative analysis. IOCT-treated patients had significantly higher tumor response rate (relative risk (RR): 2.51, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.82-3.47), prolonged progression-free survival (HR 0.62, 95% CI: 0.53-0.74), and OS (HR 0.69, 95% CI: 0.61-0.78), compared with non-IOCT-treated patients. Sensitivity analyses also demonstrated the OS advantage of IOCT across different combination modalities, intervention agents, malignancy types, and PD-L1 expression (all P<0.05). Notably, there were higher odds of high-grade (grade≥3) adverse events with IOCT (RR: 1.81, 95% CI: 1.13-2.90), but the risk of treatment-related death (RR: 1.16, 95% CI: 0.84-1.60) was not increased compared with non-IOCT. Conclusions. IOCT is a preferable treatment option over PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor monotherapy and conventional therapy for patients with advanced solid tumors. However, we should note the increased incidence rate of high-grade AEs in IOCT. © 2020 Run-Cong Nie et al.},

	abstract = {Background: Immuno-oncological (IO) therapies such as PD-1 and PD-L1 antibodies have been introduced in the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) since 2015 based on randomized trials showing unprecedented advantages in overall survival (OS) with hazard ratios (HRs) between 0.5 and 0.7. The impact of these treatments on OS in routine clinical practice and the role of tumor mass have not been studied. Methods: 557 consecutive patients with inoperable stage III or stage IV NSCLC diagnosed in our certified lung cancer center from 2006 to 2018 were included if they had received at least one line of systemic treatment. OS of immuno-oncologically treated patients (IO patients, n = 144) who received treatment with a PD-1 antibody (nivolumab [n = 77] or pembrolizumab [n = 51]) or a PD-L1 antibody (atezolizumab [n = 4] or durvalumab [n = 12]) was compared to historic controls treated before availability of IO treatment (n = 413) using case-control analysis. IO patients and historic controls were individually matched for stage, performance state, histology, smoking status, gender, age, and initial treatment mode (palliative vs. definitive radio-chemotherapy). Results: Case-control analysis of 91 matched pairs showed significantly longer OS in IO patients compared to historic controls (21.2 vs. 10.9 months, HR 0.526, CI 0.373-0.723). The benefit was more pronounced in patients with lower tumor stage (HR 0.48 [stage III], 0.40 [IVA], 0.63 [IVB]) or smaller tumor size (HR 0.38 [RECIST ≤57 mm], 0.40 [RECIST 58-94 mm], 0.59 [RECIST 95-141 mm], 0.75 [RECIST ≥142 mm]). Conclusions: IO patients showed significant benefit in OS with HRs comparable to those reported in phase III trials. The benefit tended to be greater in patients with lower tumor mass. © 2019 S.

The main therapeutic trials that have resulted in marketing authorisations for use of ICIs in lung cancer were reported. A particular focus was on the toxicity of these new molecules in relation to their immune-related adverse events. The need for biological selection, currently based on immunohistochemistry testing to identify the tumour expression of programmed death ligand (PD-L)1, was stressed, as well as the need to harmonise PD-L1 testing and techniques. Finally, sessions were dedicated to the combination of ICIs and radiotherapy and the place of ICIs in nonsmall cell lung cancer with oncogenic addictions. Finally, an important presentation was dedicated to the future of antitumour vaccination and of all ongoing trials in thoracic oncology. Copyright ©ERS 2018},

	abstract = {The treatment landscape has changed since the immune checkpoint inhibitors were approved in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Although the promising clinical benefit from programmed death-1/programmed death ligand-1 (PD-1/PD-L1) inhibitors was observed in the second or subsequent line treatment of patients who progressed on chemotherapy, it has a long way for single PD-1/ PD-L1 inhibitor to move forward to the frontline without a predictive biomarker. Tumor response is far from satisfactory without selection and primary or acquired resistance to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors hampered their utility. Therefore, it is crucial to determine a strategy that can optimize the application of immune checkpoint inhibitors and increase the numbers of the responders. Multiple combination approaches based on PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors are designed and aimed to boost anti-tumor response and benefit a broader population. In this review, we will integrate the updated clinical data to highlight the four most promising combination strategies in advance NSCLC: combination of checkpoint inhibition with chemotherapy, antiangiogenesis, immunotherapy and radiotherapy.

This phase III clinical trial showed that the use of adjuvant osimertinib in stage IB–IIIA NSCLC patients harboring EGFR mutations had a clinically meaningful benefit. In locally advanced NSCLC, the recent studies investigated the role of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) administred early with or before concurrent chemoradiotherapy. In advanced-stage NSCLC with driver mutations, new targets and drugs were explored. The major step forward was the approval of personalized treatment in very uncommon genomic alterations, as RET fusions or MET mutations. In advanced NSCLC without targetable mutations, some new immunotherapy combination strategies have been presented. One of such combination was tiragolumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor binding to TIGIT, evaluated with atezolizumab. There were also data from the Checkmate 227 and Checkmate 9LA trials that led to recent approvals. © 2020},

Because results from phase I/II trials of IDO-1 inhibitor monotherapy have been disappointing, current clinical trials employ IDO-1 inhibitors in combination strategies with other immunotherapy agents or with chemotherapy ± radiation. Combinations with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies are already showing promise, and related strategies are under active evaluation. Summary: While further research is needed to elucidate the precise role of IDO-1 in tumor development, its mechanisms of action appear sufficiently distinct from other immunotherapy targets to warrant inclusion in combination immunotherapy regimens, an approach where multiple clinical trials are currently underway. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Consolidation durvalumab after chemoradiation (CRT) is the current standard of care for locally advanced NSCLC. We hypothesized that adding immunotherapy concurrently with CRT (cCRT) would increase efficacy without additive toxicity. Methods: This phase II study was conducted in two parts. Part 1 (n = 10) involved administration of conventionally fractionated CRT followed by consolidation chemotherapy (atezolizumab [two cycles] and maintenance atezolizumab up to 1 y). Part 2 (n = 30) involved administration of cCRT with atezolizumab followed by the same consolidation and maintenance therapies as in part 1. Programmed cell death ligand-1 staining cutoffs (1% or 50%) using Dako 22C3 immunohistochemistry were correlated with clinical outcomes. Results: The overall toxicities for part 1/2 were overall adverse events of grade 3 and above of 80%/80%; immune-related adverse events of grade 3 and above of 30%/20%; and pneumonitis of grade 2 and above of 10%/16%, respectively. In part 1, for preliminary efficacy results, with a median follow-up of 22.5 months, the median progression-free survival was 18.6 months, and the overall survival was 22.8 months. In part 2, with a median follow-up time of 15.1 months, the median progression-free survival was 13.2 months, and the overall survival was not reached. There was no difference in cancer recurrence regardless of programmed cell death ligand-1 status. Conclusions: Atezolizumab with cCRT is safe and feasible and has no added toxicities compared with historical rates. © 2019 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer},

	abstract = {Over the last decade, the immune checkpoint blockade targeting the programmed death protein 1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) axis has improved progression-free and overall survival of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. PD-L1 tumor expression, along with tumor mutational burden, is currently being explored as a predictive biomarker for responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). However, lung cancer patients may have insufficient tumor tissue samples and the high bleeding risk often prevents additional biopsies and, as a consequence, immunohistological evaluation of PD-L1 expression. In addition, PD-L1 shows a dynamic expression profile and can be influenced by intratumoral heterogeneity as well as the immune cell infiltrate in the tumor and its microenvironment, influencing the response rate to PD-1/PD-L1 axis ICIs. Therefore, to identify subgroups of patients with advanced NSCLC that will most likely benefit from ICI therapies, molecular characterization of PD-L1 expression in circulating tumor cells (CTCs) might be supportive. In this review, we highlight the use of CTCs as a complementary diagnostic tool for PD-L1 expression analysis in advanced NSCLC patients. In addition, we examine technical issues of PD-L1 measurement in tissue as well as in CTCs. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {For more than a decade, there has been no improvement in outcomes for patients with unresectable locally advanced (la) non-small-cell lung cancer (nsclc). The standard treatment in that setting is definitive concurrent chemotherapy and radiation (ccrt). Although the intent of treatment is curative, most patients rapidly progress, and their prognosis is poor, with a 5-year overall survival (os) rate in the 15%–25% range. Those patients therefore represent a critical unmet need, warranting expedited approval of, and access to, new treatments that can improve outcomes. The pacific trial, which evaluated durvalumab consolidation therapy after ccrt in unresectable la nsclc, demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival (pfs) and a significant improvement in os. Durvalumab thus fills a critical unmet need in the setting of unresectable la nsclc and provides a new option for patients treated with curative intent. Here, we review the treatment of unresectable la nsclc, with a focus on the effect of the clinical data for durvalumab. © 2019 Multimed Inc.},

	abstract = {The use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has become one of the most promising approaches in the field of cancer therapy. Unlike the current therapies that target tumor cells, such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or targeted therapy, ICIs directly restore the exhausted host antitumor immune responses mediated by the tumors. Among multiple immune modulators identified, the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death protein ligand 1 (PD-L1) axis leading to the exhaustion of T-cell immunity in chronic infections and tumors has been widely investigated. Therefore, blocking antibodies targeting PD-1 or PD-L1 have been developed and approved for the treatment of various advanced cancers, including non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), making them the most successful ICIs. Compared with chemotherapy or radiotherapy, PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy significantly improves the durable response rate and prolongs long-term survival with limited adverse effects in both monotherapy and combination therapy for advanced NSCLC. However, extensive challenges exist for further clinical applications, such as a small fraction of benefit population, primary and acquired resistance, the lack of predictive and prognostic biomarkers, and treatment-related adverse effects. In this article, we summarize the latest clinical applications of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy in advanced NSCLC worldwide, as well as in China, and discuss the bottlenecks related to the use of this therapy in clinical practice. An exploration of the underlying mechanism of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy and biomarker identification will maximize the application of ICIs in advanced NSCLC and facilitate bedside-to-bench studies in cancer immunotherapy as well. Implications for Practice: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and programmed cell death protein ligand 1 (PD-L1) display apparent benefits for the treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the clinical applications of these therapies are challenged by the limited benefit population with additional high economic burden and adverse events. This review discusses the bottlenecks of ICI therapy in clinical practice and provides appropriate guidance in the development of predictive biomarkers, the establishment of the criteria for combining PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy with the existing therapies, and the management of adverse events observed both in monotherapy and combination therapy, which will help maximize the applications of ICIs in advanced NSCLC. © AlphaMed Press 2019},

The purpose of this article is to review the most innovative and clinically promising ICB-based combinations designed to improve the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy.Recent findingsFirst-line combinatorial treatment with ipilimumab and nivolumab has recently shown to be superior to the standard of care in a subset of metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The combination of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/PD-L1 blockade with antiangiogenics has demonstrated a consistent clinical efficacy, especially for the combination of bevacizumab and atezolizumab as first-line therapy in metastatic RCC. The sequential combination of definitive chemoradiotherapy followed by durvalumab maintenance in advanced, unresectable NSCLC became the new standard of care, while the addition of pembrolizumab to first-line chemotherapy in metastatic NSCLC significantly improves overall survival. Despite promising results for the combination of ICBs with v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B/MAPK/ERK kinase inhibitors or epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors, especially in melanoma and NSCLC, safety concerns slowed down the development of such strategies.SummaryImmunotherapy-based combinations are becoming the standard of care for cancer treatment, in particularly for advanced melanoma, NSCLC and RCC. © 2018 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

	abstract = {Background: Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal type of cancers, with an overall five-year survival rate of less than 5%. It is usually diagnosed at an advanced stage with limited therapeutic options. To date, no effective treatment options have demonstrated long-term benefits in advanced pancreatic cancer patients. Compared with other cancers, pancreatic cancer exhibits remarkable resistance to conventional therapy and possesses a highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Main body: In this review, we summarized the evidence and unique properties of TME in pancreatic cancer that may contribute to its resistance towards immunotherapies as well as strategies to overcome those barriers. We reviewed the current strategies and future perspectives of combination therapies that (1) promote T cell priming through tumor associated antigen presentation; (2) inhibit tumor immunosuppressive environment; and (3) break-down the desmoplastic barrier which improves tumor infiltrating lymphocytes entry into the TME. Conclusions: It is imperative for clinicians and scientists to understand tumor immunology, identify novel biomarkers, and optimize the position of immunotherapy in therapeutic sequence, in order to improve pancreatic cancer clinical trial outcomes. Our collaborative efforts in targeting pancreatic TME will be the mainstay of achieving better clinical prognosis among pancreatic cancer patients. Ultimately, pancreatic cancer will be a treatable medical condition instead of a death sentence for a patient. © 2019 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Objectives: Immunotherapy (IO) has altered the non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) therapeutic landscape. However, the majority of patients do not respond to immune-checkpoint blockade, and subsequently either receive further chemotherapy or are referred for clinical trials. Here we examined the outcomes and predictors of response to IO in early phase clinical trials. Materials and methods: We analyzed the records of 74 patients with metastatic NSCLC that were enrolled on phase 1 IO trials within MD Anderson Cancer Center from 1/2010 to 7/2017. Results: The median age was 68, with a median follow-up of 12.3 months. The median lines of prior therapy was three. There were 53 patients who did not receive any IO as a prior line of treatment with a mOS of 8.2 months and mPFS of 3.4 months. There were 21 patients who progressed on a prior IO agent and subsequently went on an IO study with a mOS of 10.5 months and mPFS of 4.3 months, which was similar to patients who did not receive IO OS HR 0.81 (P =.51) and PFS HR 0.85 (P =.59). Royal Marsden Hospital (RMH) prognostic score >1 was predictive of decreased OS HR 3.59 (P =.014) although PFS was not statistically different. MDACC prognostic score was predictive of both OS HR 3.39 (P =.0002) and PFS HR 1.9 (P =.030). ANC/ALC ratio (NLR) of >6 was predictive of decreased survival mOS 3.2 months compared to NLR <6 mOS 11 months; HR 3.0 (P =.0023). Conclusions: In our heavily pretreated patient population with NSCLC, early phase clinical trials with IO demonstrated similar outcomes to those seen in larger clinical studies that also used immune checkpoint inhibitors. The addition of NLR to RMH and MDACC prognostic scores can identify patients with poor overall outcomes treated with early phase IO studies. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Molecular targeted therapy has greatly advanced the field of treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which accounts for the majority of lung cancers. Indeed, gefitinib, which was the first molecular targeted therapeutic agent, has actually doubled the survival time of NSCLC patients. Vigorous efforts of clinicians and researchers have revealed that lung cancer develops through the activating mutations of many driver genes including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), c-ros oncogene 1 (ROS1), v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF), and rearranged during transfection (RET) genes. Although ALK, ROS1, and RET are rare genetic abnormalities, corresponding tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) can exert dramatic therapeutic effects. In addition to anticancer drugs targeting driver genes, bevacizumab specifically binds to human vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and blocks the VEGF signaling pathway. The VEGF signal blockade suppresses angiogenesis in tumor tissues and inhibits tumor growth. In this review, we also explore immunotherapy, which is a promising new NSCLC treatment approach. In general, antitumor immune responses are suppressed in cancer patients, and cancer cells escape from the immune surveillance mechanism. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are antibodies that target the primary escape mechanisms, immune checkpoints. Patients who respond to ICIs are reported to experience long-lasting therapeutic effects. A wide range of clinical approaches, including combination therapy involving chemotherapy or radiation plus adjuvant therapy, are being developed. © 2019 Bentham Science Publishers.},

Expert commentary: Combination therapy with EGFR-TKIs and various other treatment options are under investigation in clinical studies. Although early studies failed to show a clinical benefit for such combination therapy because of a lack of patient selection, clinical studies with patient selection based on EGFR mutation status have shown promising results.

	abstract = {Immune checkpoints normally stop the body from mounting an immune response against healthy cells. Some cancers can acquire these checkpoints so that the tumour cells are not recognised by the immune system. Inhibiting the checkpoints therefore enables the tumour cells to be recognised and allows an immune response to be activated against them. Immune checkpoint inhibitors can improve the survival of some patients with advanced malignancies. These include malignant melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, urothelial bladder cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. Trials have shown that immune checkpoint inhibitors have significant benefits over conventional therapies so they are increasingly being used in routine clinical practice. However, a significant proportion of patients will not respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors and retain a poor prognosis. The optimal use of these drugs requires further study. Immune-related adverse events commonly include pneumonitis, hepatitis, nephritis, colitis and endocrinopathies. However, nearly any organ system can be affected.

In the first-line setting, the addition of the anti-programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibody atezolizumab to chemotherapy improves overall survival (OS). In patients with relapsed disease, data from nonrandomized trials have revealed promising responses, although a significant improvement in OS over that obtained with conventional chemotherapy was not achieved in a randomized trial in this setting. Substantial research interest exists in identifying predictive biomarkers that could guide the use of ICIs in patients with SCLC. PD-L1 expression is typically low or absent in SCLC, which has precluded its use as a predictive biomarker. Tumour mutational burden might have some predictive value, although blood-based measures of tumour mutational burden did not have predictive value in patients receiving atezolizumab plus chemotherapy in the first-line setting. After three decades, ICIs have finally enabled an improvement in OS for patients with SCLC; however, a substantial amount of research remains to be done, including identifying the optimal therapeutic strategy and predictive biomarkers.

At the ESMO Asia Meeting in November 2018, it was decided by both the ESMO and the Korean Society of Medical Oncology (KSMO) to convene a special face-to-face guidelines meeting in 2019 in Seoul. The aim was to adapt the ESMO 2017 guidelines to take into account potential differences related to ethnicity, cancer biology and standard practices associated with the treatment of locally-advanced, unresectable NSCLC in Asian patients. These guidelines represent the consensus opinions reached by those experts in the treatment of patients with lung cancer who represented the oncology societies of Korea (KSMO), China (CSCO), India (ISMPO), Japan (JSMO), Malaysia (MOS), Singapore (SSO) and Taiwan (TOS). The voting was based on scientific evidence, and it was independent of both local current treatment practices and the treatment availability and reimbursement situations in the individual participating Asian countries. © 2019 European Society for Medical Oncology},

	abstract = {Despite decades of research, prognosis for SCLC patients remains poor, and treatment options limited. SCLC is an immunogenic tumor with high somatic mutation rates due to tobacco exposure resulting in potential neo-antigens, the presence of suppressed immune responses, and occurrence of paraneoplastic disorders. The use of T cell immune-checkpoint inhibitors (anti-PD1: nivolumab, pembrolizumab; anti-PD-L1: atezolizumab, durvalumab; anti-CTLA-4: ipilimumab, tremelimumab) have shown promising antitumor activity with the potential to prolong survival in SCLC patients. In fact, atezolizumab when combined with chemotherapy has achieved the milestone of being the first drug to improve survival in patients with newly diagnosed extensive-stage SCLC. Other immunotherapeutic approaches evaluated in clinical trials for SCLC include the use of cytokines, cancer vaccines, antiganglioside therapies, TLR9 inhibition, anti-Notch signaling, and anti-CD47. This review discusses the rationale and clinical evidence of immunotherapy in SCLC, the conflictive clinical results of novel immunotherapeutic agents and combinatorial therapies under evaluation in SCLC patients. © 2019, Federación de Sociedades Españolas de Oncología (FESEO).},

	abstract = {In recent years, immunotherapy has revolutionized and changed the standard of care in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Immune checkpoint inhibitors, fundamentally those that act by blocking the programmed cell death receptor-1 (PD-1) and its ligand the programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) have emerged as novel treatment strategies in NSCLC, demonstrating undoubted superiority over chemotherapy in terms of efficacy. Several of these immune checkpoint modulators have recently gained regulatory approval for the treatment of advanced NSCLC, such as nivolumab, atezolizumab and pembrolizumab in first-line (only the latter) and second-line settings, and more recently, durvalumab as maintenance after chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced disease. There is consensus that PD-L1 expression on tumor cells predicts responsiveness to PD-1 inhibitors in several tumor types. Hence PD-L1 expression evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) is currently used as a clinical decision-making tool to support the use of checkpoint inhibitors in NSCLC patients. However, the value of PD-L1 as the ‘definitive’ biomarker is controversial as its testing is puzzled by multiple unsolved issues such as the use of different staining platforms and antibodies, the type of cells in which PD-L1 is assessed (tumor versus immune cells), thresholds used for PD-L1-positivity, or the source and timing for sample collection. Therefore, newer biomarkers such as tumor mutation burden and neoantigens as well as biomarkers reflecting host environment (microbiome) or tumor inflamed microenvironment (gene expression signatures) are being explored as more reliable and accurate alternatives to IHC for guiding treatment selection with checkpoint inhibitors in NSCLC. © The Author(s), 2018.},

	abstract = {Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are newer, immunotherapy-based drugs that have been shown to improve survival in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Unlike traditional chemotherapeutic agents, ICIs work by boosting the body's natural tumor killing response. However, this unique mechanism of action has also led to the recognition of class-specific side effects. Labeled immune-related adverse events, these toxicities can affect multiple organ systems including the lungs. Immune-mediated lung injury because of ICI use, termed checkpoint inhibitor pneumonitis (CIP), occurs in about 3% to 5% of patients receiving ICIs; however, the real-world incidence of this entity may be higher, especially now that ICIs are being used in nonclinical trial settings. In this review, we briefly introduce the biology of ICIs and the indications for ICI use in NSCLC and then discuss the epidemiology and clinical and radiologic manifestations of CIP. Next, we discuss management strategies for CIP, including the current consensus on management of steroid-refractory CIP. Given the nascent nature of this field, we highlight areas of uncertainty and emerging research questions in the burgeoning field of checkpoint inhibitor pulmonary toxicity. © 2018 American College of Chest Physicians},

However, EGFR+ NSCLCs gain acquired resistance to these agents, representing one of the key challenges for modern precision oncology. Objective: Therefore, this paper aims to provide an extensive state of the art review, alongside with hints about future perspectives. Conclusion: To date, in the light of the data from the FLAURA study, osimertinib represents the best first-line option in NSCLC patients with EGFR activating mutations; EGFR-TKI plus chemotherapy combination therapies, even though interesting, must still be considered investigational. © 2019 Bentham Science Publishers.},

Although progress in the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has been made over the past decade, the 5-year survival rate in patients with lung cancer remains only 10%–20%. Obviously, new therapeutic options are required for patients with advanced NSCLC and unmet medical needs. Cancer immunotherapy is an evolving treatment modality that uses a patient’s own immune systems to fight cancer. Theoretically, cancer immunotherapy can result in long-term cancer remission and may not cause the same side effects as chemotherapy and radiation. Immuno-oncology has become an important focus of basic research as well as clinical trials for the treatment of NSCLC. Immune checkpoint inhibitors are the most promising approach for cancer immunotherapy and they have become the standard of care for patients with advanced NSCLC.

Since seminal studies in the early 90’s introduced concurrent chemo-radiotherapy as standard of care for treatment of this disease, no major advances have been introduced in this landscape. Both radiation dose escalation and neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy strategies were unsuccessful to improve the survival over standard of care radiation dose and chemotherapy schedule: five-year overall survival (OS) ranging from 15-20%. However, in 2017 the PACIFIC Trial demonstrated that the addition of consolidative immune checkpoint inhibitor durvalumab for one year led to superior progression free survival (PFS) and 3-year overall survival with no significant increase in toxicity compared to placebo in patients who achieved disease control with concurrent chemo-RT. Areas covered: This article reviews the treatment evolution of stage III NSCLC over the past decades, discusses current standard of care strategies and highlights potential future directions for the management of this condition. Expert opinion: Ongoing trials incorporating upfront checkpoint inhibitors with radiotherapy will answer whether adding checkpoint inhibitors to chemotherapy or substituting them for chemotherapy altogether will improve long-term outcome. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Improvements have been made in the outcomes of patients with NSCLC due to advancements in radiotherapy (RT) techniques, the use of concurrent chemotherapy with RT, and the emergence of immunotherapy as first- and second-line treatment in the metastatic setting. RT remains the mainstay treatment in patients with inoperable early-stage NSCLC and is given concurrently or sequentially with chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced unresectable disease. There is emerging evidence that RT not only provides local tumor control but also may influence systemic control. Multiple preclinical studies have demonstrated that RT induces immunomodulatory effects in the local tumor microenvironment, supporting a synergistic combination approach with immunotherapy to improve systemic control. Immunotherapy options that could be combined with RT include programmed cell death-1/programmed cell death ligand-1 blockers, as well as investigational agents such as OX-40 agonists, toll-like receptor agonists, indolea-mine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 inhibitors, and cytokines. Here, we describe the rationale for the integration of RT and immunotherapy in patients with NSCLC, present safety and efficacy data that support this combination strategy, review planned and ongoing studies, and highlight unanswered questions and future research needs.  ©2018 American Association for Cancer Research.},

	abstract = {There has been no improvement in outcome for patients with unresectable locally advanced (stage III) non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) for more than 10 years. The standard treatment for these patients is definitive concurrent chemotherapy and radiation (CCRT). Although the goal of treatment in this setting is to achieve a cure, most patients progress and their prognosis is poor, with a 5-year survival rate of 15–30%. There is thus an urgent need for the development of novel anticancer treatments in this patient population. Recent advances in cancer immunotherapy have led to a marked improvement in clinical outcome for advanced NSCLC. Such immunotherapy mainly consists of the administration of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) such as antibodies to cytotoxic T lymphocyte–associated protein–4 (CTLA-4) or to either programmed cell death–1 (PD-1) or its ligand PD-L1. Durvalumab (MEDI4736) is a high-affinity human immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody that blocks the binding of PD-L1 on tumor cells or antigen-presenting cells to PD-1 on T cells. The PACIFIC study recently evaluated consolidation immunotherapy with durvalumab versus placebo administered after concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) in patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC. It revealed a significant improvement in both progression-free and overall survival with durvalumab, and this improvement was associated with a favorable safety profile. This achievement has made durvalumab a standard of care for consolidation after CCRT in patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC, and it has now been approved in this setting by regulatory agencies in the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia, Switzerland, Malaysia, Singapore, India, and the United Arab Emirates. In this review, we briefly summarize the results of the PACIFIC trial, including those of post hoc analysis, and we address possible molecular mechanisms, perspectives, and remaining questions related to combined treatment with CCRT and ICIs in this patient population. © 2019 Inoue and Okamoto.},

	abstract = {Targeted therapies are efficient in the context of oncogenic driver mutations. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutant lung cancers represent a distinct subset of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with marked sensitivity to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Despite the high response rate to EGFR TKIs in EGFR-mutant lung cancer, resistance and tumor recurrence are unavoidable. Therapeutic options are restricted in patients after exhaustion of targeted therapies. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) represent a novel therapeutic option for advanced NSCLC with significant overall survival benefit in registration trials. No superiority in terms of long-term survival was observed in the EGFR mutation subgroup when ICIs were given as monotherapy in second-line treatment in earlier studies. Thus, the appropriate application of ICIs to patients harboring EGFR mutations remains an important field of ongoing research. Here, we discuss different immune checkpoint blockade strategies, including ICIs alone and in combination with TKIs, chemotherapy, radiation, and antiangiogenic agents in EGFR-mutant NSCLC as first-line and subsequent treatments. We also summarize the evidence concerning the heterogeneous molecular features and immune signatures of EGFR mutations and their associations with ICI therapy outcomes. This study was performed to improve our understanding of the optimal mode of immune-based treatment approaches in EGFR-mutant NSCLC. © The Author(s), 2020.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a tumor with a poor prognosis, often diagnosed in an advanced stage. Despite aggressive treatment of early and locally advanced disease, SCLC often relapses. First line chemotherapy provides good response rates in advanced disease, but progression free and overall survival are limited. New drugs such as some targeted therapies and immune therapies are promising in SCLC. Areas covered: In this review, we discuss the preclinical rationale and trial data for targeted therapies and immune therapies in SCLC, with a specific focus on clinical trials. Expert commentary: Lack of identification of clear prognostic and predictive biomarkers has limited the advances in treatment efficacy. This has most likely been the main cause of failure for compounds tested so far. Due to the highly mutational profile and the rapid growth pattern of SCLC, immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy seems the most promising treatment option. Concerning targeted agents, achievements made so far are small, but DLL3-antibodies or combinations of PARPi and immunotherapy could be very promising. These promising strategies also need testing in limited disease. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Immune checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonitis (ICI-P) during cancer treatment is rarely observed (<5%). ICI-P is more often observed in patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) than in those with other cancers. Likewise, it is more common in those receiving programmed cell death (PD)-1/ PD-1 ligand inhibitors rather than cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen (CTLA)-4 inhibitors alone. The frequency of ICI-P is higher when anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 are administered concomitantly. Despite the low fatality rate (≈13%), ICI-P is the leading cause of ICI-related deaths. This narrative review focuses on the epidemiology, clinical and radiological presentation and prognosis of ICI-P occurring in patients, especially those with advanced NSCLC. Emphasis is placed on the differences in terms of frequency or clinical picture observed depending on whether the ICI is used as monotherapy or in combination with another ICI or chemotherapy. Other pulmonary complications observed in cancer patients, yet not necessarily immune-related, are reviewed, such as sarcoid-like granulomatosis, tuberculosis or other infections. A proposal for pragmatic management, including differential diagnosis and therapeutic strategies, is presented, based on the ICI-P series reported in the literature and published guidelines. © ERS 2019.},

However, the shortcomings of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors have been observed, including low objective response rates and acquired tumor resistance, especially in patients receiving PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors as a single treatment. Accumulating evidence from clinical trials increasingly suggests that combined immunotherapies enhance therapeutic responses in patients with malignances, especially for GI tumors which have a complex matrix, and significant molecular and immunological differences. Preclinical and clinical studies suggest there are advantages to combined immunological regimens, which represents the next logical step in this field, although further research is necessary. This literature review explores the current limitations of monotherapies, before critically discussing the rationale behind combination regimens.

This new standard first-line approach opens a gap in standard second-line treatment, and older combinations may again become standard of care after progression during treatment with an ICI. The characterization of predictive biomarkers, patient selection, the definition of strategies with ICI combinations upon progression during treatment with ICIs, as well as prospective evaluation of the efficacy of ICIs in subpopulations (such as patients with poor performance status or brain metastases) represent upcoming challenges in advanced thoracic malignancies. In oncogene-addicted NSCLC three major steps were taken during 2018: next-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors have overtaken more established agents as the new standard of care in EGFR and ALK receptor tyrosine kinase gene (ALK)-positive tumors. Mechanisms of acquired resistance have been reported among patients treated with next-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, reflecting the diversity of the landscape. One major step forward was the approval of personalized treatment in very uncommon genomic alterations, mainly fusions. This raises a new question about the challenge of implementation of next-generation sequencing in daily clinical practice to detect new and uncommon genomic alterations and to capture the heterogeneity of the mechanisms of acquired resistance during treatment, as well as the need to extend research into new therapeutic strategies to overcome them. © 2019 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer},

This review examines the current standard practices and ongoing studies on the management of locally advanced, unresectable NSCLC. Recent Findings: Concurrent chemoradiation is the cornerstone of treatment of unresectable, locally advanced NSCLC. However, chemoradiation can be associated with high therapy-related toxicities, and risk of disease relapse remains significantly elevated despite treatment with curative intent. Durvalumab, a PD-L1 inhibitor, was recently approved as consolidation therapy following concurrent chemoradiation; this agent represents a major advancement in treatment of unresectable stage III NSCLC. Several clinical trials are currently underway to evaluate the benefit of different immunotherapy sequencing and other biomarker-driven strategies in this disease setting. Summary: Multiple trials are presently ongoing to assess novel immunotherapy and targeted therapy strategies to improve outcomes and decrease treatment-associated toxicities in patients with locally advanced NSCLC. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

More than half of these patients will also have an indication for treatment with radiotherapy. The effects of both radiotherapy and immune-checkpoint inhibition (ICI) involve a complex interplay with the innate and adaptive immune systems, and accumulating evidence suggests that, under certain circumstances, the effects of radiotherapy synergize with those of ICI to augment the antitumour responses typically observed with either modality alone and thus improve clinical outcomes. However, the mechanisms by which radiotherapy and immune-checkpoint inhibitors synergistically modulate the immune response might also affect both the type and severity of treatment-related toxicities. Moreover, in patients receiving immune-checkpoint inhibitors, the development of immune-related adverse events has been linked with superior treatment responses and patient survival durations, suggesting a relationship between the antitumour and adverse autoimmune effects of these agents. In this Review, we discuss the emerging data on toxicity profiles related to immune-checkpoint inhibitors and radiotherapy, both separately and in combination, their potential mechanisms, and the approaches to managing these toxicities. © 2018, Macmillan Publishers Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

However, following ICI therapy or TT - either alone (especially ICI) or in combination with radiotherapy - imaging findings on anatomical contrast-enhanced MRI can be unpredictable and highly variable, and are often difficult to interpret regarding treatment response and outcome. This review aims at summarizing the imaging challenges related to TT and ICI monotherapy as well as combined with radiotherapy in patients with brain metastases, and to give an overview on advanced imaging techniques which potentially overcome some of these imaging challenges. Currently, major evidence suggests that imaging parameters especially derived from amino acid PET, perfusion-/diffusion-weighted MRI, or MR spectroscopy may provide valuable additional information for the differentiation of treatment-induced changes from brain metastases recurrence and the evaluation of treatment response. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

	abstract = {Introduction: Non-small cell lung cancer and malignant pleural mesothelioma represent two of the most intriguing and scrutinized thoracic malignancies, presenting interesting perspectives of experimental development and clinical applications. Areas covered: In advanced non-small cell lung cancer, molecular targeted therapy is the standard first-line treatment for patients with identified driver mutations; on the other hand, chemotherapy is the standard treatment for patients without EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangement or those with unknown mutation status. Once considered an ineffective therapy in pulmonary neoplasms, immunotherapy has been now established as one of the most promising therapeutic options. Mesenchymal stromal cells are able to migrate specifically toward solid neoplasms and their metastatic localizations when injected intravenously. This peculiar cancer tropism has opened up an emerging field to use them as vectors to deliver antineoplastic drugs for targeted therapies. Expert opinion: Molecular targeted therapy and immunotherapy are the new alternatives to standard chemotherapy. Mesenchymal stromal cells are a new promising tool in oncology and—although not yet utilized in the clinical practice, we think they will represent another main tool for cancer therapy and will probably play a leading role in the field of nanovectors and molecular medicine. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

In a subsequent stage, immune checkpoint inhibitors were used in various clinical trials in combination with other therapeutic agents, such as immunomodulatory factors, chemotherapeutics, oncolytic viruses and radiation therapy. Interestingly, local antitumor interventions based either on radiation therapy or oncolytic viruses resulted in systemic immune responses in a number of oncological patients. The elimination of untreated cancer tissues that may follow a localized therapeutic intervention was termed abscopal effect, which represents a major achievement in the field of cancer therapy.

	abstract = {Background: Therapeutic strategies with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) counteract the immunosuppressive effects of programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) and ligand-1 (PD-L1). ICI treatment has emerged in first- and second-line therapy of non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). As immunotherapeutic treatment with ICIs is a dynamic field where new drugs and combinations are constantly evaluated, we conducted an up-to-date systematic review on comparative efficacy and safety in patients with advanced NSCLC. Methods: We searched PubMed up to February 2020 and Embase, CENTRAL, and clinical trial registries up to August 2018. Additionally, we checked reference lists. We dually screened titles, abstracts and, subsequently, full-texts for eligibility. Two reviewers assessed the risk of bias and graded the certainty of evidence following GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation). For second-line therapy, we performed random-effects meta-analyses. Due to considerable clinical heterogeneity, we reported first-line results narratively. Results: Of 1497 references, we identified 22 relevant publications of 16 studies. For first-line therapy, a combination of an ICI with chemotherapy improved progression-free survival and overall survival compared to chemotherapy but increased the risk of serious adverse events. Single-agent pembrolizumab increased overall and progression-free survival in patients with PD-L1 expression of ≥50% and resulted in less TRAE than chemotherapy. Compared to placebo, maintenance therapy with durvalumab increased overall and progression-free survival at the downside of higher risk of TRAE. For second-line therapy, a random-effects meta-analysis yielded a statistically significantly improved overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) for ICIs compared to docetaxel (HR 0.69; 95% CI: 0.63–0.75 for OS; HR 0.85; 95% CI: 0.77 − 0.93 for PFS; 6 studies, 3478 patients; median OS benefit in months: 2.4 to 4.2). In meta-analysis, risk of any treatment-related adverse events of any grade was lower for ICI than docetaxel as second-line therapy (RR 0.76, 95% CI: 0.73–0.79; 6 studies, 3763 patients). Conclusion: In first-line therapy of patients with advanced NSCLC, ICI is effective when combined with chemotherapy not depending on PD-L1 expression, or as monotherapy in high PD-L1 expressing tumors. For second-line therapy, single-agent ICI improves efficacy and safety compared to docetaxel. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s). Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {The development of immunotherapy with checkpoints inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer has been conducted at an unprecedented scale, leading to a vast number of pivotal phase III trials which results have overturned the treatment algorithms for metastatic and locally advanced diseases. After establishing a new standard of care with anti-PD(L)-1 as single agents in second-line setting, the results of phase III trials are favouring their use in frontline setting, either as single agent for pembrolizumab when there is a high level of PD-L1 expression in tumour cells, or in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy. The room for combination of anti-CTLA-4 with anti-PD(L)-1 still remains difficult to assess but might be especially active in case of a high tumour mutational burden. The addition of durvalumab after concurrent chemoradiation therapy in locally advanced disease has also improved progression-free survival, translating into a survival benefit with an actually unknown magnitude. Anti-PD(L)-1 have been also developed in small-cell lung cancer, leading to a possible change in the treatment algorithm for extensive stage with the addition of atezolizumab to first-line chemotherapy. The next step will need to better know the mechanisms of primary and acquired resistance to immunotherapy and to identify additional biomarkers as tumour mutational burden in order to more tailor the treatment sequences to each given patient. © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.},

Given the broad antitumor efficacy and novel mechanism of action, numerous combinatorial approaches incorporating PD-1/PD-L1 blockade have been suggested; herein we present a comprehensive analysis of these clinical trials. We queried clinicaltrials.gov for all PD-1/PD-L1 mAbs administered for cancer therapy with an end date of 4/30/2017. A total of 1,218 clinical trials met our search criteria. These trials have a planned enrollment of 227,190 patients, and approximately half (493) were initiated in 2016 alone. Of these over 1,200 trials, 916 combine PD-1/PD-L1 blockade with at least one additional therapy, ranging from traditional treatment modalities like surgery and chemoradiation to newer therapies like small molecule inhibitors and other immunotherapies. The staggering proliferation of clinical trials combining PD-1/PD-L1 blockade with disparate treatments necessitates careful accounting to maximize efficiency and highlight areas of unmet needs. We believe our analysis provides this data and expect it will facilitate the design of future clinical trials in this burgeoning area of oncology research. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {Importance: Non-small cell lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Until the last decade, the 5-year overall survival rate for patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer was less than 5%. Improved understanding of the biology of lung cancer has resulted in the development of new biomarker-targeted therapies and led to improvements in overall survival for patients with advanced or metastatic disease. Observations: Systemic therapy for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer is selected according to the presence of specific biomarkers. Therefore, all patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer should undergo molecular testing for relevant mutations and expression of the protein PD-L1 (programmed death ligand 1). Molecular alterations that predict response to treatment (eg, EGFR mutations, ALK rearrangements, ROS1 rearrangements, and BRAF V600E mutations) are present in approximately 30% of patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Targeted therapy for these alterations improves progression-free survival compared with cytotoxic chemotherapy. For example, somatic activating mutations in the EGFR gene are present in approximately 20% of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as gefitinib, erlotinib, and afatinib improve progression-free survival in patients with susceptible EGFR mutations. In patients with overexpression of ALK protein, the response rate was significantly better with crizotinib (a tyrosine kinase inhibitor) than with the combination of pemetrexed and either cisplatin or carboplatin (platinum-based chemotherapy) (74% vs 45%, respectively; P <.001) and progression-free survival (median, 10.9 months vs 7.0 months; P <.001). Subsequent generations of tyrosine kinase inhibitors have improved these agents. For patients without biomarkers indicating susceptibility to specific targeted treatments, immune checkpoint inhibitor-containing regimens either as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy are superior vs chemotherapy alone. These advances in biomarker-directed therapy have led to improvements in overall survival. For example, the 5-year overall survival rate currently exceeds 25% among patients whose tumors have high PD-L1 expression (tumor proportion score of ≥50%) and 40% among patients with ALK-positive tumors. Conclusions and Relevance: Improved understanding of the biology and molecular subtypes of non-small cell lung cancer have led to more biomarker-directed therapies for patients with metastatic disease. These biomarker-directed therapies and newer empirical treatment regimens have improved overall survival for patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.. © 2019 American Medical Association.

Despite treatment with curative intent, most patients subsequently relapse and develop distant disease. Treatment with checkpoint inhibitors represents a major advancement in the treatment of metastatic NSCLC. Therapy against programed cell death-1/programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) is associated with a significant improvement in overall survival in stage IV disease, and these results have led to a great interest in evaluating these agents in earlier-stage NSCLC. The preliminary data from ongoing trials suggest that the integration of checkpoint blockage into the treatment of early-stage and locally advanced NSCLC is safe, tolerable, and has the potential to improve outcomes without adding substantial toxicity. In the current review, we provide an overview of the emerging data on the role of PD-1/PD-L1 and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) inhibitors in the treatment of early-stage and locally advanced NSCLC, with a focus on ongoing clinical trials and combination strategies. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

Recently, a novel therapeutic approach based on targeting the immune-checkpoints has showed noteworthy results in advanced NSCLC. PD1/PD-L1 pathway is co-opted by tumor cells through the expression of PD-L1 on the tumor cell surface and on cells within the microenvironment, leading to suppression of anti-tumor cytolytic T-cell activity by the tumor. The success of immune-checkpoints inhibitors in clinical trials led to rapid approval by the FDA and EMA. Currently, data regarding efficacy and safety of ICIs in older subjects is limited by the poor number of elderly recruited in clinical trials. Careful assessment and management of comorbidities is essential to achieve better outcomes and limit the immune related adverse events in elderly NSCLC patients. © 2019 by the authors.

	abstract = {Despite that the impact of immune checkpoint inhibitors on malignancies treatment is unprecedented, a lack of response to these molecules is observed in several cases. Differently from melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer, where the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors results in a high efficacy, the response rate in other tumors, such as gastrointestinal cancers, breast cancer, sarcomas, and part of genitourinary cancers remains low. The first strategy evaluated to improve the response rate to immune checkpoint inhibitors is the use of predictive factors for the response such as PD-L1 expression, tumor mutational burden, and clinical features. In addition to the identification of the patients with a higher expression of immune checkpoint molecules, another approach currently under intensive investigation is the use of therapeutics in a combinatory manner with immune checkpoint inhibitors in order to obtain an enhancement of efficacy through the modification of the tumor immune microenvironment. In addition to the abscopal effect induced by radiotherapy, a lot of studies are evaluating several drugs able to improve the response rate to immune checkpoint inhibitors, including microbiota modifiers, drugs targeting co-inhibitory receptors, anti-angiogenic therapeutics, small molecules, and oncolytic viruses. In view of the rapid and extensive development of this research field, we conducted a systematic review of the literature identifying which of these drugs are closer to achieving validation in the clinical practice. © 2019 by the authors.

New promising therapies have emerged based on programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) immunity checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), including anti-PD-1, such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab, or programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors, such as atezolizumab, durvalumab, and avelumab. The prescription of pembrolizumab has been approved by FDA and EMA for advanced stages non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), restricted for first-line setting to patients whose tumor presents ≥50% of PD-L1 positive tumor cells (TC), and ≥1% for second-line and beyond, leading to consider PD-L1 assay as a companion diagnostic tool for pembrolizumab. Very recently, the EMA has approved durvalumab for the treatment of patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC not progressing after chemoradiotherapy and whose tumors express PD-L1 on ≥1% of TC. Four standardized PD-L1 immunohistochemistry assays have been used in clinical trials; 22C3 and 28-8 PharmDx assays on Dako/Agilent platforms, and SP142 and SP263 assays on Ventana platforms, each test having been developed initially for a specific ICI. They differ in terms of primary monoclonal antibody, platform, detection system and scoring methods with different thresholds of positivity validated in clinical trials. Several studies have shown a close analytical performance of the 22C3, 28-8 and SP263 assays regarding TC staining in NSCLC, with poor concordance with SP142 assay and for immune cells. However, as dedicated platforms are not available in all pathology laboratories and because of the high cost of these assays, laboratory developed tests are widely used in many countries. Their validation must guarantee the same sensitivities and specificities as compared to standardized assays. Overall, PD-L1 test is of great help to select patients who could benefit for ICI and most pathologists have included this test in their daily practice for advanced stages NSCLC, besides ALK and ROS1 IHC. © Journal of Thoracic Disease.

Most oncology trials involving immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIPs) have routinely excluded patients with HIV infection and chronic viral hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) due to concerns about viral reactivation, fears of increased toxicity, and the potential lack of efficacy in these patient subgroups. However, with current antiviral therapies, HIV and HBV infections have become chronic diseases and HCV infections can even be cured. Broadening cancer trial eligibility criteria in order to include cancer patients with chronic viral infections can maximize the ecological validity of study results and the ability to understand the ICPIs’ benefit-risk profile in patients with these comorbidities. In this review, we examined the evidence on the efficacy and safety of using ICPIs in cancer patients with concurrent chronic viral infections. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive disease with distinct pathological, clinical, and molecular characteristics from non–small-cell lung cancer. SCLC has high metastatic potential, resulting in a clinically poor prognosis. Early concurrent chemo-radiation is the standard of care for limited-stage SCLC (LS-SCLC). Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) is recommended for patients with LS-SCLC without progression of disease after initial therapy. A combination of etoposide and cisplatin or carboplatin remains the mainstay of first-line treatment for ES-SCLC, with the addition of atezolizumab, now becoming standard. Most SCLCs initially respond to therapy but almost invariably recur. Topotecan and amrubicin (in Japan) remain the primary chemotherapy options for relapsed SCLC. Immunotherapy, including nivolumab with or without ipilimumab, is now available for refractory disease. In general, the poor prognosis of SCLC has not improved significantly for more than 3 decades. Recently, next-generation molecular profiling studies have identified new therapeutic targets for SCLC. A variety of proapoptotic agents, compounds capitalizing on DNA-repair defects, immunotherapy agents, and antibody–drug conjugates are being evaluated in SCLC, with a number of them showing early promise. © 2019 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research},

Data are presented relating to chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and targeted therapy in the advanced setting. Expert opinion: Elderly patients particularly benefit from advances in systemic therapy. Based on the tumor profile, treatment with targeted therapy or immunotherapy should be favored over chemotherapy where possible in the elderly population. Elderly patients benefit from EGFR, ALK, and ROS-1 inhibition in the setting of these tumor alterations. These agents should be utilized early in the treatment course. Across many studies, the benefit from immunotherapy is seen irrespective of age. Favorable outcomes and toxicity profiles from immunotherapy compared to chemotherapy are well described. Chemotherapy should be offered with caution after a detailed assessment. Options include combination or single-agent chemotherapy regimens.

	abstract = {Background: The standard treatment for patients with unresectable locally advanced (LA) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Consolidation therapy with durvalumab after CRT demonstrated survival benefits and was approved in Japan in July 2018. The use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) is entering routine oncological practice, and here we investigate the feasibility of concurrent CRT for LA-NSCLC patients based on the PACIFIC criteria. Methods: We performed a retrospective study to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of concurrent CRT prior to the approval of durvalumab. We assessed consecutive patients with LA-NSCLC treated with CRT between January 2012 and June 2018. Results: We analyzed a total of 108 consecutive patients who received radical thoracic radiotherapy and concurrent platinum-based chemotherapy. Of those patients, 105 (97%) completed the planned radiotherapy. Radiation pneumonitis was observed in 93 patients (85%), with a median of 130 days (range: 41–317 days) from the initiation of radiation to the onset of the complication. Among the patients, 74 (69%) were considered eligible for consolidation therapy with durvalumab. The overall response rate was 64%, and the two-year survival rate was 63%. Patients who received an ICI after relapse were associated with significantly better survival than those who did not receive an ICI (two-year survival rate: 87% vs. 41%, respectively; P = 0.001). Conclusions: Prior to the approval of durvalumab, the clinical application of ICIs improved the outcome of patients with relapsed NSCLC after CRT for LA-NSCLC. The management of radiation pneumonitis remains a challenge following the approval of durvalumab. © 2020 The Authors.

Prognosis is poor: even with the current gold-standard first-line treatment - maximal safe resection and combination of radiotherapy with temozolomide chemotherapy - the median overall survival time is only approximately 15-17 months, because the tumour recurs in virtually all patients, and no commonly accepted standard treatment for recurrent disease exists. Several targeted agents have failed to improve patient outcomes in glioblastoma. Immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors such as ipilimumab, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab has provided relevant clinical improvements in other advanced tumours for which conventional therapies have had limited success, making immunotherapy an appealing strategy in glioblastoma. This Review summarizes current knowledge on immune checkpoint modulators and evaluates their potential role in glioblastoma on the basis of preclinical studies and emerging clinical data. Furthermore, we discuss challenges that need to be considered in the clinical development of drugs that target immune checkpoint pathways in glioblastoma, such as specific properties of the immune system in the CNS, issues with radiological response assessment, and potential interactions with established and emerging treatment strategies. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), designed to directly target immune inhibitory molecules, have demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC. Areas covered: In the present article, the authors summarize the mechanism, efficacy and safety of major ICIs for the treatment of advanced or metastatic NSCLC. Combinations of different ICIs or conventional therapy and/or targeted agents for NSCLC treatment in clinical trials are also updated. In addition, immune-related adverse events and the roles of inhibitory immune checkpoint molecules as potential biomarkers in the immune checkpoint blockade therapy for NSCLC are emphatically elucidated. Expert opinion: Immunotherapies targeting the immune checkpoint pathways have shown potential to generate durable responses and improve survival for NSCLC patients. Although the toxicity profile of this immunotherapy is manageable, immune-related adverse events and drug resistance may cause therapeutic failure. Therefore, a better understanding of the mechanisms underpinning its function and the potential side effects of ICIs, as well as the identification of predictive biomarkers for patient selection are essential. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the main pathological type of lung cancer, and most newly diagnosed NSCLC patients cannot undergo surgery because the disease is already locally advanced or metastatic. Despite chemoradiotherapy and targeted therapy improving clinical outcomes, overall survival remains poor. Immune checkpoint blockade, especially blockade of programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor and its ligand PD-L1, achieved robust responses and improved survival for patients with locally advanced/metastatic NSCLC in preclinical and clinical studies. However, with regard to PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint blockade as monotherapy or in combination with other antitumor therapies, such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy (including conventional irradiation and stereotactic body radiotherapy), and target therapy, there are still many unknowns in treating patients with NSCLC. Despite this limited understanding, checkpoint blockade as a novel therapeutic approach may change the treatment paradigm of NSCLC in the future. Here we review the main results from completed and ongoing studies to investigate the feasibility of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, as monotherapy or combinatorial agents in patients with locally advanced and metastatic NSCLC, and explore optimal strategy in such patients. © 2016 Jing et al.},

Methods: Patients received immune-checkpoint inhibitors (pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, nivolumab, and durvalumab plus tremelimumab) to treat metastatic or recurrent NSCLC after failed platinum-based chemotherapy. Tumor response was assessed according to both RECIST v1.1 and irRC. Results: Responses by 41 patients were analyzed. The overall response rate (ORR) was 29.2% (95% CI 17.6–44.5) assessed by RECIST v1.1 and 34.1% (95% CI 21.6–49.4) by irRC, showing similar results from the two methods (p = 0.923). Two patients (4.9%) were defined as having progressive disease as assessed by RECIST but not by irRC. The patients eventually experienced tumor regression, suggesting delayed pseudoprogression. For all patients, the median PFS was 5.1 months (95% CI 3.4–6.7) and OS was 18.3 months (95% CI 6.7–29.8). In multivariate analysis, ex- or current smokers (HR 0.34, p = 0.14) and EGFR mutation negativity (HR 0.16, p = 0.05) were associated with significantly longer PFS. Conclusion: Our study found that pseudoprogression was not frequently observed in NSCLC. Conventional RECIST v1.1 might underestimate the benefit of immune-checkpoint inhibitors. Given the small number of patients studied, further study is warranted on whether treatment with immune-checkpoint inhibitors beyond RECIST progression benefits patients with advanced NSCLC. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.},

Nevertheless, because of the failure of conventional anti-cancer treatments to achieve sustained control of intracranial neoplasms, immunotherapy has been considered as a promising strategy for decades. However, several efforts aimed at exploiting the immune system as a therapeutic weapon were largely unsuccessful. The situation only changed with the introduction of the checkpoint inhibitors, which target immune cell receptors that interfere with the activation of immune effector cells. Following the observation of striking effects of drugs that target CTLA-4 or PD-1 against melanoma and other tumor entities, it was recognized that these drugs may also be active against metastatic tumor lesions in the brain. Their therapeutic activity against primary brain tumors is currently being investigated within clinical trials. In parallel, other immunotherapeutics such as peptide vaccines are at an advanced stage of clinical development. Further immunotherapeutic strategies currently under investigation comprise adoptive immune cell transfer as well as inhibitors of metabolic pathways involved in the local immunosuppression frequently found in brain tumors. Thus, the ongoing implementation of immunotherapeutic concepts into clinical routine may represent a powerful addition to the therapeutic arsenal against various brain tumors. © 2016 S.

	abstract = {The treatment of bladder cancer has evolved over time to encompass not only the traditional modalities of chemotherapy and surgery, but has been particularly impacted by the use of immunotherapy. The first immunotherapy was the live, attenuated bacterial Bacillus Calmette–Guérin vaccine, which has been the standard of care non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer since 1990. Modern immunotherapy has focused on inhibitors of checkpoint proteins, which are molecules that impede immune function, thereby allowing tumor cells to grow and proliferate unregulated. Several checkpoint targets (programmed death ligand-1 [PD-L1] programmed cell death protien-1 [PD-1], and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 [CTLA4]) have received the most attention in the treatment of bladder cancer, and have inhibitor agents either approved or in late-stage development. This review describes the most recent data on agents that inhibit PD-L1, found on the surface of tumor cells, and PD-1 found on activated T and B cells and macrophages. Atezolizumab is the only member of this class currently approved for the treatment of bladder cancer, but nivolumab, pembrolizumab, durvalumab, and avelumab all have positive results for this indication, and approvals are anticipated in the near future. The checkpoint inhibitors offer an effective alternative for patients for whom previously there were few options for durable responses, including those who are ineligible for cisplatin-based regimens or who are at risk of significant toxicity. Research is ongoing to further categorize responses, define ideal patient populations, and investigate combinations of checkpoint inhibitors to address multiple pathways in immune system functioning. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Cancer treatment has been revolutionized by the advent of new molecular targeted and immunotherapeutic agents. Identification of the role of tumor angiogenesis changed the understanding of many tumors. After the unsuccessful results with chemotherapy, sorafenib, by interfering with angiogenic pathways, has become pivotal in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. Sorafenib is the only systemic treatment to show a modest but statistically significant survival benefit. All novel drugs and strategies for treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma must be compared with the results obtained with sorafenib, but no new drug or drug combination has yet achieved better results. In our opinion, the efforts to impact the natural history of the disease will be directed not only to drug development but also to understanding the underlying liver disease (usually hepatitis B virus- or hepatitis C virus-related) and to interrupting the progression of cirrhosis. It will be important to define the role and amount of mutations in the complex pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma and to better integrate locoregional and systemic therapies. It will be important also to optimize the therapeutic strategies with existing chemotherapeutic drugs and new targeted agents. © The Author(s) 2016. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

	abstract = {Lung cancer is the deadliest malignancy with more cancer deaths per year than the next three cancers combined. Despite remarkable advances in targeted therapy, advanced lung cancer patients have not experienced a significant improvement in mortality. Lung cancer has been shown to be immunogenic and responsive to checkpoint blockade therapy. Checkpoint signals such as CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1 dampen T cell activation and allow tumors to escape the adaptive immune response. Response rates in patients with pretreated, advanced NSCLC were much higher and more durable with PD-1 blockade therapy compared to standard-of-care, cytotoxic chemotherapy. Therefore, PD-1 inhibitors such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab were rapidly approved for both squamous and nonsquamous lung cancer in the pretreated population. The advent of these new therapies have revolutionized the treatment of lung cancer; however, the majority of NSCLC patients still do not respond to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition leaving an unmet need for a large and growing population. Immunotherapy combinations with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or novel immunomodulatory agents are currently being examined with the hope of achieving higher response rates and improving overall survival rate. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy has been theorized to increase the release of tumor antigen leading to increased responses with immunotherapy. However, cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation therapy may also destroy actively proliferating T cells. The correct combination and order of therapy is under investigation. The majority of patients who do respond to immunotherapy have a durable response attributed to the effect of adaptive immune system's memory. Unfortunately, some patients' tumors do progress afterward and investigation of checkpoint blockade resistance is still nascent. This review will summarize the latest efficacy and safety data for early and advanced NSCLC in both the treatment-naïve and pretreated settings. The emerging role of immunotherapy for the treatment of small cell lung cancer and malignant mesothelioma will also be discussed. © 2017 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The treatment of cancer has largely relied on killing tumor cells with nonspecific cytotoxic therapies and radiotherapy. This approach, however, has limitations including severe systemic toxicities, bystander effects on normal cells, recurrence of drug-resistant tumor cells, and the inability to target micrometastases or subclinical disease. An increased understanding of the critical role of the immune system in cancer development and progression has led to new treatment strategies using various immunotherapies. It is now recognized that established tumors have numerous mechanisms of suppressing the antitumor immune response including production of inhibitory cytokines, recruitment of immunosuppressive immune cells, and upregulation of coinhibitory receptors known as immune checkpoints. This review focuses on the immune checkpoint inhibitors, a novel class of immunotherapy first approved in 2011. Our objective is to highlight similarities and differences among the three immune checkpoint inhibitors approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration - ipilimumab, pembrolizumab, and nivolumab - to facilitate therapeutic decision making. We conducted a review of the published literature and conference proceedings and present a critical appraisal of the clinical evidence supporting their use in the treatment of metastatic melanoma and advanced squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We also compare and contrast their current place in cancer therapy and patterns of immune-related toxicities, and discuss the role of dual immune checkpoint inhibition and strategies for the management of immune-related adverse events. The immune checkpoint inhibitors have demonstrated a dramatic improvement in overall survival in patients with advanced melanoma and squamous NSCLC, along with acceptable toxicity profiles. These agents have a clear role in the first-line treatment of advanced melanoma and in the second-line treatment of advanced squamous NSCLC. © 2015 Pharmacotherapy Publications, Inc.},

While ipilimumab has been approved as a CTLA-4 blocking antibody by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of advanced melanoma, it is still not approved for lung cancer treatment. In contrast, nivolumab and pembrolizumab, both PD-1 blocking antibodies, have been approved for second-line treatment of nonsmall cell lung cancer in 2015 because of their high potency and long-lasting effects in some patient subgroups. Other PD-1 and PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies are also in active development phase. Treatment with such immune checkpoint inhibitors is associated with a unique pattern of immune-related adverse events or side effects. Combination approaches involving CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1 blockade or checkpoint inhibitors with chemotherapy or radiotherapy are being investigated to determine whether they may enhance the efficacy of treatment.

Immunotherapy is emerging as a major modality in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treatment focusing on vaccine approaches to elicit specific immune responses and development of inhibitors of the molecular mediators of cancer-induced immunosuppression (immune checkpoints) to boost antitumor immune responses. Amplification of the host response against evolving tumors through vaccination is being investigated in ongoing clinical trials with tumor cell vaccines; however, the clinical efficacy of these agents has been limited. Blocking inhibitory pathways such as the CTL antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) checkpoint pathways with mAbs has generated antitumor immune responses that are transforming cancer therapeutics.

Yet, even in this era of precision medicine and exciting advances, cytotoxic chemotherapies remain an essential component of lung cancer treatment. In the setting of locoregional disease, chemotherapy is the only systemic therapy thus far proven to enhance curability when combined with surgery or radiation. In the metastatic setting, chemotherapy can improve the length and quality of life in many patients. Chemotherapy remains the mainstay of care for individuals whose cancers with oncogenic drivers have acquired resistance to targeted agents. Chemotherapy also has the potential to modulate the immune system to enhance the effectiveness of immune checkpoint inhibitors. In this context, chemotherapy should be framed as a critical component of the armamentarium available for optimizing cancer care rather than an unfortunate anachronism.

Antibodies and fusion proteins, capable of blocking and/or activating these co-signaling pathways, are emerging as potent therapeutic options for the treatment of cancer and autoimmune disease. Blockade of one such pair of co signaling interactions, termed PD-L1:PD-1, has shown tremendous promise in phase I treatment trials for advanced solid tumors like non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma, with long term disease remission in select patients. Based on intriguing preclinical data from our group and others, several trials are actively evaluating the utility of PD-L1:PD-1 blockade for the treatment of recurrent/metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). In this review we will explore what is known about the interactions between PD-1 and PD-L1, with a focus on SCCHN, and specifically discuss how this pathway can be manipulated with therapeutic intent. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Background: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths, having caused an estimated 1.6 million deaths worldwide in 2012 [Ferlay J, Soerjomataram I, Dikshit R et al. Cancer incidence and mortality worldwide: sources, methods and major patterns in GLOBOCAN 2012. Int J Cancer 2015; 136: E359-E386]. Materials and methods: Although the majority of patients are not cured with currently available therapies, there have been significant improvements in stage-specific outcomes over time [Videtic G, Vokes E, Turrisi A et al. The survival of patients treated for stage III non-small cell lung cancer in North America has increased during the past 25 years. In The 39th Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, ASCO 2003, Chicago, IL. Abstract 2557. p. 291]. This review focuses on past progress and ongoing research in the treatment of locally advanced, inoperable nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Results: In the past, randomized trials revealed advantages to the use of thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) and then, the addition of induction chemotherapy. This was followed by studies that determined concurrent chemoradiotherapy to be superior to sequential therapy. A recent large phase III trial found that the administration of 74 Gy of conventionally fractionated photon-based TRT provided poorer survival than did the standard 60 Gy. However, further research on other methods of applying radiotherapy (hypofractionation, adaptive TRT, proton therapy, and stereotactic TRT boosting) is proceeding and may improve outcomes. The molecular characterization of tumors has provided more effective and less toxic targeted treatments in the stage IV setting and these agents are currently under investigation for earlier stage disease. Similarly, immune-enhancing therapies have shown promise in stage IV disease and are also being tested in the locally advanced setting. Conclusion: For locally advanced, inoperable NSCLC, standard therapy has evolved from TRT alone to combined modality therapy. We summarize the recent clinical trial experience and outline promising areas of investigation in an era of greater molecular and immunologic understanding of cancer care. © The Author 2015.},

	abstract = {The era of immunotherapy has changed the face of how we approach treatment for many oncologic and hematologic malignancies. Lung cancer has been in the forefront of checkpoint inhibition for the past 2 years and has paved the path for other subspecialties. While PD-1 inhibitors nivolumab and pembrolizumab have been approved for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), this review focuses on atezolizumab, its landmark studies, and ongoing trials. Atezolizumab is the first programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor to receive US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for metastatic NSCLC patients who have progressed on frontline chemotherapy. This approval was based on two open-label Phase II multicenter trials, POPLAR (NCT01903993) and BIRCH (NCT02031458). Both studies revealed a benefit in overall survival (OS), progression-free survival, and response rate in the atezolizumab arm when compared to single-agent docetaxol. There were also fewest Grade 3–5 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) in the atezolizumab cohort. The open-label randomized Phase III OAK trial (NCT02008227) further established the role of atezolizumab in previously treated NSCLC. This study compared atezolizumab with docetaxel in patients with advanced NSCLC (squamous or nonsquamous histologies) who had progressed on one to two prior chemotherapy regimens. OS in the PD-L1-enriched population was superior in the atezolizumab arm (n=241) at 15.7 months compared with docetaxel (n=222) at 10.3 months (hazard ratio [HR] 0.74, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.58–0.93; p=0.0102). Patients lacking PD-L1 also had survival benefit with atezolizumab with a median OS (mOS) of 12.6 months versus 8.9 months with chemotherapy (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.59–0.96). Benefit was noted in both squamous and nonsquamous NSCLC subsets and regardless of PD-L1 expressivity. As seen in the POPLAR and BIRCH studies, the toxicity profile was significantly better with immunotherapy. The future is unfolding rapidly as new checkpoint inhibitors are gaining FDA approval. It is still not known if these agents will be used in combination with chemotherapy, with other immune-modulating agents, radiation therapy, or all of the above. The results of these studies investigating their use in combination with chemotherapy agents, with other immunotherapy agents such as CTLA-4 inhibitors, and with radiation therapy, are eagerly awaited. © 2017 Seetharamu et al.},

	abstract = {Lung cancer is the major cause for cancer-related death in the US. Although advances in chemotherapy and targeted therapy have improved the outcome of metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer, its prognosis remains dismal. A deeper understanding of the complex interaction between the immune system and tumor microenvironment has identified immune checkpoint inhibitors as new avenue of immunotherapy. Rather than acting directly on the tumor, these therapies work by removing the inhibition exerted by tumor cell or other immune cells on the immune system, promoting antitumoral immune response. To date, two programmed death-1 inhibitors, namely nivolumab and pembrolizumab, have received the US Food and Drug Administration approval for the treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer that failed platinum-based chemotherapy. This manuscript provides a brief overview of the pathophysiology of cancer immune evasion, summarizes pertinent data on completed and ongoing clinical trials involving checkpoint inhibitors, discusses the different strategies to optimize their function, and outlines various challenges that are faced in this promising yet evolving field. © 2016 El-Osta et al.},

	abstract = {Several factors must be considered to successfully integrate immunotherapy with radiation into clinical practice. One such factor is that concepts arising from preclinical work must be tested in combination with radiation in preclinical models to better understand how combination therapy will work in patients; examples include checkpoint inhibitors, tumor growth factor-beta (TGF-β) inhibitors, and natural killer (NK) cell therapy. Also, many radiation fields and fractionation schedules typically used in radiation therapy had been standardized before the introduction of advanced techniques for radiation planning and delivery that account for changes in tumor size, location, and motion during treatment, as well as uncertainties introduced by variations in patient setup between treatment fractions. As a result, radiation therapy may involve the use of large treatment volumes, often encompassing nodal regions that may not be irradiated with more conformal techniques. Traditional forms of radiation in particular pose challenges for combination trials with immunotherapy. This chapter explores these issues in more detail and provides insights as to how radiation therapy can be optimized to combine with immunotherapy. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

Additionally, we discuss how circulating tumor DNA can be assayed to safely monitor breast cancer over the course of treatment, and report on how therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors is proving effective in advanced lung cancer. Finally, we summarize efforts to use molecular profiling of prostate cancer biopsy specimens to support treatment decisions.

	abstract = {The last decade has witnessed rapid advances in the discovery and development of immune checkpoint inhibitors in cancer medicine, particularly drugs targeting programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) in non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The proven antitumor efficacy coupled with low rates of drug-related toxicities observed, albeit idiosyncratic, with these novel immunotherapeutics have led to the registration of multiple PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors, such as nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and atezolizumab, in second-line advanced NSCLC, whereas durvalumab and avelumab are in late-phase clinical testing. Moreover, pembrolizumab has shown a survival advantage in the first-line setting; however, nivolumab failed to show a survival benefit possibly relating to patient selection based on PD-L1 expression. Current patient selection is based on PD-L1 expression, using the relevant companion diagnostic test, where patients with strong PD-L1 expression being more likely to respond to these novel agents. Ongoing clinical research focuses on the development of PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitor monotherapy in neoadjuvant and adjuvant NSCLC. There is also much interest in using these drugs as a therapeutic backbone for rational combinations with other treatment modalities including cytotoxic chemotherapies in the first-line NSCLC, other immunotherapies such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte–associated protein 4 antagonists, molecularly targeted agents including EGFR and ALK inhibitors, and radiotherapy. Concurrent treatment with radiotherapy is of particular interest owing to the potential for the abscopal effect, using radiotherapy to facilitate systemic treatment. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for more than 85% of all lung cancers. Platinum-based doublet chemotherapy is the standard first-line treatment for metastatic NSCLC when genomic testing reveals no targetable alteration such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) or ROS1 translocation/re-arrangements. But, chemotherapy produces response rates ranging only between 15-30%. For patients whose disease progresses on first-line chemotherapy, second-line therapy historically consists of taxane-based salvage chemotherapy with a response rate of less than 25%. Recently, immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitor agents have demonstrated responses in advanced NSCLC, with some patients exhibiting durable responses after discontinuing therapy. In 2015, two immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting programmed cell death-1 (PD-1), nivolumab and pembrolizumab were approved for second-line therapy of NSCLC. In 2016, another checkpoint inhibitor targeting program death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), atezolizumab was approved for the same indication. Moreover, pembrolizumab also received approval in 2016 for first-line NSCLC treatment in patients with high PD-L1 expressing tumors. Immunotherapy for NSCLC has therefore, recently evolved into a true treatment modality with the acceptance of PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors as the new standard of care for second-line treatment. However, it is still at the discretion of the treating physician whether to use PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor as data to compare these two pathways is lacking. Focus is now also on exploring their role in the adjuvant and consolidation settings for NSCLC as well as on exploring novel combinations combining these agents with chemotherapy or radiation. Research is also needed in the development of predictive and prognostic biomarkers for these agents. While vaccine therapy trials in NSCLC have so far failed to show significant clinical benefit, the demonstration of enhanced immune response in these trials suggest the vaccine therapy needs additional evaluation in combination with other therapeutic modalities especially checkpoint inhibition. © Translational lung cancer research.

	abstract = {Lung cancer is the main reason of cancer death worldwide. About 30% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cases are diagnosed with locally advanced disease (stage III). This is a mixed population including patients who have far more extensive and bulky disease than others. Management of these patients continue to be a challenge; frequently, patients have both local recurrence and distant metastases in this stage and the prognosis is very poor with a 5-year overall survival estimated between 3% and 7% for inoperable disease. The standard treatment for these patients is concurrent chemo-radiotherapy (CRT) improving survival when compared to sequential combination as shown in several metanalysis. Recently, immune-therapies, including checkpoint inhibitor, such as monoclonal antibodies against programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1) and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), have shown to enhance survival compared to chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC. The integration of radiotherapy with immunotherapy is a conceptually promising strategy and several preclinical experiments have further developed the rationale for combining them. Radiotherapy has the capacity to overcome a lot of tumor immune escape mechanisms through the liberation of immunogenic private antigens showing a better local control and augmenting the immune response of systemic agents.

	abstract = {Preliminary clinical studies of anti-programmed cell death-1 (anti-PD-1) therapy in gastroesophageal cancers have suggested promising single-agent activity. In patients who received prior treatment for advanced disease, pembrolizumab has been associated with a response rate of 20% in programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1)-positive tumors, and nivolumab with a response rate of 12% in unselected tumors. Both agents yielded a median duration of response lasting ~6-7 months. PD-L1 expression and microsatellite instability (MSI) have emerged as potential predictive markers for PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. PD-L1 expression in tumor cells and in immune cells within the tumor microenvironment has been detected in 14-24% and ~35% of patients with gastro-esophageal cancer, respectively. PD-L1 tumor cell expression appears to be more common in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive gastric cancers (GCs) and has been associated with an increased density of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL). To date, data are too sparse to determine whether PD-L1 expression predicts efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy in gastro-esophageal cancer, but data from other tumor types have not been consistent regarding its predictive value. MSI occurs in 10-20% of gastro-esophageal cancers and arises from deficient mismatch repair (MMR). MSI is highly correlated with non-synonymous mutation burden, as well as a dense accumulation of TILs. MSI has been associated with improved response to anti-PD-1 therapy in gastrointestinal cancers. Multiple studies are ongoing which examine therapeutic blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis in unselected patients with gastro-esophageal cancer, as well as patients whose tumors express PD-L1 or exhibit MSI. These studies will clarify their activity in this disease and potentially can determine whether identify a strong predictive biomarker can be identified. Checkpoint inhibition is also being studied in combination with curative-intent chemo (radio) therapy and surgery. © Journal of Gastrointestinal Oncology. All rights reserved.},
