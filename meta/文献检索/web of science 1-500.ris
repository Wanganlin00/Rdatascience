TI  - Treatment of unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer for patients who are under-represented in clinical trials
T2  - CANCER TREATMENT REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (cCRT) followed by one year of consolidation durvalumab is the current standard-of-care for patients with unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), of good functional status. However, cCRT and consolidation durvalumab may be challenging to administer for selected patient populations underrepresented or even excluded in clinical trials: older and/or frail patients; those with cardiovascular or respiratory comorbidities in which treatment-related adverse events may be higher, and patients with pre-existing autoimmune disorders for whom immunotherapy use is controversial. In this narrative review, we discuss the current evidence, challenges, ongoing clinical trials and potential future treatment scenarios in relevant subgroups of patients with locally advanced NSCLC, who are underrepresented in clinical trials.

TI  - Medical treatment of small cell lung cancer: Can we leave the area of cisplatinetoposide?
T2  - BULLETIN DU CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - Small cell lung cancer accounts for 14% of all lung cancers. It remains a major challenge for oncology as the progresses made in the past three decades are modest. After a rapid overview of current knowledge regarding somatic genomic alterations, this state-of-art addresses pathways to improve small-cell lung cancer outcome such as the targeting of DNA damage repair mechanisms firstly anti-PARPs, inhibitory molecules of EZH2, derepression of the NOTCH pathway, rovalbituzumab-tesirine, inhibition of serine/threonine Aurora A kinase, temozolomide and its dependence on methylation of the MGMT promoter. This first chapter suggests the beginning of precision medicine in small cell lung cancer. The last section focuses on the development of immuno-oncological agents and the information collected from phase 1 and 2 studies: the low intensity of PD-L1 tissue expression and the possible relationship of the activity of these agents as a function of tumor mutational burden are pointed out.

TI  - Immunotherapy in older patients with non-small cell lung cancer: Young International Society of Geriatric Oncology position paper
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - Immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors against programmed cell death receptor (PD-1) and programmed cell death ligand (PD-L1) has been implemented in the treatment pathway of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) from locally advanced disease to the metastatic setting. This approach has resulted in improved survival and a more favourable toxicity profile when compared with chemotherapy. Following the successful introduction of single-agent immunotherapy, current clinical trials are focusing on combination treatments with chemotherapy or radiotherapy or even other immunotherapeutic agents. However, most of the data available from these trials are derived from, and therefore might be more applicable to younger and fitter patients rather than older and often frail lung cancer real-world patients. This article provides a detailed review of these immunotherapy agents with a focus on the data available regarding older NSCLC patients and makes recommendations to fill evidence gaps in this patient population.

TI  - The role of chemoradiotherapy and immunotherapy in stage III NSCLC
T2  - PATHOLOGY & ONCOLOGY RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Locally advanced non-small lung cancer encompasses a diverse range of tumors. In the last few years, the treatment of stage III unresectable non-small lung cancer has evolved significantly. The PACIFIC trial opened a new therapeutic era in the treatment of locally advanced NSCLC, establishing durvalumab consolidation therapy as the new standard of care worldwide. A careful evaluation of this type of lung cancer and a discussion of the management of these patients within a multidisciplinary team represents a crucial step in defining the best treatment strategy for each patient. For unresectable stage III NSCLC, definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) was historically recommended as a treatment with a 5-year survival rate ranging from 20% to 30%. The PACIFIC study conducted in 2017 compared the use of chemoradiotherapy and maintenance therapy with the anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody durvalumab to a placebo in patients with locally advanced NSCLC who had not experienced disease progression. The study was prospective, randomized, and phase III. The administration of this medication in patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has demonstrated a notable improvement in overall survival. Multiple clinical trials are currently exploring various immune checkpoint inhibition regimens to enhance the treatment efficacy in patients with stage III cancer. Our goal is to offer an up-to-date summary of the planned clinical trials for treatment options, focusing on the significant obstacles and prospects in the post-PACIFIC era.

TI  - Progression-free survival estimation of docetaxel-based second-line treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer: a pooled analysis from 18 randomized control trials
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Lung cancer is the foremost cause of cancer-related death globally, with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounting for 85-90% of cases. Targeted therapy is the most essential therapeutic option for NSCLC, other common treatments include radiation therapy, surgery, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy. Objective: Our study objective was to estimate whether progression-free survival (PFS) is an outcome of NSCLC extracted from 18 randomized control trials (RCTs) with docetaxel as experimental group and antineoplastic agent, kinase inhibitor, and monoclonal antibodies as a control group. Methods: We selected relevant studies published between 2011 and 2022 using Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, and Cochrane Library. Advanced NSCLC, chemotherapy, RCT, docetaxel, and second-line treatment were the terms included in the search. A total of 9738 patients were evaluated from the 18 identified studies. We used the meta package of R Studio to perform the meta-analysis. Graphical funnel plots were used to evaluate publication bias visually. Results: Patients who underwent docetaxel-based therapy had a considerably longer PFS than those who got antineoplastic agents, kinase inhibitors, or monoclonal antibodies-based treatment. Patients in the standard treatment arm had a slightly longer PFS than those in the experimental therapy arm in the overall meta-analysis. Conclusion: Docetaxel outperformed monoclonal antibodies, antineoplastic agents, and kinase inhibitors in the second-line therapy of advanced NSCLC since PFS was extensively utilized.

TI  - Use of Immunotherapy in Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer
T2  - ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death in the United States and around the world. Approximately 13% of lung cancers are small cell lung cancer (SCLC). SCLC is generally classified as a limited-stage and extensive-stage disease depending on the extent of involvement. For patients with the extensive-stage disease, until recently, chemotherapy alone has been the recommended treatment, although radiotherapy could be used in select patients for palliation of symptoms. The standard of care for extensive-stage SCLC is platinum doublet chemotherapy with either cisplatin or carboplatin in combination with etoposide. Even though first-line therapy has an initial response rate of 60-80%, the prognosis is poor, with overall survival of 10-12 months. The only FDA-approved second line of therapy is topotecan, approved both as an intravenous formulation as well as an oral formulation, with response rates of 6-12% in chemorefractory disease and 15-37% in chemosensitive disease. Immunotherapy has recently been approved as a first-line agent in metastatic SCLC in combination with chemotherapy. It is also approved as a third-line agent in metastatic SCLC after the failure of two chemotherapy regimens. The FDA approved four drugs, two of them being PD-1 inhibitors (pembrolizumab, nivolumab), and two of them being PD-L1 inhibitors (atezolizumab and durvalumab) in SCLC. This review article summarizes the significance of immunotherapy in the treatment of extensive-stage SCLC, its side effects, and limitations.

TI  - Curcumin and Its Analogs in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Treatment: Challenges and Expectations
T2  - BIOMOLECULES
M3  - Review
AB  - Researchers have made crucial advances in understanding the pathogenesis and therapeutics of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), improving our understanding of lung tumor biology and progression. Although the survival of NSCLC patients has improved due to chemoradiotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, overall NSCLC recovery and survival rates remain low. Thus, there is an urgent need for the continued development of novel NSCLC drugs or combination therapies with less toxicity. Although the anticancer effectiveness of curcumin (Cur) and some Cur analogs has been reported in many studies, the results of clinical trials have been inconsistent. Therefore, in this review, we collected the latest related reports about the anti-NSCLC mechanisms of Cur, its analogs, and Cur in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents via the Pubmed database (accessed on 18 June 2022). Furthermore, we speculated on the interplay of Cur and various molecular targets relevant to NSCLC with discovery studio and collected clinical trials of Cur against NSCLC to clarify the role of Cur and its analogs in NSCLC treatment. Despite their challenges, Cur/Cur analogs may serve as promising therapeutic agents or adjuvants for lung carcinoma treatment.

AB  - Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive, poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma with distinct clinical, pathological and molecular characteristics. Despite robust responses to initial chemotherapy and radiation, the prognosis of patients with SCLC remains poor with an overall 5-year survival rate of less than 10 %. Despite the fact that numerous molecularly targeted approaches have thus far failed to demonstrate clinical utility in SCLC, further advances will rely on better definition of the biological pathways that drive survival, proliferation and metastasis. Recent next-generation, molecular profiling studies have identified many new therapeutic targets in SCLC, as well as extreme genomic instability which explains the high degree of resistance. A wide variety of anti-angiogenic agents, growth factor inhibitors, pro-apoptotic agents, and epigenetic modulators have been evaluated in SCLC and many studies of these strategies are on-going. Perhaps the most promising approaches involve agents targeting cancer stem cell pathways and immunomodulatory drugs that interfere with the PD1 and CTLA-4 pathways. SCLC offers many barriers to the development of successful therapy, including limited tumor samples, inadequate preclinical models, high mutational burden, and aggressive tumor growth which impairs functional status and hampers enrollment on clinical trials.

Standard therapy (surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy with temozolomide) has very limited effectiveness, with median overall survival of patients no longer than 15 months. Progress in genetics and epigenetics of GBM over the past decade has revealed various aberrations in cellular signaling pathways, the tumor microenvironment, and pathological angiogenesis. A number of targeted anticancer drugs, such as small-molecule kinase inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies, have been evaluated in clinical trials with newly-diagnosed, as well as recurrent GBM. Unfortunately, to date, only a single anti-angiogenic agent, bevacizumab, has been approved for the treatment of recurrent GBM in the USA and Canada. The novel possibilities of cancer immunotherapy, especially immune checkpoint inhibitors, are being evaluated in clinical trials of patients with GBM. The most recent clinical experiences with targeted therapy as well as immunotherapy of GBM are given in this review. The relative lack of success of some of these approaches recently revealed in well-designed randomized clinical trials is also discussed.

AB  - Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive tumor characterized by rapid doubling time and high propensity for early development of disseminated disease. Although most patients respond to initial therapy with a platinum doublet, the majority of those with limited stage and virtually all patients with metastatic disease eventually develop tumor progression for which there are limited treatment options. There have been no recent changes in the treatment of SCLC, with platinum plus etoposide and topotecan as the standard first-line and second-line respectively, neither showing survival benefit over the combination of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and vincristine, which was developed in the 1970s. More recently, a new understanding of the biology of SCLC has led to the development of novel drugs, of which the most promising are the immune checkpoint inhibitors and the antibody drug conjugate rovalpituzumab tesirine.

T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Unleashing the immune system to fight cancer has become one of the main treatment modalities since the anti-CTLA-4 antibody, ipilimumab was approved for patients with advanced melanoma in 2011. Pembrolizumab and nivolumab, two anti-PD-1 antibodies recently approved for the treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma, are being actively investigated for the treatment of multiple caners including lung, breast, bladder and renal cancers along with other anti-PD-1/L1 antibodies. Early results of combining of anti-CTLA-4 antibody and anti-PD-1 antibody treatment for advanced melanoma patients are showing impressive response rates with manageable toxicity profiles. There are several other checkpoint molecules that are likely potential inhibitory targets. The outcome of blocking some of these negative immune regulators, such as LAG-3 or TIM-3, is being pursued in the clinic or about to enter clinical development. Blockade of these molecules is demonstrating promising preclinical activity alone or when combined with anti-PD-1/L1. Future studies will define bio-markers of these therapies and how to target them alone or in combination with other immunotherapies, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and small molecule inhibitors.

T2  - HUMAN VACCINES & IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICS
M3  - Review
AB  - The usual treatments for patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), such as advanced lung adenocarcinoma, are unspecific and aggressive, and include lung resection, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Recently, treatment with monoclonal antibodies and biological inhibitors has emerged as an effective alternative, generating effective results with few side effects. In recent years, several clinical trials using monoclonal antibodies presented potential benefits to NSCLC, and 4 of them are already approved for the treatment of NSCLC, such as cetuximab, bevacizumab, nivolumab and pembrolizumab. Also, biological inhibitors are attractive tolls for biological applications. Among the approved inhibitors are crizotinib, erlotinib, afatinib and gefitinib, and side effects are usually mild to intense. Nevertheless, biological molecule treatments are under development, and several new monoclonal antibodies and biological inhibitors are in trial to treat NSCLC. Also under trial study are as follows: anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibodies (nimotuzumab and ficlatuzumab), anti-IGF 1 receptor (IGF-1R) monoclonal antibody (figitumumab), anti-NR-LU-10 monoclonal antibody (nofetumomab) as well as antibodies directly affecting the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) molecule (ipilimumab and tremelimumab), to receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand (RANKL) (denosumab) or to polymerase enzyme (veliparib and olaparib). Among new inhibitors under investigation are poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (veliparib and olaparib) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor (buparlisib). However, the success of immunotherapies still requires extensive research and additional controlled trials to evaluate the long-term benefits and side effects.

TI  - Chemoradiotherapy of locally advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer: state of the art and perspectives
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of reviewThe treatment of locally advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is becoming a significant challenge because of a growing proportion of patients with unresectable or potentially eligible for surgery after a multimodality treatment, stage II to III disease. Despite a multimodality approach consisting in concurrent chemoradiotherapy, the prognosis remains poor.Recent findingsDifferent strategies, including induction and consolidation chemotherapy, chemotherapy regimens, fractionation and radiation doses have been evaluated in phase II and III trials, as well as new therapeutic approaches such as immunotherapy. For patients with resectable stage III disease the optimal strategy remains unclear. The American Society for Radiation and Clinical Oncology and the European Society for Medical Oncology published recent guidelines in 2015.SummaryConcurrent chemoradiotherapy improves overall survival compared with sequential chemotherapy followed by radiation. Adding induction or consolidation chemotherapy to chemoradiotherapy does not appear to improve the outcome. Chemotherapy based on cisplatin combined with radiation is recommended in stage III NSCLC. The standard dose and fractionation of radiotherapy are 60Gy, one daily fraction of 2Gy over 6 weeks. Targeted therapies and immunotherapy may improve the management of locally advanced NSCLC in the future.

TI  - Beyond Concurrent Chemoradiation: The Emerging Role of PD-1/PD-L1 Inhibitors in Stage III Lung Cancer
T2  - CLINICAL CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Concurrent chemoradiation (cCRT) with platinum-based chemotherapy is standard-of-care therapy for patients with stage III unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Although cCRT is potentially curative, 5-year overall survival has hovered around 20%, despite extensive efforts to improve outcomes with increasing doses of conformal radiation and intensification of systemic therapy with either induction or consolidation chemotherapy. PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors have demonstrated unprecedented efficacy in patients with stage IV NSCLC, In addition, predinical and early clinical evidence suggests that chemotherapy and radiation may work synergistically with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy to promote antitumor immunity, which has led to the initiation of clinical trials testing these drugs in patients with stage Ill NSCLC. A preliminary report of a randomized phase III trial, the PACIFIC trial, demonstrated an impressive increase in median progression-free survival with consolidative durvalumab, a PD-L1 inhibitor, compared with observation after cCRT. Here, we discuss the clinical and translational implications of integrating PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in the management of patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC. (C) 2018 AACR.

Advanced cytological methods and targeted sequencing for candidate tumor-specific mutations may improve the sensitivity of cerebrospinal fluid diagnostics in leptomeningeal metastases. Targeted treatments like epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors for non-small cell lung cancer, anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 treatments for breast cancer or B-rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma-targeted or immunotherapy for melanoma have an emerging role in the management of this condition.SummaryNovel diagnostic approaches and the introduction of targeted agents may improve the clinical management of patients with leptomeningeal metastases from solid cancers.

AB  - Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) remains a major public health problem and accounts for 10% to 15% of all lung cancers. It has unique clinical features such as rapid growth, early metastatic spread, and widespread dissemination. A platinum-etoposide combination is the backbone treatment of SCLC; addition of thoracic and prophylactic cranial irradiation has been shown to improve outcome in limited-stage SCLC and in subgroups of extensive-stage SCLC. Over the last decade, significant progress has been made in characterizing the SCLC tumor biology and its developmental pathways. Most recently, efforts have focused not only on molecular targets, but also on the development of novel drugs targeting tumor evolution and immune escape mechanisms; these approaches are promising and offer opportunities that may finally improve the outcomes of SCLC.

AB  - Introduction: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) are now a therapeutic option for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. ICI, such as the PD-1 inhibitors nivolumab and pembrolizumab and the PD-L1 inhibitor atezolizumab, have already been marketed for the treatment of pretreated patients with advanced NSCLC. Other notable PD-L1 inhibitors under development include avelumab and durvalumab.Areas covered: This article reviews literature on durvalumab development, from the preclinical data to the results of phase III clinical trials, whether published or presented at international scientific conferences. Ongoing clinical trials were also reviewed.Expert opinion: Early phase trials of durvalumab monotherapy (and in combination) have demonstrated activity in advanced NSCLC patients and it has demonstrated a good safety profile. The authors believe that durvalumab will likely play an important role in future treatment strategies for NSCLC. The PACIFIC trial assessing durvalumab after standard chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced NSCLC has already met its primary endpoint and the potential of durvalumab will be reinforced if phase III randomized studies of first-line (MYSTIC trial) and second or subsequent (ARCTIC trial) lines of therapy demonstrate superiority over the current standard of care.

TI  - Management of brain metastases according to molecular subtypes
T2  - NATURE REVIEWS NEUROLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - This Review outlines the advances of molecular treatment of brain metastases from non-small-cell lung cancer, breast cancer and melanoma. Substantial improvements in survival have been achieved in patients with molecular subgroups whose alterations can be targeted with specific molecular compounds.The incidence of brain metastases has markedly increased in the past 20 years owing to progress in the treatment of malignant solid tumours, earlier diagnosis by MRI and an ageing population. Although local therapies remain the mainstay of treatment for many patients with brain metastases, a growing number of systemic options are now available and/or are under active investigation. HER2-targeted therapies (lapatinib, neratinib, tucatinib and trastuzumab emtansine), alone or in combination, yield a number of intracranial responses in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer brain metastases. New inhibitors are being investigated in brain metastases from ER-positive or triple-negative breast cancer. Several generations of EGFR and ALK inhibitors have shown activity on brain metastases from EGFR and ALK mutant non-small-cell lung cancer. Immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) hold promise in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer without druggable mutations and in patients with triple-negative breast cancer. The survival of patients with brain metastases from melanoma has substantially improved after the advent of BRAF inhibitors and ICIs (ipilimumab, nivolumab and pembrolizumab). The combination of targeted agents or ICIs with stereotactic radiosurgery could further improve the response rates and survival but the risk of radiation necrosis should be monitored. Advanced neuroimaging and liquid biopsy will hopefully improve response evaluation.

AB  - Simple Summary Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for about 15% of lung cancers and it has limited therapeutic options and poor prognosis. There has been no real progress for over 30 years in the treatment of this aggressive tumor type and platinum based chemotherapy represented the cornerstone of therapy. Immune checkpoint inhibitors are the first agents in the last decades to determine an improvement in outcomes of patients with extensive stage (ES) SCLC patients. In the IMpower 133 and CASPIAN studies, the addition of atezolizumab or durvalumab, respectively, to first-line chemotherapy produced a significant improvement in overall survival with an acceptable safety profile in previously untreated patients with ES-SCLC, leading to a new standard of care. This review summarizes the main results observed with checkpoint inhibitors in SCLC, discussing the critical issues related to the use of novel checkpoint inhibitors and the future research with immunotherapy agents in SCLC. Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive tumor type with limited therapeutic options and poor prognosis. Chemotherapy regimens containing platinum represent the cornerstone of treatment for patients with extensive disease, but there has been no real progress for 30 years. The evidence that SCLC is characterized by a high mutational burden led to the development of immune-checkpoint inhibitors as single agents or in combination with chemotherapy. Randomized phase III trials demonstrated that the combination of atezolizumab (IMpower-133) or durvalumab (CASPIAN) with platinum-etoposide chemotherapy improved overall survival of patients with extensive disease. Instead, the KEYNOTE-604 study demonstrated that the addition of pembrolizumab to chemotherapy failed to significantly improve overall survival, but it prolonged progression-free survival. The safety profile of these combinations was similar with the known safety profiles of all single agents and no new adverse events were observed. Nivolumab and pembrolizumab single agents showed anti-tumor activity and acceptable safety profile in Checkmate 032 and KEYNOTE 028/158 trials, respectively, in patients with SCLC after platinum-based therapy and at least one prior line of therapy. Future challenges are the identification predictive biomarkers of response to immunotherapy in SCLC and the definition of the role of immunotherapy in patients with limited stage SCLC, in combination with radiotherapy or with other biological agents.

TI  - Impacting tumor cell-fate by targeting the inhibitor of apoptosis protein survivin
T2  - MOLECULAR CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - Survivin (BIRC5), a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family that inhibits caspases and blocks cell death is highly expressed in cancer and is associated with a poorer clinical outcome. Functioning simultaneously during cell division and apoptosis inhibition, survivin plays a pivotal role in determining cell survival. Survivin has consistently been identified by molecular profiling analysis to be associated with higher tumor grade, more advanced disease, abbreviated survival, accelerated rates of recurrence, and chemotherapy and radiation resistance. Survivin's differential expression in cancer compared to normal tissue and its role as a nodal protein in a number of cellular pathways make it a highly flexible therapeutic target, suitable for small-molecule inhibitiors, molecular antagonists, and vaccination-based therapies. By targeting survivin it is hoped that multiple tumor signaling circuitries may be simultaneously disabled. This effect may be applicable to many tumor histologies irrespective of specific genetic makeup. To date, survivin inhibitors have shown modest activity as single agents, but it is anticipated that when given in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy or monoclonal antibodies they may exhibit enhanced efficacy. This review discusses the complex circuitry of survivin in human cancers and highlights clinical trials involving novel agents that target this important protein.

T2  - CANCER IMMUNOLOGY IMMUNOTHERAPY
M3  - Review
AB  - Cancer vaccines contain tumor antigens in a pro-inflammatory context with the purpose to generate potent antitumor immune responses. However, tumor cells develop different immunosuppressive mechanisms that limit the effectiveness of an anticancer immune response. Therefore, therapeutic vaccine treatment alone is usually not sufficient to generate tumor regression or survival improvement, especially in the advanced disease scenario in which most clinical studies have been conducted. Combining cancer vaccines with different anticancer therapies such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy and other immunotherapeutic agents has had different levels of success. However, the combination of cancer vaccines with different mechanisms of action has not been explored in clinical trials. To address this issue, the current review summarizes the main clinical and immunological results obtained with two different therapeutic vaccines used in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer patients, inducing an immune response against epidermal growth factor (CIMAvax-EGF) and NGcGM3 ganglioside (racotumomab). We also discuss preliminary findings obtained in a trial of combination of these two vaccines and future challenges with these therapies.

TI  - How I Treat Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Refractory to Immunotherapy
T2  - CANCER JOURNAL
M3  - Review
AB  - Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality despite continued advances in diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Although the development of immune checkpoint inhibitors has revolutionized the treatment landscape for advanced non-small cell lung cancer, many patients either have primary resistance to these agents or eventually develop secondary resistance necessitating a change to an alternate therapy. Understanding novel patterns of response to immunotherapy is crucial in determining appropriate selection and sequencing of treatment. Chemotherapy remains the standard of care in immunotherapy-refractory disease, but multiple trials are ongoing to explore the role of combination radioimmunotherapy and rechallenging with immunotherapy either alone or in combination with other antineoplastic agents.

T2  - EXPERT OPINION ON BIOLOGICAL THERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Despite recent advances with new chemotherapeutic agents and target therapies, the prognosis of NSCLC remains poor. Recent results from clinical trials of immunotherapeutic agents, especially with immune checkpoint inhibitors, make this approach very exciting in NSCLC. Ipilimumab is a monoclonal antibody directed against cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 that is able to stimulate the antitumour immune response by promoting T-cell activation.Areas covered: We have reviewed the literature and have described the most important results obtained with ipilimumab in NSCLC in recent trials with a specific focus on its peculiar toxicity profile and pattern of response. Trials ongoing with ipilimumab are also reported.Expert opinion: The results from clinical trials with ipilimumab are promising. Some important issues in the near future will be to identify prognostic and predictive biomarkers to select patients who could benefit from this drug. Further studies are warranted to understand how to combine ipilimumab with other anticancer strategies.

T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - The treatment paradigm of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has rapidly changed in recent years following the introduction of immune-checkpoint inhibition (ICI). Pre-clinically, both chemotherapy and radiotherapy modulate the tumour microenvironment, providing the rationale for clinical trials evaluating their role in combination with immunotherapy. Standard-of-care treatment for patients with unresectable stage III disease is concurrent chemoradiotherapy (cCRT); however, only recently, the combination with ICI has been explored. The Phase 3 PACIFIC study randomised 713 patients with confirmed locally advanced, unresectable, stage III NSCLC, whose disease has not progressed following cCRT, to either the anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) agent durvalumab (Imfinzi(R)Down-pointing Triangle, AstraZeneca UK Limited) or placebo. Patients with a PD-L1 status >= 1% treated with durvalumab had a significantly longer median progression-free survival compared with placebo (17.2 vs. 5.6 months, respectively; HR: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.41-0.63), prolonged median overall survival (OS) (NR vs. 28.7 months, respectively; HR: 0.68; 99.73% CI: 0.47-0.997; P = 0.0025) and long-term clinical benefit (3-year OS HR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.55-0.86). Grade 3 or 4 toxicity was marginally greater in the durvalumab cohort versus placebo (30.5% vs. 26.1%). Based on these results, durvalumab has been licensed in this setting, and further clinical trials are exploring the use of ICI in unresectable stage III NSCLC.

TI  - Immunotherapy for Lung Cancer-Improving Outcomes in Patients With Locally Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer With Immunotherapy
T2  - CANCER JOURNAL
M3  - Review
AB  - Patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a heterogenous group encompassing stage IIIA-IIIC disease, often have surgically unresectable cancer and are managed with concurrent chemoradiation. Since the establishment of platinum-based chemoradiation as standard of care for unresectable locally advanced NSCLC, various strategies including escalating radiation dose, targeted therapies, antiangiogenic agents, and induction or consolidation chemotherapy have failed to show improvement in outcomes. However, recently, use of consolidation immunotherapy with durvalumab following concurrent chemoradiation therapy has been associated with improvement in survival and has led to a paradigm shift. In this review, we will summarize results from trials of immunotherapy in locally advanced NSCLC and comment on ongoing trials and potential future investigations.

T2  - ANTI-CANCER AGENTS IN MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY
M3  - Review
AB  - Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICIs) have remarkably modified the way solid tumors are managed, including breast cancer. Unfortunately, only a relatively small number of breast cancer patients significantly respond to these treatments. To maximize the immunotherapy benefit in breast cancer, several efforts are currently being put forward for the identification of i) the best therapeutic strategy (i.e. ICI monotherapy or in association with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or other drugs); ii) optimal timing for administration (e.g. early/advanced stage of disease; adjuvant/neoadjuvant setting); iii) most effective and reliable predictive biomarkers of response (e.g. tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, programmed death-ligand 1, microsatellite instability associated with mismatch repair deficiency, and tumor mutational burden). In this article, we review the impacts and gaps in the characterization of immune-related biomarkers raised by clinical and translational research studies with immunotherapy treatments. Particular emphasis has been put on the documented evidence of significant clinical benefits of ICI in different randomized clinical trials, along with preanalytical and analytical issues in predictive biomarkers pathological assessment.

TI  - Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: Progress, Challenges, and Prospects
T2  - CELLS
M3  - Review
AB  - Non-small cell lung cancer is one of the most common types of malignances worldwide and the main cause of cancer-related deaths. Current treatment for NSCLC is based on surgical resection, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and targeted therapy, with poor therapeutic effectiveness. In recent years, immune checkpoint inhibitors have applied in NSCLC treatment. A large number of experimental studies have shown that immune checkpoint inhibitors are safer and more effective than traditional therapeutic modalities and have allowed for the development of better guidance in the clinical treatment of advanced NSCLC patients. In this review, we describe clinical trials using ICI immunotherapies for NSCLC treatment, the available data on clinical efficacy, and the emerging evidence regarding biomarkers.

T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of reviewExtensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) remains a disease with a dismal prognosis, with median survival of approximately 8-10 months. Despite many attempts to develop effective systemic therapies, very little progress has been made in the last several decades. Platinum-based combination chemotherapy remains the standard of care in the first-line setting and is associated with high response rates albeit short-lived. However, there have been recent advances in the use of radiation therapy, as well as new insights into the biology of SCLC.Recent findingsSome of the most appreciable advances in the last decade have involved the use of local radiation therapy. With the use of new laboratory techniques such as genomic sequencing, there remains promise of rationally targeted drug development. Circulating tumor cell research may also provide insights to SCLC biology and further refine treatment.SummarySystemic therapy for SCLC has changed little over the past 30 years with the most significant advances in ES-SCLC relating to radiotherapy rather than systemic therapy. The effectiveness of prophylactic cranial irradiation and thoracic radiotherapy has renewed interest in therapeutics focused on the modulation of DNA damage or repair. Recent developments in genomic sequencing and immunotherapy may translate to new treatment paradigms for SCLC.

M3  - Article
AB  - Daily low-dose carboplatin plus concurrent thoracic radiotherapy is the standard treatment for elderly patients with unresectable clinical stage (c-Stage) III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in Japan. However, a phase I study by Omori et al. suggests that weekly carboplatin and nab-paclitaxel plus concurrent thoracic radiotherapy have comparable efficacy outcomes with more manageable adverse events. In December 2020, we initiated a randomized controlled trial in Japan to confirm whether the weekly carboplatin plus nab-paclitaxel regimen is noninferior to the daily low-dose carboplatin regimen for concurrent chemoradiotherapy in elderly patients with unresectable c-Stage III NSCLC. We plan to enroll 166 patients from 50 institutions in 3.5 years. The primary endpoint is overall survival. The secondary endpoints are progression-free survival, response rate, proportion of patients starting maintenance durvalumab therapy, adverse events, site of progression, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Trial Outcome Index deterioration and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living deterioration.

TI  - Small-Cell Lung Cancer: Clinical Management and Unmet Needs New Perspectives for an Old Problem
T2  - CURRENT DRUG TARGETS
M3  - Review
AB  - Small cell lung cancer is a highly aggressive, difficult to treat neoplasm. Among all lung tumors, small cell lung cancers account for about 20%. Patients typically include heavy smokers in 70s age group, presenting with symptoms such as intrathoracic tumors growth, distant spread or paraneoplastic syndromes at the time of diagnosis. A useful and functional classification divides small cell lung cancers into limited disease and extensive disease. Concurrent chemo-radiotherapy is the standard treatment for limited disease, with improved survival when combined with prophylactic cranial irradiation. Platinum compounds (cisplatin/carboplatin) plus etoposide remain the cornerstone for extensive disease. Nevertheless, despite high chemo-and radio-sensitivity of this cancer, nearly all patients relapse within the first two years and the prognosis is extremely poor. A deeper understanding about small cell lung cancer carcinogenesis led to develop and test a considerable number of new and targeted agents but the results are currently weak or insufficient. To date, small cell lung cancer is still a challenge for researchers. In this review, key aspects of small cell lung cancer management and controversial points of standard and new treatments will be discussed.

AB  - The management of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) varies according to stage. Surgical resection is reserved for operable patients with early-stage NSCLC, while high-dose target radiation-stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT)-is reserved for patients whose comorbidities prohibit them from a major surgical procedure. The treatment of locally advanced NSCLC (LA-NSCLC) is stratified according to resectability. Those with resectable disease may require additional treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation, while patients with unresectable disease will require definitive chemoradiation therapy with adjuvant durvalumab. Patients with limited metastatic disease benefit from the combination of SBRT and systemic therapy.

TI  - SBRT combined with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in NSCLC treatment: a focus on the mechanisms, advances, and future challenges
T2  - JOURNAL OF HEMATOLOGY & ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1), and others have shown potent clinical efficacy and have revolutionized the treatment protocols of a broad spectrum of tumor types, especially non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Despite the substantial optimism of treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, there is still a large proportion of patients with advanced NSCLC who are resistant to the inhibitors. Preclinical and clinical trials have demonstrated that radiotherapy can induce a systemic antitumor immune response and have a great potential to sensitize refractory "cold" tumors to immunotherapy. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), as a novel radiotherapy modality that delivers higher doses to smaller target lesions, has shown favorable antitumor effects with significantly improved local and distant control as well as better survival benefits in various solid tumors. Notably, research has revealed that SBRT is superior to conventional radiotherapy, possibly because of its more powerful immune activation effects. Thus, PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors combined with SBRT instead of conventional radiotherapy might be more promising to fight against NSCLC, further achieving more favorable survival outcomes. In this review, we focus on the underlying mechanisms and recent advances of SBRT combined with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors with an emphasis on some future challenges and directions that warrant further investigation.

TI  - EGFR-directed monoclonal antibodies in combination with chemotherapy for treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer: an updated review of clinical trials and new perspectives in biomarkers analysis
T2  - CANCER TREATMENT REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - Lung cancer still represents one of the most common and fatal neoplasm, accounting for nearly 30% of all cancer-related deaths. Targeted therapies based on molecular tumor features and programmed death-1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand-1 (PDL-1) blockade immunotherapy have offered new therapeutic options for patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)pathway promotes tumor growth and progression, including angiogenesis, invasion, metastasis and inhibition of apoptosis, providing a strong rationale for targeting this pathway. EGFR expression is detected in up to 85% of NSCLC and has been demonstrated to be associated with poor prognosis. Two approaches for blocking EGFR signaling are available: prevention of ligand binding to the extracellular domain with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and inhibition of the intracellular tyrosine kinase activity with small molecules. There is a strong rationale to consider the tumor's level of EGFR expression as one of the most significant predictive biomarkers in this setting. In this paper we provide an update focusing on the current status of EGFR-directed mAbs use for the treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC, through a review of all clinical trials involving anti-EGFR mAbs in combination with chemotherapy (CT) for advanced disease and with chemo-radiotherapy for stage III disease. Here we also discuss the current status of predictive biomarkers for anti-EGFR mAbs when added to first-line CT in patients with advanced NSCLC. Finally, we focused on the relevance of EGFR fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) + and immunohistochemistry (IHC)-Score >= 200 as predictive biomarkers for the selection of patients who would be most likely to derive a clinical benefit from treatment with CT in combination with anti-EGFR mAbs, with particular reference also to histology.

M3  - Review
AB  - Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive disease with distinct pathological, clinical, and molecular characteristics from non-small-cell lung cancer. SCLC has high metastatic potential, resulting in a clinically poor prognosis. Early concurrent chemo-radiation is the standard of care for limited-stage SCLC (LS-SCLC). Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) is recommended for patients with LS-SCLC without progression of disease after initial therapy. A combination of etoposide and cisplatin or carboplatin remains the mainstay of first-line treatment for ES-SCLC, with the addition of atezolizumab, now becoming standard. Most SCLCs initially respond to therapy but almost invariably recur. Topotecan and amrubicin (in Japan) remain the primary chemotherapy options for relapsed SCLC. Immunotherapy, including nivolumab with or without ipilimumab, is now available for refractory disease. In general, the poor prognosis of SCLC has not improved significantly for more than 3 decades. Recently, next-generation molecular profiling studies have identified new therapeutic targets for SCLC. A variety of proapoptotic agents, compounds capitalizing on DNA-repair defects, immunotherapy agents, and antibody-drug conjugates are being evaluated in SCLC, with a number of them showing early promise.

AB  - In this review article we discuss the diagnostic workup and current treatment strategies for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Anatomical resection and systematic lymph node dissection is the recommended treatment for early-stage NSCLC. Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is an alternative for non-operable patients. Locally advanced NSCLC could be treated with a combination of chemotherapy, radiotherapy and immunotherapy, and in select cases followed by surgical resection. Treatment for patients with metastasized NSCLC depends on molecular tumor characteristics, PD-L1 expression and could consist of chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapy or a combination of these modalities. In all stages, best supportive care is an option to consider. Because of the success of immunotherapy and targeted therapy for stage IV NSCLC, numerous trials have started to investigate the efficacy of these modalities in early-stage NSCLC as well, further optimizing treatment strategies for this patient group.

TI  - Efficacy of different therapies for brain metastases of non-small cell lung cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL LUNG CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: As one of the most common causes of death in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), brain metastases (BM) have attracted attention and debate about treatment options, especially for patients with negative driver genes or resistance to targeted agents. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the potential benefit of different therapeutic regimens for intracranial lesions in non-targeted therapy NSCLC patients. Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted in databases including PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. The primary endpoints included the intracerebral objective response rate (icORR) and intracerebral progression-free survival (iPFS) in patients with BM. Results: Thirty-six studies involving 1,774 NSCLC patients with baseline BM were included in this meta-analysis. Antitumor agents plus radiotherapy (RT) showed the most significant synergistic effects; the highest pooled icORR that appeared in the combination of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) and RT was 81% [95% confidence interval (CI): 16-100%], and the median iPFS was 7.04 months (95% CI: 2.54-11.55 months). The pooled icORR and median iPFS of RT plus chemotherapy were 46% (95% CI: 34-57%) and 5.7 months (95% CI: 3.90-7.50 months), respectively. The highest median iPFS in nivolumab plus ipilimumab plus chemotherapy was 13.5 months (95% CI: 8.35-18.65 months). ICI plus chemotherapy also showed potent antitumor activity in BM, with a pooled icORR of 56% (95% CI: 29-82%) and a median iPFS of 6.9 months (95% CI: 3.20-10.60 months). Notably, the subgroup analysis indicated that the pooled icORR of patients in programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) (>= 50%) who received ICI was 54% (95% CI: 30-77%), and that of patients who received first-line ICI was 69.0% (95% CI: 51-85%). Conclusions: ICI-based combination treatment provides a long-term survival benefit for non-targeted therapy patients, with the most significant benefits observed in improving icORR and prolonging overall survival (OS) and iPFS. In particular, patients who received first-line treatment or who were PD-L1-positive had a more significant survival benefit from aggressive ICI-based therapies. For patients with a PD-L1-negative status, chemotherapy plus RT led to better clinical outcomes than other treatment regimens. These innovative findings could help clinicians to better select therapeutic strategies for NSCLC patients with BM.

TI  - Derived neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio has the potential to predict safety and outcomes of durvalumab after chemoradiation in non-small cell lung cancer
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The usefulness of the derived neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (dNLR) and its dynamics before/after durvalumab consolidation therapy to predict safety or efficacy remains unclear. We retrospectively reviewed patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer treated with durvalumab consolidation therapy after chemoradiotherapy (D group) or chemoradiotherapy alone (non-D group) at multiple institutions. We investigated the association between dNLR, or its dynamics, and pneumonitis, checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonitis (CIP), irAEs, and efficacy. Ninety-eight and fifty-six patients were enrolled in the D and non-D groups, respectively. The dNLR at baseline was significantly lower in patients who experienced irAEs or CIP than in those who did not. The low dNLR group, 28 days following durvalumab consolidation therapy (dNLR28 <= 3), demonstrated longer progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) than the high dNLR group (dNLR28 > 3) (PFS, hazard ratio [HR] 0.44, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.22-0.88, p = 0.020; OS, HR 0.39, 95% CI 0.16-0.94, p = 0.037). Among patients with high dNLR at baseline (dNLR > 3), the dNLR28 <= 3 group showed longer PFS than the dNLR28 > 3 group (p = 0.010). The dNLR is a predictive factor for irAEs and CIP in patients receiving durvalumab consolidation therapy. The dNLR at 28 days after durvalumab consolidation therapy and its dynamics predict favorable outcomes.

TI  - Advances in Immunotherapy for the Treatment of Adult Glioblastoma: Overcoming Chemical and Physical Barriers
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Simple Summary The poor prognosis for glioblastoma (GBM) despite the existence of a standard-of-care treatment of resection, radiotherapy, and adjuvant chemotherapy has necessitated the exploration of other therapeutic avenues. One particularly promising avenue is an immunotherapeutic approach in which the body ' s immune system is artificially stimulated to directly identify and attack the tumor cells. A variety of methods including immune checkpoint inhibition, T-cell transfer, vaccination, and a viral approach are being developed for GBM. Barriers such as tumor heterogeneity, the physical blood-brain barrier, the immunosuppressive nature of GBM, and the limited number of identifiable GBM-specific targets have reduced the efficacy of the aforementioned approaches. In the following review, we document the advances in immunotherapy, the barriers to implementation, and the development of a new technology (microbubble-enhanced focused ultrasound) to overcome the physical barriers to immunotherapy. Glioblastoma, or glioblastoma multiforme (GBM, WHO Grade IV), is a highly aggressive adult glioma. Despite extensive efforts to improve treatment, the current standard-of-care (SOC) regimen, which consists of maximal resection, radiotherapy, and temozolomide (TMZ), achieves only a 12-15 month survival. The clinical improvements achieved through immunotherapy in several extracranial solid tumors, including non-small-cell lung cancer, melanoma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, inspired investigations to pursue various immunotherapeutic interventions in adult glioblastoma patients. Despite some encouraging reports from preclinical and early-stage clinical trials, none of the tested agents have been convincing in Phase III clinical trials. One, but not the only, factor that is accountable for the slow progress is the blood-brain barrier, which prevents most antitumor drugs from reaching the target in appreciable amounts. Herein, we review the current state of immunotherapy in glioblastoma and discuss the significant challenges that prevent advancement. We also provide thoughts on steps that may be taken to remediate these challenges, including the application of ultrasound technologies.

TI  - Molecular Mechanisms and Targeted Therapies Including Immunotherapy for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
T2  - CURRENT CANCER DRUG TARGETS
M3  - Review
AB  - Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Molecular targeted therapy has greatly advanced the field of treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which accounts for the majority of lung cancers. Indeed, gefitinib, which was the first molecular targeted therapeutic agent, has actually doubled the survival time of NSCLC patients. Vigorous efforts of clinicians and researchers have revealed that lung cancer develops through the activating mutations of many driver genes including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), c-ros oncogene 1 (ROSI), v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF), and rearranged during transfection (RET) genes. Although ALK, ROS1, and RET are rare genetic abnormalities, corresponding tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) can exert dramatic therapeutic effects. In addition to anticancer drugs targeting driver genes, bevacizumab specifically binds to human vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and blocks the VEGF signaling pathway. The VEGF signal blockade suppresses angiogenesis in tumor tissues and inhibits tumor growth. In this review, we also explore immunotherapy, which is a promising new NSCLC treatment approach. In general, antitumor immune responses are suppressed in cancer patients, and cancer cells escape from the immune surveillance mechanism. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are antibodies that target the primary escape mechanisms, immune checkpoints. Patients who respond to ICIs are reported to experience long-lasting therapeutic effects. A wide range of clinical approaches, including combination therapy involving chemotherapy or radiation plus adjuvant therapy, are being developed.

TI  - Clinical significance of the advanced lung cancer inflammation index in patients with limited-stage small cell lung cancer treated with chemoradiotherapy
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the study was to investigate the prognostic significance of the advanced lung cancer inflammation index (ALI) in patients with limited-stage small-cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC) undergoing definite chemo-radiotherapy (CRT). We included 87 patients with LS-SCLC from South Korea, treated between 2005 and 2019 with definite CRT. ALI was calculated using body mass index, serum albumin, and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio. We categorized 38 patients into the high ALI group (ALI >= 44.3) and 48 into the low ALI group (ALI<44.3). Patients in the high ALI group exhibited longer overall survival (OS) than patients in the low ALI group. In multivariate analysis, prophylactic cranial irradiation (hazard ratio [HR]=0.366, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.20-0.66, P=0.0008), and high ALI (HR=0.475, 95% CI 0.27-0.84, P=0.0103) were identified as independent prognostic factors for predicting better OS. Notably, a high ALI score was particularly indicative of longer survival in patients treated with the combination of etoposide and cisplatin. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that a high pretreatment ALI was significantly associated with better OS in patients with LS-SCLC undergoing definite CRT. This suggests that ALI could be a useful tool for predicting prognosis and guiding chemotherapy regimen selections in clinical practice for LS-SCLC.

TI  - Targeted therapy in brain metastasis
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of reviewTo review the state of the art and new developments in the field of targeted agents for brain metastases.Recent findingsThe huge amount of information on new molecular compounds and the advances in understanding the molecular pathways that mediate brain colonization have led to an increase of interest in preclinical and clinical investigations in the field of brain metastases. Targeted therapies can be employed either on established brain metastases or in a prevention setting. Targeting angiogenesis is an attractive approach. Up to date, large clinical trial datasets have shown that antiangiogenic agents do not increase the risk of bleeding into the brain. Bevacizumab (an anti-VEGF agent) is undergoing investigation in clinical trials on brain metastases from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), breast cancer and melanoma. Sunitinib, a multitarget small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), is a promising agent in brain metastases from renal cell cancer. The EGFR inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib have a definite activity in brain metastases from NSCLC with activating EGFR mutations. Regarding HER2-positive breast cancer patients with established brain metastases, lapatinib (small molecule TKI) seems particularly active in association with capecitabine. Lapatinib alone is attractive in the prevention setting. Brain metastases from melanoma with BRAF V600E mutations respond to a specific inhibitor, such as vemurafenib. The immunomodulator ipilimumab is also active on brain metastases from melanoma.SummaryThe use of targeted agents in brain metastases from solid tumors is promising. The setting of prevention will be probably expanded in the next years. Well designed clinical trials with proper endpoints are needed.

TI  - The treatment in patients with unresectable locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer: Explorations on hot issues
T2  - CANCER LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The treatment efficacy for patients with unresectable, locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC) stagnated for a long time until the advent of immunotherapy. Immune checkpoint inhibitors, particularly programmed cell death protein 1/programmed death-ligand 1 inhibitors, have thrived, reshaping the treatment landscape for patients with lung cancer. Based on the results of the PACIFIC trial, concurrent chemoradiotherapy followed by durvalumab has become the standard of care for patients with unresectable LA-NSCLC; however, numerous issues are yet to be resolved. Currently, several clinical trials are exploring an optimal treatment paradigm, and we have summarized them for comparison to eliminate barriers. In addition, we discuss better predictive biomarkers, therapeutic options for specific populations, and other challenges to identify directions for future research design.

M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeFor patients with locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC) that progressed after definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT) and durvalumab consolidation therapy, no subsequent standard treatment exists. The type of treatment selected for each timing of disease progression and its efficacy have not been investigated.MethodsWe retrospectively enrolled patients with LA-NSCLC or inoperable NSCLC that progressed after definitive CRT and durvalumab consolidation therapy at 15 Japanese institutions. Patients were classified into the following: Early Discontinuation group (disease progression within 6 months after durvalumab initiation), Late Discontinuation group (disease progression from 7 to 12 months after durvalumab initiation), and Accomplishment group (disease progression from 12 months after durvalumab initiation).ResultsAltogether, 127 patients were analyzed, including 50 (39.4%), 42 (33.1%) and 35 (27.5%) patients from the Early Discontinuation, Late Discontinuation, and Accomplishment groups, respectively. Subsequent treatments were Platinum plus immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) in 18 (14.2%), ICI in 7 (5.5%), Platinum in 59 (46.4%), Non-Platinum in 35 (27.6%), and tyrosine kinase inhibitor in 8 (6.3%) patients. In the Early Discontinuation, Late Discontinuation, and Accomplishment groups, 4 (8.0%), 7 (16.7%), and 7 (20.0%) patients were receiving Platinum plus ICI; 21 (42.0%), 22 (52.4%), and 16 (45.7%) were receiving Platinum, and 20 (40.0%), 8 (19.0%), and 7 (20.0%) were receiving Non-Platinum, respectively. No significant difference in progression-free survival was observed in the timing of disease progression.ConclusionIn patients with LA-NSCLC hat progressed after definitive CRT and durvalumab consolidation therapy, subsequent treatment may change depending on the timing of disease progression.

TI  - Extending Outcomes: Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor-Targeted Monoclonal Antibodies in Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer
T2  - CLINICAL LUNG CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway plays an important part in the formation of many epithelial malignancies and has been the target of intensive drug development. Although the small-molecule EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have an established role as single-agent therapy in the second- or third-line treatment of patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), they have failed to demonstrate any additive benefit when combined with standard cytotoxic chemotherapy. Monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) to EGFR are a distinct class of agents that differ significantly from the TKIs in their interaction with the EGFR pathway. A number of MoAbs targeting EGFR are currently in development and their clinical usefulness in the treatment of NSCLC is discussed, with particular attention given to cetuximab.

M3  - Review
AB  - Cancer immunotherapy has experienced remarkable advances in recent years. Striking clinical responses have been achieved for several types of solid cancers (e.g. melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, bladder cancer and mismatch repair-deficient cancers) after treatment of patients with T-cell checkpoint blockade therapies. These have been shown to be particularly effective in the treatment of cancers with high mutation burden, which places tumour-mutated antigens (neo-antigens) centre stage as targets of tumour immunity and cancer immunotherapy. With current technologies, neo-antigens can be identified in a short period of time, which may support the development of complementary, personalized approaches that increase the number of tumours amenable to immunotherapeutic intervention. In addition to reviewing the state of the art in cancer immunotherapy, we discuss potential avenues that can bring the immunotherapy revolution to a broader patient group including cancers with low mutation burden.

TI  - Immune Checkpoint Inhibition in Non-metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer: Chance for Cure?
T2  - DRUGS
M3  - Review
AB  - Immune checkpoint inhibition of programmed-death receptor 1 (PD-1) or its ligand (PD-L1) has become a standard in the treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, either as monotherapy or in combination. Recently, it could be shown that immunotherapy works as consolidation after chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced disease if the tumours express PD-L1. A significant and meaningful survival benefit for consolidation with durvalumab after chemoradiotherapy compared to chemoradiotherapy alone was observed in the PACIFIC trial. In addition, there is a growing body of evidence that this treatment modality is also effective in a neoadjuvant setting in early stages, whereas the role as adjuvant treatment after surgery needs to be determined. The impact of combination therapies in non-metastatic stages-either neoadjuvant or adjuvant-needs to be evaluated in future trials. It is yet unclear whether PD-L1 and tumour mutational burden are predictive biomarkers as randomised trials are missing.

T2  - EXPERT OPINION ON BIOLOGICAL THERAPY
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction: The potential long term survival gain, related to immune adaptability and memory, the potential activity across multiple tumour types through targeting the immune system, and the opportunity for combinations offered by the unique mechanism of actions and safety profile of these new agents, all support the role of immunotherapy in the cancer treatment pathway or paradigm.Areas covered: The authors discuss the recent advances in the understanding of immunology and antitumor immune responses that have led to the development of new immunotherapies, including monoclonal antibodies that inhibit immune checkpoint pathways, such as Programmed Death-1 (PD-1) and Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte-Associated Antigen 4 (CTLA-4). Currently, two PD-1 inhibitors are available in clinical practice for treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC): nivolumab and pembrolizumab.Expert opinion: Ongoing research will dictate future strategies, including the potential incorporation of immunotherapy in stage dependent treatment settings (early stage locally advanced disease and first line therapy for metastatic disease). Immunotherapy combinations are promising avenues, and careful selection of patients, doses of each agent and information supporting strategies (i.e. concomitant or sequential) is still needed.

TI  - Perioperative Targeted Therapy Or Immunotherapy In Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer
T2  - ONCOTARGETS AND THERAPY
M3  - Review
AB  - Targeted therapy and immunotherapy have changed the treatment modes for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), moving from second-line to first-line treatment and significantly extending patients' survival. Surgery and chemoradiotherapy remain the main treatment options for patients with locally advanced lung cancer, but recurrence and metastasis still occur in some patients. The survival rates of conventional perioperative chemotherapy among NSCLC patients have increased by only 5%. Therefore, more studies have begun to explore targeted and immune neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapies in early-stage and locally advanced NSCLC, and the relevant clinical research data have shown good efficacy and safety profiles. This article summarizes several clinical studies of critical importance.

M3  - Review
AB  - PD-1/PD-L1 play key roles in tumor immune escape and the formation of the tumor microenvironment, and are closely related to the generation and development of tumors. Blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway can reshape the tumor microenvironment or block the formation of the tumor microenvironment and enhance endogenous antitumor immune response. Clinical trials show that the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors has significant advantages. The review briefly describes these basic principles of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway and action mechanism in the treatment of NSCLC. A summary of global PD-1/PD-L1 clinical trials and five PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors approved by FDA, EMA and NMPA for advanced NSCLC were analyzed.

T2  - PNEUMOLOGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Concurrent radiochemotherapy has been established as a treatment standard for patients with inoperable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) since the 1990s. There are potential synergistic effects between radiochemotherapy and immunotherapy. Thus, immune checkpoint inhibitors are increasingly used in patients with metastatic tumors.Objectives. What is the role of radioim-muntherapy in patients with stage III NSCLC?Materials and methods. A semistructured literature search was performed.Results. In this review, the established radiochemotherapy and the current data regarding potential synergisms between radiotherapy and immunotherapy are summarized. In this context, consolidation immunotherapy with durvalumab after chemoradiation offers a significant overall survival benefit as shown by the PACIFIC trial.Conclusion. Immunotherapy with durvalumab as consolidation therapy after concurrent radiochemotherapy represents a new paradigm for patients with stage III NSCLC. This could lead to a rearrangement of the current treatment algorithms for patients with stage III NSCLC, also with respect to surgery. While long-term data are still pending, further clinical studies are currently testing the role of immunotherapy in patients with stage III NSCLC.

TI  - Using Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in Lung Cancer
T2  - ONCOLOGY-NEW YORK
M3  - Review
AB  - Immune checkpoint inhibition using targeted monoclonal antibodies is changing the treatment paradigm for lung cancer. Approval by the US Food and Drug Administration of two anti-programmed death 1 immune checkpoint inhibitors for second-line treatment of advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has led to increased use of these agents in the clinic. Ongoing clinical trials are evaluating the administration of immune checkpoint inhibitors alone or in combination with each other, and in combination with targeted therapy, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy regimens. Other trials are evaluating these monoclonal antibodies in small-cell lung cancer and across a variety of treatment regimens and disease stages in NSCLC. Ongoing translational work to identify relevant biomarkers will deepen our understanding of when and how to use immune checkpoint agents in our patients with lung cancer. We must continue to improve the cost-benefit ratios for efficacy, safety, and outcomes associated with the use of these medications. This is an exciting time in the field of lung cancer research as we work to understand how best to use this novel class of agents.

TI  - Update 2021: Management of Small Cell Lung Cancer
T2  - LUNG
M3  - Review
AB  - Background Accounting for 14% of lung cancer, small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly aggressive neuroendocrine malignancy with rapid proliferation, early spread, and poor survival. Aim and Methods We provide an overview of recent advances regarding SCLC pathogenesis, subtypes, and treatment development through literature review of key trials. Results There are no validated biomarkers or approved targeted treatments for this overly heterogeneous disease, but recent analyses have identified some promising targets and four major subtypes which may carry unique therapeutic vulnerabilities in SCLC. Treatment wise, only a third of patients present with limited stage SCLC, which can be managed with a combined modality approach with curative intent (usually chemo-radiotherapy, but in some eligible patients, surgery followed by systemic treatment). For advanced or extensive stage SCLC, combined chemotherapy (platinum-etoposide) and immunotherapy (atezolizumab or durvalumab during and after chemotherapy) has become the new standard front-line treatment, with modest improvement in overall survival. In the second-line setting, for disease relapse <= 6 months, topotecan, lurbinectedin, and clinical trials are reasonable treatment options; for disease relapse > 6 months, original regimen, topotecan or lurbinectedin can be considered. Moreover, Trilaciclib, a CD4/CD6 inhibitor, was recently FDA-approved to decrease the incidence of chemotherapy-related myelosuppression in SCLC patients. Conclusions While modest improvements in survival have been made especially in the metastatic setting with chemo-immunotherapy, further research in understanding the biology of SCLC is warranted to develop biomarker-driven therapeutic strategies and combinational approaches for this aggressive disease.

T2  - CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - From Nov. 1976 to Nov. 1978, the Southwest Oncology Group [USA] treated 254 patients with extensive (metastatic) small cell carcinoma of the lung with combination chemotherapy [cytoxan, vincristine, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide] and radiotherapy with and without BCG immunotherapy. Patients receiving BCG achieved a response rate of 50% vs. those patients not receiving BCG of 46% (P = 0.704). Response duration was 20 wk for the BCG arms and 23 wk for the no-BCG arms; survival was 28 wk for the BCG arms vs. 29 wk for the no-BCG arms. An adverse effect in patients surviving more than 1 yr was detected; those continuing to receive BCG had significantly shorter survival, 60 wk vs. 85 wk (P = 0.019). Toxicities of the programs were not affected by the addition of BCG immunotherapy. BCG immunotherapy probably has no beneficial effect on response rate or duration of response in programs using chemotherapy and radiotherapy for control of metastatic small cell carcinoma of the lung. Because of the adverse effect on long-term survival, the addition of BCG immunotherapy as a treatment modality in this tumor type is not recommended.

TI  - Rationale and design of a phase II trial of durvalumab treatment in patients with NSCLC ineligible for stage III chemoradiotherapy following radiation monotherapy (SPIRAL-RT study)
T2  - THERAPEUTIC ADVANCES IN MEDICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background:In the PACIFIC study, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients with unresectable, locally advanced, stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were prolonged by durvalumab as maintenance therapy after radical concurrent chemoradiotherapy using platinum-based antitumor agents. However, no data were obtained to reveal the efficacy of durvalumab after radiation monotherapy in patients unsuitable for chemoradiotherapy. Here, we describe an ongoing single-arm, prospective, open-label, multicenter phase II trial of durvalumab in patients with NSCLC ineligible for stage III chemoradiotherapy following radiation monotherapy (SPIRAL-RT study).Methods:Durvalumab at 10 mg/kg body weight is administered every 2 weeks after radiation therapy until individual patients meet the discontinuation criteria. The treatment duration is up to 12 months. The primary endpoint is the 1-year PFS rate. Secondary endpoints are response rate, PFS, OS, and safety. Durvalumab treatment after radiation monotherapy is expected to prolong 1-year PFS rate and have acceptable adverse events.Discussion:We are conducting an intervention study to investigate the safety and efficacy of durvalumab treatment in patients with NSCLC ineligible for stage III chemoradiotherapy following radiation monotherapy.

TI  - A retrospective real-world experience of immunotherapy in patients with extensive stage small-cell lung cancer
T2  - CANCER MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The treatment of extensive stage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) has only made modest progress in the past decade, with two immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), atezolizumab and durvalumab, approved for the treatment of SCLC by January 2022. However, currently, there is limited real-world data on ES-SCLC patients received immunotherapy.Methods: We retrospectively collected and analyzed the demographic and treatment data of ES-SCLC patients at the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University from January 2017 to January 2022. Survival and prognosis information was obtained through follow-up.Results: A total of 353 ES-SCLC patients were included, of which 165 received immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy as the first-line (FL) treatment (chemo-immune group), and 188 received chemotherapy (chemotherapy group). The objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) of patients receiving immunotherapy as the FL treatment were better than the chemotherapy group (76.97% vs. 48.40%, p < 0.001, and 83.03% vs. 68.09%, p < 0.001). Moreover, the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of ES-SCLC patients receiving immunotherapy as the FL treatment were better than the chemotherapy group (6.7 months vs. 5.1 months, p < 0.001, and 12.5 months vs. 11.2 months, p < 0.001). Furthermore, the OS of ES-SCLC patients who received immunotherapy as second-line treatment was better than that in the chemotherapy group (15.9 months vs. 12.9 months, p = 0.036).Conclusion: ICIs combined with chemotherapy as the FL treatment could be beneficial to the ORR, DCR, PFS, and OS of ES-SCLC patients. Furthermore, ES-SCLC patients can benefit from ICIs in the second-line treatment, even if they had not received ICIs in the FL treatment.

TI  - Rethinking pulmonary toxicity in advanced non-small cell lung cancer in the era of combining anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy with thoracic radiotherapy
T2  - BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-REVIEWS ON CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - The combination of programmed cell death 1/programmed cell death ligand 1 blockade and thoracic radiotherapy has become the new standard of care in the treatment of locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. The information regarding the pulmonary safety of such therapy remains limited to mostly retrospective studies and case reports with a small portion of data from prospective clinical trials. By analyzing the underlying mechanisms of interactions between radiation and immunotherapy from preclinical data and summarizing safety data from relevant clinical studies with pulmonary toxicity, we believe that longer and rigorous follow-up is warranted, to determine if the combination of such modalities is appropriate for patients without risking undue toxicity.

T2  - CHEST
M3  - Article
AB  - The Lung Cancer Study Group has performed a number of postoperative adjuvant trials in patients with resectable non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Adjuvant cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (CAP) chemotherapy was compared with immunotherapy in the treatment of 130 patients with stage II or III adenocarcinoma or large cell undifferentiated carcinoma. Careful intraoperative staging was performed in all patients. Disease-free interval was significantly prolonged in the chemotherapy group (p = 0.032). After 7.5 years of follow-up, the difference in time to recurrence and cancer deaths remains statistically significant. Another study compared CAP chemotherapy plus radiotherapy with radiotherapy alone in advanced stages II and III resected NSCLC. Again, the chemotherapy arm had significantly increased disease-free survival. In a third study, patients with high-risk stage I NSCLC were randomized after surgery to CAP chemotherapy or observation. In this study there was no difference in recurrence-free survival or overall survival.

TI  - Immunotherapy and lung cancer: current developments and novel targeted therapies
T2  - IMMUNOTHERAPY
M3  - Review
AB  - Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a highly prevalent and aggressive disease. In the metastatic setting, major advances include the incorporation of immunotherapy and targeted therapies into the clinician's therapeutic armamentarium. Standard chemotherapeutic regimens have long been reported to interfere with the immune response to the tumor; conversely, antitumor immunity may add to the effects of those therapies. The aim of immunotherapy is to specifically enhance the immune response directed to the tumor. Recently, many trials addressed the role of such therapies for metastatic NSCLC treatment: ipilimumab, tremelimumab, nivolumab and lambrolizumab are immunotherapeutic agents of main interest in this field. In addition, anti-tumor vaccines, such as MAGE-A3, Tecetomide, TG4010, CIMAvax, ganglioside vaccines, tumor cell vaccines and dendritic cell vaccines, emerged as potent inducers of immune response against the tumor. The current work aims to address the most recent developments regarding these innovative immunotherapies and their implementation in the treatment of metastatic NSCLC.

AB  - Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is characterized by its exquisite sensitivity to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Despite dramatic tumor shrinkage, however, patients are rarely cured and median survival is less than I year for most patients who present with extensive-stage disease (ED) and 18 months for patients with limited-stage disease (LD). Other articles in this issue have detailed current strategies to improve survival by evaluating new cytotoxic agents and radiotherapy techniques. Meanwhile, our growing understanding of the biology of SCLC provides additional targets to exploit for therapeutic benefit [1]. Table I lists molecular abnormalities and their frequency in SCLC [2-24]. In this article, the authors review the current status of biologically targeted agents directed toward several of these abnormalities.

TI  - Clinical and radiation dose-volume factors related to pneumonitis after treatment with radiation and durvalumab in locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer
T2  - INVESTIGATIONAL NEW DRUGS
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Durvalumab has been shown to confer a survival benefit after definitive chemoradiotherapy in the patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer, but no studies have attempted to identify risk factors for pneumonitis after durvalumab therapy. The purpose of this study was to investigate associations between clinical and radiation dose-volume factors, and the severity of pneumonitis. Methods We retrospectively assessed the cases of 30 patients who had been started on durvalumab therapy between July 2018 and February 2019. In this study we evaluated the percentage of lung volume receiving radiation dose in excess of 20 Gy (V20) as radiation dose-volume factor. We compared V20 and some baseline factors between a grade 0 or 1 (Gr 0/1) pneumonitis group and a grade 2 or more (>= Gr 2) pneumonitis group, and we performed a logistic regression analysis to establish the associations between variables and >= Gr 2 pneumonitis. Results Pneumonitis had developed in 22 patients (73.3%): Gr 1/2/3-5 in 8 (26.7%)/14 (46.7%) /0 (0%), respectively. The difference in V20 between the Gr 0/1 group and Gr 2 group (median: 20.5% vs. 23.5%, p = 0.505) was not statistically significant, and thus V20 was not a risk factor for Gr 2 pneumonitis (odds ratio: 1.047, p = 0.303). None of the clinical factors, including sex, age, smoking history, presence of baseline pneumonitis, type of radiation therapy, location of lesion and facility, were risk factors. Conclusions Our study suggest that the severity of pneumonitis after durvalumab is unrelated to V20 or any of the clinical factors assessed in this study.

TI  - Targeted cancer therapy using radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies
T2  - TECHNOLOGY IN CANCER RESEARCH & TREATMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) combines the advantages of targeted radiation therapy and specific immunotherapy using monoclonal antibodies. RIT can be used either to target tumor cells or to specifically suppress immunocompetent host cells in the setting of allogeneic transplantation. The choice of radionuclide used for RIT depends on its distinct radiation characteristics and the type of malignancy or cells targeted. Beta-emitters with their lower, energy and longer path length are more suitable to target bulky, solid tumors whereas alpha-emitters with their high linear energy transfer and short path length are better suited to target hematopoietic cells (normal or malignant). Different approaches of RIT such as the use of stable radioimmunoconjugates or of pretargeting strategies are available. Encouraging results have been obtained with RIT in patients with hematologic malignancies. The results in solid tumors are somewhat less favorable but new strategies for patients with minimal residual disease using adjuvant and locoregional treatment are evolving. This report outlines basic principles of RIT, gives an overview of available radionuclides and radioimmunoconjugates, and discusses clinical results with special emphasis on their use in hematologic malignancies including use in conditioning regimens for bone marrow transplantation.

TI  - Osimertinib after Chemoradiotherapy in Stage III <i>EGFR</i>-Mutated NSCLC
T2  - NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Osimertinib is a recommended treatment for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation and as adjuvant treatment for resected EGFR-mutated NSCLC. EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors have shown preliminary efficacy in unresectable stage III EGFR-mutated NSCLC. Methods In this phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we randomly assigned patients with unresectable EGFR-mutated stage III NSCLC without progression during or after chemoradiotherapy to receive osimertinib or placebo until disease progression occurred (as assessed by blinded independent central review) or the regimen was discontinued. The primary end point was progression-free survival as assessed by blinded independent central review. Results A total of 216 patients who had undergone chemoradiotherapy were randomly assigned to receive osimertinib (143 patients) or placebo (73 patients). Osimertinib resulted in a significant progression-free survival benefit as compared with placebo: the median progression-free survival was 39.1 months with osimertinib versus 5.6 months with placebo, with a hazard ratio for disease progression or death of 0.16 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.10 to 0.24; P<0.001). The percentage of patients who were alive and progression free at 12 months was 74% (95% CI, 65 to 80) with osimertinib and 22% (95% CI, 13 to 32) with placebo. Interim overall survival data (maturity, 20%) showed 36-month overall survival among 84% of patients with osimertinib (95% CI, 75 to 89) and 74% with placebo (95% CI, 57 to 85), with a hazard ratio for death of 0.81 (95% CI, 0.42 to 1.56; P=0.53). The incidence of adverse events of grade 3 or higher was 35% in the osimertinib group and 12% in the placebo group; radiation pneumonitis (majority grade, 1 to 2) was reported in 48% and 38%, respectively. No new safety concerns emerged. Conclusions Treatment with osimertinib resulted in significantly longer progression-free survival than placebo in patients with unresectable stage III EGFR-mutated NSCLC.

TI  - Rationale and design of a phase II trial of durvalumab treatment in patients with NSCLC ineligible for stage III chemoradiotherapy following radiation monotherapy (SPIRAL-RT study).
T2  - Therapeutic advances in medical oncology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the PACIFIC study, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients with unresectable, locally advanced, stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were prolonged by durvalumab as maintenance therapy after radical concurrent chemoradiotherapy using platinum-based antitumor agents. However, no data were obtained to reveal the efficacy of durvalumab after radiation monotherapy in patients unsuitable for chemoradiotherapy. Here, we describe an ongoing single-arm, prospective, open-label, multicenter phase II trial of durvalumab in patients with NSCLC ineligible for stage III chemoradiotherapy following radiation monotherapy (SPIRAL-RT study).METHODS: Durvalumab at 10mg/kg body weight is administered every 2weeks after radiation therapy until individual patients meet the discontinuation criteria. The treatment duration is up to 12months. The primary endpoint is the 1-year PFS rate. Secondary endpoints are response rate, PFS, OS, and safety. Durvalumab treatment after radiation monotherapy is expected to prolong 1-year PFS rate and have acceptable adverse events.DISCUSSION: We are conducting an intervention study to investigate the safety and efficacy of durvalumab treatment in patients with NSCLC ineligible for stage III chemoradiotherapy following radiation monotherapy.

TI  - Curative-Intent Treatment with Durvalumab in Early-Stage Cancers
T2  - ADVANCES IN THERAPY
M3  - Review
AB  - The introduction of immunotherapy has fundamentally transformed the treatment landscape in cancer, providing long-term survival benefit for patients with advanced disease across multiple tumor types, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In the placebo-controlled phase 3 PACIFIC trial, the PD-L1 inhibitor durvalumab demonstrated significant improvements in progression-free survival and overall survival in patients with unresectable, stage III NSCLC who had not progressed after platinum-based chemoradiotherapy (CRT). These findings have led to the widespread acceptance of the 'PACIFIC regimen' (durvalumab after CRT) as the standard of care in this setting. Moreover, the PACIFIC trial is the first study to demonstrate a proven survival advantage with an immunotherapy in a curative-intent setting, thereby providing a strong rationale for further investigation of durvalumab in early-stage cancers. Herein, we describe the extensive clinical development program for durvalumab across multiple tumor types in curative-intent settings, outlining the scientific rationale(s) for its use and highlighting the innovative research (e.g., personalized cancer monitoring) advanced by these trials.

TI  - Chemoradiotherapy in Cancer Treatment: Rationale and Clinical Applications
T2  - ANTICANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Chemoradiotherapy (CRT) refers to the combined administration of both chemotherapy and radiotherapy as an anticancer treatment. Over the years, CRT has become an established treatment for a diverse range of locally advanced solid tumours. The rationale for CRT is based on the two concepts of spatial cooperation and in-field cooperation, whereby the end goal is to achieve synergistic antitumour effects from the combination of both treatment modalities. CRT offers notable patient survival benefits and local disease control without significant long-term toxicities. Although the enhancement of cytotoxic effects inevitably increases damage to normal tissues as well as tumour cells, if the damage to normal tissue is lesser than that to tumour cells, CRT is still deemed beneficial. Thus, the search to optimise dose, timings and fractionation of CRT is of particular interest. Considering the recent success achieved with anticancer immunotherapies including immune checkpoint inhibitors, the combination of CRT and immunotherapy has emerged as an exciting field of research with the potential for significant clinical benefit. This report outlines the rationale underlying CRT and discusses its advantages through clinical examples focusing on anal, cervical, non-small-cell lung cancer and bladder cancer.

TI  - Anti PD-L1 combined with other agents in non-small cell lung cancer: combinations with non-immuno-oncology agents
T2  - EXPERT REVIEW OF RESPIRATORY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related deaths in the world. Despite recent advances, the estimated 5-year overall survival is only around 17%. There is an urgent need for development of new effective drug strategies for the treatment of advanced-stage lung cancer.Areas covered: This review focuses on ongoing research in immune and non-immune oncology combinations for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Here, we will focus on the combination of PD-L1 inhibitors (immunotherapy) with chemotherapy, vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors, targeted therapies, and radiation.Expert commentary: Immunotherapy is a major advancement in the treatment of NSCLC due to its durable responses and overall favorable toxicity profile. However, these responses are seen in only a subset of patients. Mechanisms of resistance to this therapy continue to emerge. Studies on combination therapies are underway as the therapeutic mechanisms of these established agents are not only distinctly different but also synergistic with immunotherapy. Overall, some benefits have been noted, although associated toxicities have also been shown, and the long-term benefits including overall survival have yet to be determined.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of KN046, a novel bispecific antibody against PD-L1 and CTLA-4, in patients with non-small cell lung cancer who failed platinum-based chemotherapy: a phase II study
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of KN046, a novel recombinant humanised antibody targeting PD-L1 and CTLA-4 in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients after failure or intolerance to platinum-based che-motherapy.Methods: In this multi-centre, open-label phase II clinical trial, patients were enroled after failure or intolerance to platinum-based chemotherapy. KN046 at 3 mg/kg or 5 mg/kg was administered intravenously every 2 weeks. The primary end-point was objective response rate (ORR) evaluated by a blinded independent review committee (BIRC).Results: A total of 30 and 34 patients were included in the 3 mg/kg (cohort A) and 5 mg/kg (cohort B) cohorts. On 31st August 2021, the median follow-up duration was 24.08 months (interquartile [IQR], 22.28, 24.84) and 19.35 months (IQR, 17.25, 20.90) in the 3 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg cohorts, respectively. BIRC-assessed ORRs were 13.3% and 14.7% in the 3 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg cohorts, respectively. Median progression-free survival was 3.68 (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.22-7.29) and 3.68 (95%CI 1.81-7.39) months, while overall survival was 19.70 (95.5%CI 15.44-not estimated [NE]) and 13.04 (95.5%CI 9.86-NE) months, respectively. The most common treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were anaemia (28.1%), hypergly-caemia (26.7%), and infusion-related reactions (26.7%). The incidence rates of grade & GE; 3 TRAEs and TRAEs leading to treatment discontinuation were 42.2% and 14.1%, respectively.Conclusions: Both 3 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg KN046 showed promising efficacy and favourable safety profile for advanced NSCLC after failure or intolerance to previous platinum-based chemotherapy.Trial registration number: NCT03838848 & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Irinotecan and oxaliplatin combination as the first-line treatment for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer
T2  - CANCER CHEMOTHERAPY AND PHARMACOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We conducted a prospective phase II trial of IrOx in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity.Patients with histologically or cytologically proven non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), aged a parts per thousand yen18 years, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-1, at stage IIIB (pleural effusion)/IV or with recurrent disease not suitable for primary surgical treatment, with no palliative chemotherapy or radiotherapy to the chest or immunotherapy or biologic therapy, the presence of measurable disease by RECIST, and who had given signed written informed consent, were eligible. Treatment consisted of irinotecan 65 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 8 and oxaliplatin 130 mg/m(2) on day 1, repeated every 3 weeks.A total of 18 patients were enrolled in June and August 2007, the median age was 59 years (47-73). In total, 71 cycles were administered with a median of 4 cycles per patient (range, 1-6 cycles) and 18 patients were evaluable for treatment response. An independent review of tumor responses gave an overall response rate of 27.7% (CR: 0, PR: 5/18; 95% CI, 7-48.4%) by intent-to-treat analysis. The median overall survival of all patients was 14 months and the median time-to-progression was 4.2 months (95% CI, 1.959-6.441). The most common grade 3/4 toxicities were diarrhea (7% of all cycles) and neutropenia (5.6% of all cycles). Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy occurred in one patient and one patient died due to sepsis.This study suggests that IrOx combination therapy has moderate activity with a tolerable toxicity profile. However, it was not warranted to evaluate further this regimen as first-line treatment for patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC using the current dosages and schedule.

TI  - Risk of on-treatment lymphopenia is associated with treatment outcome and efficacy of consolidation immunotherapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy
T2  - RADIOTHERAPY AND ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and purpose: The ability of the effective dose to immune cells (EDIC) and the pre-radiotherapy (RT) absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) to predict lymphopenia during RT, treatment outcomes, and efficacy of consolidation immunotherapy in patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer was investigated.Methods and materials: Among 517 patients treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy, EDIC was calculated using the mean doses to the lungs, heart, and total body. The patients were grouped according to high and low EDIC and pre-RT ALC, and the correlations with radiation-induced lymphopenia and survival outcomes were determined.Results: Altogether, 195 patients (37.7%) received consolidation immunotherapy. The cutoff values of EDIC and pre-RT ALC for predicting severe lymphopenia were 2.89 Gy and 2.03 x 10(9) cells/L, respectively. The high-risk group was defined as EDIC >= 2.89 Gy and pre-RT ALC < 2.03 x 10(9) cells/L, while the low-risk group as EDIC < 2.89 Gy and pre-RT ALC >= 2.03 x 10(9) cells/L, and the rest of the patients as the intermediate-risk group. The incidences of severe lymphopenia during RT in the high-, intermediate-, and low-risk groups were 90.1%, 77.1%, and 52.3%, respectively (P < 0.001). The risk groups could independently predict both progression-free (P < 0.001) and overall survival (P < 0.001). The high-risk group showed a higher incidence of locoregional and distant recurrence (P < 0.001). Consolidation immunotherapy showed significant survival benefit in the low- and intermediate-risk groups but not in the high-risk group.Conclusions: The combination of EDIC and pre-RT ALC predicted severe lymphopenia, recurrence, and survival. It may potentially serve as a biomarker for consolidation immunotherapy.

TI  - CHEMO-IMMUNOTHERAPY OF SMALL CELL BRONCHOGENIC-CARCINOMA WITH VP-16-213, IFOSFAMIDE, VINCRISTINE, ADRIAMYCIN, AND CORYNEBACTERIUM-PARVUM
T2  - CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Patients (35) with small cell bronchogenic carcinoma (SCBC) received chemoimmunotherapy with VP-16-213, ifosfamide, vincristine, Adriamycin and C. parvum. Of 33 evaluable patients, 26 (79%) responded with complete (55%) or partial (24%) remissions. Complete remissions were more common among patients with limited disease (11/14 patients, 79%) compared with those with extensive disease (7/19 patients, 37%) and among patients who were ambulatory prior to therapy (16/25 patients, 64%) compared with those who were nonambulatory (2/8 patients, 25%). Myelosuppression consisted primarily of neutropenia. Eight percent of the treatment courses in 29% of the patients were associated with hematuria and/or documented episodes of infection during neutropenia. There were 3 deaths possibly related to treatment, in 2 of which there was no evidence of disease at post-mortem examination. Six patients relapsed in the CNS. In 4 instances, CNS relapse was the only site of tumor progression. CNS relapse was more common among evaluable patients who did not receive prophylactic brain irradiation (5/17 patients, 29%, vs. 1/15 patients, 7%; P = 0.23). The median survival duration for all patients was 63 wk, being slightly longer for patients with limited disease than for those with extensive disease (70.9 wk vs. 56 wk; P = 0.18). This was also true for patients who achieved complete rather than partial remissions (71 wk vs. 50 wk; P = 0.09). Patients receiving prophylactic brain irradiation experienced longer survival (100.8 wk vs. 48 wk; P = 0.01).

TI  - Safety and efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade in patients with advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer and brain metastasis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - The presence of brain metastases (BM) is a negative prognostic factor for patients with advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Their incidence seems to be higher in patients with oncogene-driven tumours, especially those with EGFR-mutated or ALK-rearranged tumours. Although targeted treatments demonstrate significant efficacy regarding BM, they only apply to a minority of NSCLC patients. On the other hand, systemic therapies for nononcogenic-driven NSCLC with BM have shown limited clinical benefit. In recent years, immunotherapy alone or combined with chemotherapy has been adopted as a new standard of care in first-line therapy. This approach seems to be beneficial to patients with BM in terms of efficacy and toxicity. Combined immune checkpoint inhibition as well as the combination of immunotherapy and radiation therapy show promising results with significant, but overall acceptable toxicity. A pragmatic approach of allowing enrolment of patients with untreated or symptomatic BM in randomised trials evaluating immune checkpoint inhibitors strategies, possibly coupled with central nervous system-related endpoints may be needed to generate data to refine treatment for this patient population.

TI  - Immune checkpoint inhibitors in lung cancer: current status and future directions.
T2  - Chinese clinical oncology
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - Recently, the immune checkpoint inhibitors that target programmed death 1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) have made a breakthrough in treating advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with the efficacy of approximately 20%; among which, nivolumab has acquired treatment indications in lung squamous cell carcinoma. The inhibitors targeting cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) are also undergoing clinical trials. Researches on immune checkpoint inhibitors have been rapidly implemented in a variety of different types of lung cancer, such as small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and locally advanced NSCLC, and these inhibitors began to be applied in combination with some established treatments, including chemotherapy, targeting therapy and radiotherapy. Undoubtedly, the immune checkpoint inhibitors have become a hot spot in the research and treatment of lung cancer. However, many problems wait to be solved, such as searching for ideal biomarkers, constituting the best criteria for curative effect evaluation, exploring different combination treatment models, and clearly understanding the mechanisms of primary or secondary drug resistance. Along with these problems to be successfully solved, the immune checkpoint inhibitors will have more broad applications in lung cancer therapy.

TI  - Immunotherapy and Vaccination in Surgically Resectable Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
T2  - VACCINES
M3  - Review
AB  - Early-stage NSCLC (stages I and II, and some IIIA diseases) accounts for approximately 30% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cases, with surgery being its main treatment modality. The risk of disease recurrence and cancer-related death, however, remains high among NSCLC patients after complete surgical resection. In previous studies on the long-term follow-up of post-operative NSCLC, the results showed that the five-year survival rate was about 65% for stage IB and about 35% for stage IIIA diseases. Platinum-based chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy has been used as a neoadjuvant therapy or post-operative adjuvant therapy in NSCLC, but the improvement of survival is limited. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have effectively improved the 5-year survival of advanced NSCLC patients. Cancer vaccination has also been explored and used in the prevention of cancer or reducing disease recurrence in resected NSCLC. Here, we review studies that have focused on the use of immunotherapies (i.e., ICIs and vaccination) in surgically resectable NSCLC. We present the results of completed clinical trials that have used ICIs as neoadjuvant therapies in pre-operative NSCLC. Ongoing clinical trials investigating ICIs as neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapies are also summarized.

TI  - Immunotherapy in thoracic oncology: state of the art and perspectives
T2  - BULLETIN DU CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) are monoclonal antibodies that inhibit molecular interaction between an immune checkpoint and its ligand, which leads to increased anti-tumoral immune response, Programmed Death 1 (PD-1) and Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Associated-4 (CTLA-4) are the most commonly known immune checkpoints.ICIs are currently placed early in the course of the treatment of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In France, approvals have been pronounced for nivolumab and pembrolizumab anti-PD-1 antibodies) as second-line treatments after chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC, and pembrolizumab has been approved as a first-line treatment in patients with advanced NSCLC, without EGFR mutation or ALK rearrangement, with strong (>= 50%) PD-L1 (Programmed Death Ligand 1) expression. Atezolizumab is currently soon to be approved as a second-line treatment.Numerous studies are currently evaluating ICIs in thoracic oncology. In this article, we will develop perspectives regarding ICIs for early stage or locally advanced NSCLCs, ICIs used in other thoracic cancers (small cell lung cancer, malignant pleural mesothelioma, thymic epithelial tumors), and trials with combinations involving ICIs: two ICIs combined, or 10s combined with chemotherapy, radiotherapy or other anti-cancer treatments.

TI  - Leptomeningeal metastases from non- small cell lung cancer: state of the art and recent advances
T2  - JOURNAL OF CANCER METASTASIS AND TREATMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Patients with leptomeningeal metastases (LM) from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have a poor outcome with survival of less than 1 year regardless of advancements in treatment strategy. In the past, some randomized clinical trials have been conducted with heterogeneous inclusion criteria, diagnostic parameters, response evaluation and primary endpoints. Efforts to develop a standardized magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessment and liquid biopsy techniques to monitor disease evolution in plasma or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are underway. This review aims to cover the main clinical and diagnostic challenges of LM from NSCLC, in particular the role of MRI, CSF cytology and liquid biopsy for the diagnosis and monitoring of the disease, as well as the most recent clinical trials on targeted therapies. Targeted therapy, such as epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors and anaplastic lymphoma kinase rearranged inhibitors, represent a feasible treatment with encouraging results in terms of disease control and survival. For ineligible patients, immune checkpoint inhibitors could represent a therapeutic option with acceptable tolerance, although clinical trials focused on LM from NSCLC are lacking and represent a research focus for the future.

TI  - Immuno-oncology combinations: raising the tail of the survival curve
T2  - CANCER BIOLOGY & MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - There have been exponential gains in immuno-oncology in recent times through the development of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Already approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for advanced melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer, immune checkpoint inhibitors also appears to have significant antitumor activity in multiple other tumor types. An exciting component of immunotherapy is the durability of antitumor responses observed, with some patients achieving disease control for many years. Nevertheless, not all patients benefit, and efforts should thus now focus on improving the efficacy of immunotherapy through the use of combination approaches and predictive biomarkers of response and resistance. There are multiple potential rational combinations using an immunotherapy backbone, including existing treatments such as radiotherapy, chemotherapy or molecularly targeted agents, as well as other immunotherapeutics. The aim of such antitumor strategies will be to raise the tail on the survival curve by increasing the number of long term survivors, while managing any additive or synergistic toxicities that may arise with immunotherapy combinations. Rational trial designs based on a clear understanding of tumor biology and drug pharmacology remain paramount. This article reviews the biology underpinning immuno-oncology, discusses existing and novel immunotherapeutic combinations currently in development, the challenges of predictive biomarkers of response and resistance and the impact of immuno-oncology on early phase clinical trial design.

TI  - Real-world evaluation of atezolizumab and etoposide-carboplatin as a first-line treatment for extensive-stage small cell lung cancer
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF INTERNAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background/Aims: Despite the obvious benefits of adding immune checkpoint inhibitors to platinum-etoposide chemotherapy in patients with extensive-stage small- cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC), real-world data remain scarce.Methods: This retrospective study included 89 patients with ES-SCLC treated with platinum-etoposide chemotherapy alone (chemo- only group; n = 48) or in combination with atezolizumab (atezolizumab group; n = 41) and compared the survival outcomes between these two groups.Results: Overall survival (OS) was significantly longer in the atezolizumab group than in the chemo- only group (15.2 months vs. 8.5 months; p = 0.047), whereas the median progression-free survival was almost the same (5.1 months vs. 5.0 months) in both groups (p = 0.754). Subsequent multivariate analysis revealed that thoracic radiation ( hazard ratio [HR], 0.223; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.092- 0.537; p = 0.001) and atezolizumab administration (HR, 0.350; 95% CI, 0.184-0.668; p = 0.001) were favorable prognostic factors for OS. In the thoracic radiation subgroup, patients who received atezolizumab demonstrated favorable survival outcomes and no grade 3-4 adverse events (AEs).Conclusions: The addition of atezolizumab to platinum-etoposide resulted in favorable outcomes in this real-world study. Thoracic radiation was associated with improved OS and acceptable AE risk in combination with immunotherapy in patients with ES-SCLC.

T2  - JAPANESE JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The superior efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer has inspired many clinical trials to use immune checkpoint inhibitors in earlier stages of lung cancer worldwide. Based on the theoretical feasibility that neoantigens derived from a tumor tissue are present in vivo, some clinical trials have recently evaluated the neoadjuvant, rather than the adjuvant, use of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Some of these trials have already produced evidence on the safety and efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors in a neoadjuvant setting, with a favorable major pathologic response and few adverse events. In the most impactful report from Johns Hopkins University and the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, the programed death-1 inhibitor nivolumab was administered to 21 patients in a neoadjuvant setting. The authors reported a major pathologic response rate of 45%, with no unexpected delay of surgery related to the adverse effects of nivolumab. The adjuvant as well as the neoadjuvant administration of immune checkpoint inhibitors has also been considered in various clinical trials, with or without the combined use of chemotherapy or radiotherapy. The development of appropriate biomarkers to predict the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors is also underway. The expression of programed death ligand-1 and the tumor mutation burden are promising biomarkers that have been evaluated in many settings. To establish an appropriate method for using immune checkpoint inhibitors in combination with surgery, the Lung Cancer Surgical Study Group of the Japan Clinical Oncology Group will manage clinical trials using a multimodality treatment, including immune checkpoint inhibitors and surgery.

TI  - Locally Advanced Lung Cancer <i>An Optimal Setting for Vaccines and Other Immunotherapies</i>
T2  - CANCER JOURNAL
M3  - Review
AB  - Lung cancer has traditionally been considered relatively resistant to immunotherapies. However, recent advances in the understanding of tumor-associated antigens, anti-tumor immune responses, and tumor immunosuppression mechanisms have resulted in a number of promising immunomodulatory therapies such as vaccines and checkpoint inhibitors. Locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer is an optimal setting for these treatments because standard therapies such as surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy may enhance anti-tumor immune effects by debulking the tumor, increasing tumor antigen presentation, and promoting T-cell response and trafficking. Clinical trials incorporating immunomodulatory agents into combined modality therapy of locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer have shown promising results. Future challenges include identifying biomarkers to predict those patients most likely to benefit from this approach, radiographic assessment of treatment effects, the timing and dosing of combined modality treatment including immunotherapies, and avoidance of potentially overlapping toxicities.

TI  - Endostar (rh-endostatin) consolidation therapy after sequential chemoradiotherapy in stage III, unresectable lung adenocarcinoma with novel STK11, TP53 and ATM mutations: a case report
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (cCRT) has been predominantly used as the standard therapy for locally advanced or unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with stage III disease. Based on the outstanding results of Phase III Pacific study, Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor consolidation therapy after cCRT without progression disease (PD) has been recommended by National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guideline as standard therapy for these patients. However, not all patients can tolerate a full course of cCRT due to the poor performance status, concurrent complications, or poor pulmonary function. Therefore, sequential chemoradiotherapy (sCRT) is often conducted for these selected patients who have been assessed as not suitable for cCRT. Moreover, not all patients are suitable for immunotherapy, especially for those with auto-immune disease or certain gene mutations associated with non-response of immunotherapy. Hence, we presented a case with both autoimmune disease and serine/threonine kinase 11 (STK11) mutation, who underwent angiogenesis inhibitor Endostar consolidation therapy after sCRT, and achieved a progression-free survival (PFS) more than 17 months and still in the process of follow-up. This case may offer an effective consolidation treatment for these patients with stage III disease unsuitable for immunotherapy. Further clinical trials are required to confirm this treatment option.

TI  - Neoadjuvant immunotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer: State of the art
T2  - CANCER COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Review
AB  - Lung cancer mortality has decreased over the past decade and can be partly attributed to advances in targeted therapy and immunotherapy. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have rapidly evolved from investigational drugs to standard of care for the treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In particular, antibodies that block inhibitory immune checkpoints, such as programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1), have revolutionized the treatment of advanced NSCLC, when administered alone or in combination with chemotherapy. Immunotherapy is associated with higher response rates, improved overall survival (OS), and increased tolerability compared with conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy. These benefits may increase the utility of immunotherapy and its combinational use with chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant treatment of patients with NSCLC. Early findings from various ongoing clinical trials suggest that neoadjuvant ICIs alone or combined with chemotherapy may significantly reduce systemic recurrence and improve long-term OS or cure rates in resectable NSCLC. Here we further summarize the safety and efficacy of various neoadjuvant treatment regimens including immunotherapy from ongoing clinical trials and elaborate the role of neoadjuvant immunotherapy in patients with resectable NSCLC. In addition, we discuss several unresolved challenges, including the evaluations to assess neoadjuvant immunotherapy response, the role of adjuvant treatment after neoadjuvant immunotherapy, the efficacy of treatment for oncogenic-addicted tumors, and predictive biomarkers. We also provide our perspective on ways to overcome current obstacles and establish neoadjuvant immunotherapy as a standard of care.

TI  - A review on epidermal growth factor receptor's role in breast and non-small cell lung cancer
T2  - CHEMICO-BIOLOGICAL INTERACTIONS
M3  - Review
AB  - Epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a cell surface transmembrane receptor that mediates the tyrosine signaling pathway to carry the extracellular messages inside the cell and thereby alter the function of nucleus. This leads to the generation of various protein products to up or downregulate the cellular function. It is encoded by cell erythroblastosis virus oncogene B1, so called C-erb B1/ERBB2/HER-2 gene that acts as a proto-oncogene. It belongs to the HER-2 receptor-family in breast cancer and responds best with anti-Herceptin therapy (anti-tyrosine kinase monoclonal antibody). HER-2 positive breast cancer patient exhibits worse prognosis without Herceptin therapy. Similar incidence and prognosis are reported in other epithelial neoplasms like EGFR + lung non-small cell carcinoma and glioblastoma (grade IV brain glial tumor). Present study highlights the role and connectivity of EGF with various cancers via signaling pathways, cell surface receptors mechanism, macromolecules, mitochondrial genes and neoplasm. Present study describes the EGFR associated gene expression profiling (in breast cancer and NSCLC), relation between mitrochondrial genes and carcinoma, and several in vitro and in vivo models to screen the synergistic effect of various combination treatments. According to this study, although clinical studies including targeted treatments, immunotherapies, radiotherapy, TKi-EGFR combined targeted therapy have been carried out to investigate the synergism of combination therapy; however still there is a gap to apply the scenarios of experimental and clinical studies for further developments. This review will give an idea about the transition from experimental to most advanced clinical studies with different combination drug strategies to treat cancer.

TI  - Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA)-Based Cancer Vaccines: Recent Patents and Antitumor Effects from Experimental Models to Clinical Trials
T2  - RECENT PATENTS ON ANTI-CANCER DRUG DISCOVERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), a glycosylated protein of MW 180 kDa, is overexpressed in a wide range of human carcinomas, including colorectal, gastric, pancreatic, non-small cell lung and breast carcinomas. Accordingly, CEA is one of several oncofetal antigens that may serve as a target for active anti-cancer specific immunotherapy. Experimental results obtained by employing animal models have supported the design of clinical trials using a CEA-based vaccine for the treatment of different types of human cancers. This review reports findings from experimental models and clinical evidence on the use of a CEA-based vaccine for the treatment of cancer patients. Among the diverse CEA-based cancer vaccines, DCs- and recombinant viruses-based vaccines seem the most valid. However, although vaccination was shown to induce a strong immune response to CEA, resulting in a delay in tumor progression and prolonged survival in some cancer patients, it failed to eradicate the tumor in most cases, owing partly to the negative effect exerted by the tumor microenvironment on immune response. Thus, in order to develop more efficient and effective cancer vaccines, it is necessary to design new clinical trials combining cancer vaccines with chemotherapy, radiotherapy and drugs which target those factors responsible for immunosuppression of immune cells. This review also discusses relevant patents relating to the use of CEA as a cancer vaccine.

TI  - Durvalumab for stage III non-small-cell lung cancer patients: clinical evidence and real-world experience
T2  - THERAPEUTIC ADVANCES IN RESPIRATORY DISEASE
M3  - Review
AB  - Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has a dismal prognosis, with only 15-20% of patients alive at 5 years after concomitant chemo-radiotherapy, which represents the standard treatment. Targeting immune-checkpoint inhibitors represents a standard option for advanced NSCLC. Improvements in understanding of the immune profile of NSCLC has led to the development of immunotherapeutic strategies, including inhibitory molecules responsible for abrogating an anticancer immune response such as programmed cell-death 1 and programmed cell-death ligand 1. A recently published phase III trial (PACIFIC) showed for the first time an improved overall survival in stage III NSCLC patients with consolidative durvalumab. The aim of this review is to summarize and discuss the clinical evidence for the use of durvalumab in stage III NSCLC, with a brief overview on future perspectives in this setting.

T2  - ONKOLOGIE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background In Germany, lung cancer is the third most common malignant tumor in women and ranks second in number of cancer-related deaths, while in men it is the second most common cancer and ranks highest in number of cancer-related deaths. In the majority of cases, it is diagnosed at an advanced stage, so that curative therapy is not an option. New therapy options with checkpoint inhibitors can significantly improve the overall very poor prognosis of these patients. Objectives Based on the relevant clinical trials of the last few years, the following article is intended to provide an overview of the current possibilities in immuno-oncological therapy for the treatment of metastatic non-small-cell lung carcinoma without therapy-relevant molecular alterations. In addition, the pathophysiological principles of checkpoint inhibition are briefly explained. Conclusions In first-line therapy, immunochemotherapy, regardless of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, and immunomonotherapy for PD-L1 high-expressing tumors represent the standard of care for metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer of any histology. Dual checkpoint inhibition using PD-1/CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4) inhibitors also offers a chemotherapy-sparing treatment option. In addition to docetaxel + ramucirumab/bevacizumab, checkpoint inhibitors are also used successfully in postprogression therapy. Since biomarker-based criteria for selecting the optimal therapy regimen and sequence for the individual patient are the subject of current research, these decisions can currently only be made clinically.

T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Results of several studies by the Lung Cancer Study Group have shown that postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy enhances survival following surgery for lung cancer. The 18-month disease-free survival almost doubled in one study using cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, cisplatin (CAP) chemotherapy postoperatively. The recurrence rate remained significant, however. Patients with more advanced resectable disease seem to benefit most from postoperative chemotherapy. Results also suggest that CAP delays  recurrences more effectively in patients with nonsquamous vs. squamous lung carcinoma. There has been considerable interest in the use of preoperative adjuvant therapy as well. Findings from studies of preoperative or induction therapy.sbd.either chemotherapy alone or in combination with radiation therapy.sbd.have shown high response rates and that patients with unresectable disease can be converted to technically resectable. Although preoperative therapy can cause difficulties with surgical dissection, surgical morbidity is acceptable. Preoperative chemotherapy and radiotherapy followed by surgical resection clearly eliminates local recurrence. Systemic recurrences remain a significant problem. The evidence, as yet, does not indicate that preoperative adjuvant therapy prolongs survival.

TI  - Cetuximab combined with natural killer cells therapy: an alternative to chemoradiotherapy for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural killer (NK) cells therapy has the potential to prolong survival in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We conducted a clinical trial to investigate the safety and efficacy of cetuximab plus NK cells therapy in patients with advanced NSCLC. Between June 2015 and August 2016, 54 patients with advanced EGFR-expressing NSCLC were assigned randomly to the cetuximab plus NK cells therapy group (A; n = 27) or cetuximab alone group (B; n = 27). Patients in group A received two courses of NK cells therapy continuously. Cetuximab was administered intravenously and the weekly maintenance dose was continued until tumor progression. All adverse effects were manageable and no significant difference was noted between the two groups (P > 0.05). Levels of CEA, NSE and circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in group A were significantly lower than those before treatment (P < 0.05). Patients in group A had a significant improvement in immune function and quality of life (QOL) (P < 0.05). Patients in group A survived longer than those in group B (median PFS: 6 months vs 4.5 months; median OS: 9.5 months vs 7.5 months; P < 0.05). Combination therapy could be an alternative to chemoradiotherapy for patients with advanced NSCLC.

TI  - Pembrolizumab combined with stereotactic body radiotherapy in a patient with human immunodeficiency virus and advanced non-small cell lung cancer: a case report.
T2  - Journal of medical case reports
M3  - Case Reports
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pembrolizumab has significantly improved outcomes in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Combining programmed death-1 inhibitor with stereotactic body radiotherapy showed a slight toxicity and good benefits in recent clinical trials. However, patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus were excluded from most trials because it was assumed that their anti-tumor immunity was compromised compared with immunocompetent patients.CASE PRESENTATION: In June 2016, a 52-year-old Chineseman presented with human immunodeficiency virus and lung adenocarcinoma (T1bN3M1b). From November 2016 to December 2016, systemic chemotherapy and palliative radiotherapy for bone metastasis of femoral neck were carried out, but the tumor progressed. In January 2017, after immunochemistry detection of programmed death-1 and programmed death-ligand 1 expression (both >50%), pembrolizumab was started. Three weeks after pembrolizumab, we combined stereotactic body radiotherapy for the primary lung tumor. He received no comfort and his CD4 lymphocyte count was stable. Human immunodeficiency virus-ribonucleic acid remained below the limits of detection. In March 2017, after threecycles of pembrolizumab and 5weeks of stereotactic body radiotherapy therapy, he suddenly presented with palpitations. Emergency computed tomography scanning showed massive pericardial effusion and interstitial pneumonia. So we interrupted the pembrolizumab use and initiated treatment with prednisolone 1mg/kg; however, the tumor progressed. Then, his CD4 lymphocyte count declined. Finally he died in June 2017 due to dyscrasia.CONCLUSIONS: Pembrolizumab combined with SBRT therapy for patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection and non-small cell lung cancer may lead to serious immune-related adverse events and more clinical trials are needed.

TI  - Real-world prospective analysis of treatment patterns in durvalumab maintenance after chemoradiotherapy in unresectable, locally advanced NSCLC patients
T2  - INVESTIGATIONAL NEW DRUGS
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this prospective study is to evaluate the clinical use and real-world efficacy of durvalumab maintenance treatment after chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in unresectable stage, locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). All consecutive patients with unresectable, locally advanced NSCLC and PD-L1 expression (>= 1%) treated after October 2018 were included. Regular follow up, including physical examination, PET/CT and/or contrast-enhanced CT-Thorax/Abdomen were performed every three months after CRT. Descriptive treatment pattern analyses, including reasons of discontinuation and salvage treatment, were undertaken. Statistics were calculated from the last day of thoracic irradiation (TRT). Twenty-six patients were included. Median follow up achieved 20.6 months (range: 1.9-30.6). Durvalumab was initiated after a median of 25 (range: 13-103) days after completion of CRT. In median 14 (range: 2-24) cycles of durvalumab were applied within 6.4 (range 1-12.7) months. Six patients (23%) are still in treatment and seven (27%) have completed treatment with 24 cycles. Maintenance treatment was discontinued in 13 (50%) patients: 4 (15%) patients developed grade 3 pneumonitis according to CTCAE v5 after a median of 3.9 (range: 0.5-11.6) months and 7 (range: 2-17) cycles of durvalumab. Four (15%) patients developed grade 2 skin toxicity. One (4%) patient has discontinued treatment due to incompliance. Six and 12- month progression-free survival (PFS) rates were 82% and 62%, median PFS was not reached. No case of hyperprogression was documented. Eight (31%) patients have relapsed during maintenance treatment after a median of 4.8 (range: 2.2-11.3) months and 11 (range: 6-17) durvalumab cycles. Two patients (9%) developed a local-regional recurrence after 14 and 17 cycles of durvalumab. Extracranial distant metastases and brain metastases as first site of failure were detected in 4 (15%) and 2 (8%) patients, respectively. Three (13%) patients presented with symptomatic relapse. Our prospective study confirmed a favourable safety profile of durvalumab maintenance treatment after completion of CRT in unresectable stage, locally advanced NSCLC in a real-world setting. In a median follow-up time of 20.6 months, durvalumab was discontinued in 27% of all patients due to progressive disease. All patients with progressive disease were eligible for second-line treatment.

TI  - Boosting Abscopal Response to Radiotherapy with Sargramostim: A Review of Data and Ongoing Studies
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Drug development in oncology today routinely focuses on approaches that utilize the patients' immune system to destroy the malignancy. Combinatorial approaches of antineoplastic agents, both new and old, are being incorporated in the armamentarium of cancer treatments. The overarching goal of therapy remains the achievement of a complete and durable response with long term remission or cure. One approach in advancing treatment is aimed at strategies that improve immunological memory to induce long lasting immunity against the tumor. Although radiation therapy has not traditionally been thought to elicit an immunological effect, an increasing number of reports document the induction of an immune response against a tumor that kills cancer cells distant to the original site of treatment after local irradiation to a tumor. This phenomenon is called an abscopal effect. Since radiation alone is rarely associated with such a response, it is being combined with immuno-oncology drugs in an attempt to enhance response. One such strategy combines sargramostim, a recombinant human granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (rhu GM-CSF), with radiotherapy. GM-CSF is a cytokine secreted by multiple cells types that promotes maturation of dendritic cells and enables the presentation of tumor-associated antigens to generate a T-cell response. This review article discusses the outcomes of clinical trials and case reports examining the efficacy and safety of combining radiation therapy with this immunomodulatory agent. We will also examine future studies and challenges facing the translation of this therapeutic approach.

TI  - The Promise of Neoadjuvant Immunotherapy and Surgery for Cancer Treatment
T2  - CLINICAL CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Cancer immunotherapies utilizing immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have demonstrated durable efficacy in a proportion of patients with advanced/metastatic cancers. More recently, the use of ICIs for the adjuvant treatment of patients with surgically resectable melanoma has also demonstrated efficacy by improving relapse-free survival and in the case of ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4) also improving overall survival. Although promising, the effective scheduling of surgery and immunotherapy and its duration is not well elucidated. Recent preclinical studies suggest that surgery followed by adjuvant therapy might be suboptimal as compared with an approach in which immunotherapy is applied before surgery (neoadjuvant immunotherapy). Encouraging findings from early-phase clinical trials in melanoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma, and glioblastoma support the idea that neoadjuvant immunotherapy might have improved clinical efficacy over an adjuvant application. In this review, we discuss the existing rationale for the use of neoadjuvant immunotherapy, its apparent strengths and weaknesses, and implications for the design of future clinical trials.

TI  - The Evolving Role of Targeted Therapy in Early-Stage and Locally Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
T2  - CURRENT ONCOLOGY REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Many of the leading developments in management of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have been provided by the integration of specific targeted therapies either in combination with a backbone of standard chemotherapy or as a single agent. Agents that inhibit a specific pathway, such as that triggered by the activity of the epidermal growth factor receptor, or a regulatory process like angiogenesis, have made it possible to markedly increase response rates and extend survival, sometimes dramatically, along with a favorable therapeutic index. However, these novel therapies have established clinical benefit thus for only in the setting of incurable, advanced NSCLC. The value of these strategies in not only extending survival but potentially improving the cure rate when added to, or substituting for, conventional chemotherapy in the setting of early-stage resectable NSCLC or locally advanced NSCLC remains to be determined. A wide range of clinical trials for these settings have been pursued, with several pivotal studies still ongoing, and will be reviewed for their potential to redefine our current standards of care for potentially curable NSCLC through the integration of targeted therapies.

TI  - Current status of and future strategies for multimodality treatment of unresectable stage III nonsmall cell lung cancer
T2  - EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Stage III nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) encompasses a heterogeneous group of patients, some of whom may be candidates for potentially curative surgery, although for the majority surgery is not an option. Recommended therapy for patients with unresectable stage III disease is concurrent treatment with chemotherapy and thoracic radiotherapy, although even with this dual modality therapy survival remains disappointing. Novel classes of agents including targeted therapies have been shown to improve survival in advanced stage NSCLC, raising the possibility that these agents may have benefits in multimodal therapy when combined with chemoradiotherapy. Here we consider the rationale for combining new agents with chemoradiotherapy and the evidence from clinical studies assessing multimodal strategies for the management of patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC.

TI  - A randomized trial of adoptive immunotherapy with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and interleukin-2 versus standard therapy in the postoperative treatment of resected nonsmall cell lung carcinoma
T2  - CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - BAGKGROUND. A previous pilot study from our group suggested that: (1) adoptive immunotherapy (Al) with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) and recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2) may be applied with safety to more than 80% of the patients who had surgery for Stage TIT nonsmall cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC); and (2) AI could be useful in patients with locally advanced disease. The present randomized study was planned to assess the efficacy of AI in the postoperative treatment of Stage II, IIIa, or mb NSCLC.METHODS. TIL were expanded in vitro from tissue samples obtained from the surgically removed specimens of 131 patients. Eighteen cultures yielded no growth of TIL. The remaining 113 patients were stratified according to disease stage and randomized to receive Al or standard chemoradiotherapy. TIL were infused intravenously 6 to 8 weeks after surgery. rIL-2 was administered subcutaneously at escalating doses for 2 weeks, and then at reduced doses for 2 weeks and then for 2 to 3 months.RESULTS. Three-year survival was significantly better (P < 0.05) for patients who underwent AI than for controls. Al was of no benefit to patients with Stage II NSCLC, potentially useful to patients with Stage IIIa NSCLC (P = 0.06), and significantly advantageous to patients with Stage mb (T4) NSCLC (P < 0.01). For patients with Stage III NSCLC, local relapse (but not distant relapse) was significantly reduced following Al (P < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS. AI should be considered when designing future adjuvant therapy protocols for the treatment of NSCLC. (C) 1996 American Cancer Society.

TI  - Atezolizumab and stereotactic body radiotherapy in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer: safety, clinical activity and ctDNA responses-the ComIT-1 trial
T2  - MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The introduction of immune checkpoint inhibitors has transformed the treatment landscape of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. However, challenges remain to increase the fraction of patients achieving durable clinical responses to these drugs and to help monitor the treatment effect. In this phase II trial, we investigated the toxicity, systemic responses and circulating tumour DNA responses in patients (n = 21) with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer treated with atezolizumab and stereotactic body radiotherapy in the second or later line. We found the combined treatment to be safe with grade 3 toxicity reported in three patients. As the best overall response, four patients had a partial response, eight had stable disease and five had progressive disease. Median overall survival time was still not reached after a median follow-up of 26.5 months and 10/15 patients with programmed death-ligand 1 negative tumours were alive >18 months after the start of the study treatment. ctDNA was detectable at baseline in 11 patients. A rapid decline in ctDNA to <30% of baseline levels was seen in three patients, two of which were radiographic responders and one was considered clinically benefiting from therapy for almost 1 year.

T2  - EXPERT REVIEW OF ANTICANCER THERAPY
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction: Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a very aggressive disease characterized by a high response rate to first-line chemotherapy, but most patients relapse within 1year with disappointing results to second-line treatments. Chemotherapy has reached a plateau of effectiveness and new therapeutic strategies are needed to change the natural history of SCLC.Areas covered: This review will focus on the current results and the future development of the therapeutic approaches for the treatment of SCLC.Expert commentary: Immunotherapy is becoming a new frontier for the management of SCLC with preliminary interesting results. To date, no targeted drugs have been approved for clinical practice but several novel agents are in an advanced stage of clinical development in SCLC.

TI  - Progress of immune checkpoint inhibitors therapy fornon-small cell lung cancer with liver metastases
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - Nearly one-fifth of patients with non-small cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) will develop liver metastases (LMs), and the overall treatment strategy of LMs will directly affect the survival of patients. However, some retrospective studies have found that patients receiving chemotherapy or targeted therapy have a poorer prognosis once LMs develop. In recent years, multiple randomised controlled trials (RCTS) have shown significant improvements in outcomes for patients with advanced lung cancer following the introduction of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) compared to conventional chemotherapy. ICIs is safe and effective in patients with LMs, although patients with LMs are mostly underrepresented in randomised clinical trials. However, NSCLC patients with LMs have a significantly worse prognosis than those without LMs when treated with ICIs, and the mechanism by which LMs induce systemic anti-tumour immunity reduction is unknown, so the management of LMs in patients with NSCLC is a clinical challenge that requires more optimised therapies to achieve effective disease control. In this review, we summarised the mechanism of ICIs in the treatment of LMs, the clinical research and treatment progress of ICIs and their combination with other therapies in patients with LMs from NSCLC.

TI  - The progress and confusion of anti-PD1/PD-L1 immunotherapy for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer
T2  - INTERNATIONAL IMMUNOPHARMACOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, immunotherapy has evolved into a true treatment modality with the approval of PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors as the standard care for first-line treatment in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Until now, for patients with advanced NSCLC, treatment of targeting immune checkpoints reveals a promising survival benefit, and some patients even get long term survive, which creates a paradigm shift in NSCLC treatment. However, many issues or problems are also appearing in clinical practice, such as the lower overall efficacy rate (20-40%), treatment modes, populations choice of immunotherapy, drug resistance, and safety, etc. Thus, in this review, we will mainly summarize and discuss the recent development and confusion of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors for advanced NSCLC patients based on current clinical studies.

TI  - Modified Glasgow Prognostic Score predicts survival among advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma patients treated with anti-PD1 agents
T2  - ANTI-CANCER DRUGS
M3  - Article
AB  - Immune checkpoint inhibitors were approved for advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treatment. Despite improved survival, not all patients benefit from these agents. Here, the prognostic impact of pretreatment modified Glasgow Prognostic Score (mGPS) and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was assessed. From 77 patients included, 83.2% received at least one prior systemic therapy. Immune-related adverse events (irAE) occurred in 20 patients. A lower mGPS was associated with higher median overall survival (OS), and a lower Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG), irAE and fewer metastatic sites with better survival. A trend towards greater OS and progression-free survival (PFS) was stated among patients with NLR 2 with worse OS and irAE with better survival. Pretreatment mGPS seems to be useful for predicting survival among advanced NSCLC patients treated with anti-programmed cell death 1 drugs, with ECOG performance status, irAE occurrence, and number of metastatic sites acting as survival predictors.

TI  - Novel Cytotoxic Chemotherapies in Small Cell Lung Carcinoma
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Simple SummarySmall cell lung cancer is a subtype of lung cancer and one of the deadliest thoracic tumours. Historically, chemotherapy consisting of either platinum plus etoposide or anthracycline-based regimens have been associated with a high response rate and rapid development of acquired resistance, contributing to the poor overall prognosis. Only a fraction of patients with local or early disease can be cured, whilst the treatment is palliative in those with extensive disease. In recent decades, few novel drugs have been developed, which are herein described.Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is one of the deadliest thoracic neoplasms, in part due to its fast doubling time and early metastatic spread. Historically, cytotoxic chemotherapy consisting of platinum-etoposide or anthracycline-based regimens has demonstrated a high response rate, but early chemoresistance leads to a poor prognosis in advanced SCLC. Only a fraction of patients with limited-disease can be cured by chemo-radiotherapy. Given the disappointing survival rates in advanced SCLC, new cytotoxic agents are eagerly awaited. Unfortunately, few novel chemotherapy drugs have been developed in the latest decades. This review describes the results and potential application in the clinical practice of novel chemotherapy agents for SCLC.

TI  - Immunotherapy as a second-line or later treatment modality for advanced non-small cell lung cancer: A review of safety and efficacy
T2  - CRITICAL REVIEWS IN ONCOLOGY HEMATOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 80-85% of these cases. Surgical resection is the most common conventional treatment of lung cancer. For patients with advanced NSCLC, platinum-based chemotherapy remains the cornerstone of treatment. Although platinum-based chemotherapy demonstrated improved outcomes, the need for the second-line/later therapies is evident. A review was conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of immunotherapies as the second-line/later therapy of advanced NSCLC. Clinical trial data was collected via PubMed and Clinicaltrials.gov. Recent studies were selected based on prespecified inclusion/exclusion criteria. Data on the safety and efficacy of the immunotherapy was subsequently compiled from relevant trials. Monoclonal antibodies targeting PD-1/PD-L1 showed the most promising results as the second-line/later treatment modalities. Immunizations did not produce as robust of an immune response in participants; however, they warrant further research to determine their place in therapy.

TI  - Perspectives on treatment advances for stage III locally advanced unresectable non-small-cell lung cancer
T2  - CURRENT ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - For more than a decade, there has been no improvement in outcomes for patients with unresectable locally advanced (LA) non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The standard treatment in that setting is definitive concurrent chemotherapy and radiation (CCRT). Although the intent of treatment is curative, most patients rapidly progress, and their prognosis is poor, with a 5-year overall survival (OS) rate in the 15%-25% range. Those patients therefore represent a critical unmet need, warranting expedited approval of, and access to, new treatments that can improve outcomes. The pacific trial, which evaluated durvalumab consolidation therapy after CCRT in unresectable la NSCLC, demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) and a significant improvement in OS. Durvalumab thus fills a critical unmet need in the setting of unresectable la NSCLC and provides a new option for patients treated with curative intent. Here, we review the treatment of unresectable la NSCLC, with a focus on the effect of the clinical data for durvalumab.

TI  - Efficacy of chemotherapy after progression with nivolumab in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck
T2  - AURIS NASUS LARYNX
M3  - Article
AB  - Nivolumab, a programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitor, has shown promising results against squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) in cases of recurrence or in a metastatic setting after platinum-based therapy. However, treatment alternatives for patients with nivolumab-refractory are limited, and a constant opinion is not provided.Recently, accumulating studies have demonstrated that chemotherapy after immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment may induce better objective responses in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. However, there are few reports on the increased effect of chemotherapy after nivolumab treatment in SCCHN. Therefore, cases must be accumulated to identify patients with nivolumab-refractory SCCHN who may benefit from chemotherapy.Here, we present patients with SCCHN who exhibited a significant response to chemotherapy after nivolumab treatment.

TI  - Immunotherapy and Radiotherapy for Older Patients with Locally Advanced Non-Metastatic Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer Who Are Not Candidates for or Decline Surgery and Chemotherapy: A Practical Proposal by the International Geriatric Radiotherapy Group
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Older patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer may not be candidates for standard treatment due to their poor performance status. Immunotherapy and radiotherapy are well tolerated and may become the treatment of choice for those patients. This hypothesis should be confirmed in future clinical trials. Abstract The standard of care for locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is either surgery combined with chemotherapy pre- or postoperatively or concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy. However, older and frail patients may not be candidates for surgery and chemotherapy due to the high mortality risk and are frequently referred to radiotherapy alone, which is better tolerated but carries a high risk of disease recurrence. Recently, immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) may induce a high response rate among cancer patients with positive programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression. Immunotherapy is also well tolerated among older patients. Laboratory and clinical studies have reported synergy between radiotherapy and ICI. The combination of ICI and radiotherapy may improve local control and survival for NSCLC patients who are not candidates for surgery and chemotherapy or decline these two modalities. The International Geriatric Radiotherapy Group proposes a protocol combining radiotherapy and immunotherapy based on the presence or absence of PD-L1 to optimize the survival of those patients.

TI  - Nivolumab, anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1) monoclonal antibody immunotherapy: Role in advanced cancers
T2  - HUMAN VACCINES & IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICS
M3  - Review
AB  - The development of immune checkpoint inhibitors has altered the landscape of treatment of advanced cancers. These drugs are well tolerated and have shown clinical activity against a wide variety of solid tumors and hematological malignancies. The durability of response is particularly impressive when compared to other forms of systemic therapy. Nivolumab (Opdivo) is an IgG4 antibody that causes immune checkpoint blockade by diminishing inhibitory signaling through the programmed death receptor-1 pathway. It is approved for treatment of recurrent non-small cell lung cancer, melanoma, and renal cell carcinoma. Efforts to identify biomarkers of response to nivolumab are ongoing. Clinical trials are also being conducted to determine the benefits of combining nivolumab with other forms of treatment including chemotherapy, molecular-targeted therapy, radiation therapy, and other forms of immune therapy. This review outlines the clinical trials that have led to the emergence of nivolumab as a treatment option for patients with advanced cancers.

TI  - Management of Resectable Stage III-N2 Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) in the Age of Immunotherapy
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Simple SummaryThe treatment of resectable stage III non-small-cell lung cancer with N2 lymph node involvement is usually multimodal and is generally based on neoadjuvant chemotherapy +/- radiotherapy followed by surgery, but the cure rate is still low. Immunotherapy based on anti-PD1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors has improved survival in advanced and stage III non-resectable NSCLC patients and is being studied in earlier stages to improve the cure rate of lung cancer. In this article, we review all therapeutic approaches to stage III-N2 NSCLC, analysing both completed and ongoing studies that evaluate the addition of immunotherapy with or without chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy.Stage III non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with N2 lymph node involvement is a heterogeneous group with different potential therapeutic approaches. Patients with potentially resectable III-N2 NSCLC are those who are considered to be able to receive a multimodality treatment that includes tumour resection after neoadjuvant therapy. Current treatment for these patients is based on neoadjuvant chemotherapy +/- radiotherapy followed by surgery and subsequent assessment for adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. In addition, some selected III-N2 patients could receive upfront surgery or pathologic N2 incidental involvement can be found a posteriori during analysis of the surgical specimen. The standard treatment for these patients is adjuvant chemotherapy and evaluation for complementary radiotherapy. Despite being a locally advanced stage, the cure rate for these patients continues to be low, with a broad improvement margin. The most immediate hope for improving survival data and curing these patients relies on integrating immunotherapy into perioperative treatment. Immunotherapy based on anti-PD1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors is already a standard treatment in stage III unresectable and advanced NSCLC. Data from the first phase II studies in monotherapy neoadjuvant therapy and, in particular, in combination with chemotherapy, are highly promising, with impressive improved and complete pathological response rates. Despite the lack of confirmatory data from phase III trials and long-term survival data, and in spite of various unresolved questions, immunotherapy will soon be incorporated into the armamentarium for treating stage III-N2 NSCLC. In this article, we review all therapeutic approaches to stage III-N2 NSCLC, analysing both completed and ongoing studies that evaluate the addition of immunotherapy with or without chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy.

TI  - Improved Survival Associated with Local Tumor Response Following Multisite Radiotherapy and Pembrolizumab: Secondary Analysis of a Phase I Trial
T2  - CLINICAL CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - ASTRO-RSNA Research Workshop on Treatment of Oligometastatic Disease
CL  - Washington, DC
AB  - Purpose: Multisite stereotactic body radiotherapy followed by pembrolizumab (SBRT+P) has demonstrated safety in advanced solid tumors (ASTs). However, no studies have examined the relationships between irradiated tumor response, SBRT-induced tumor gene expression, and overall survival (OS).Patients and Methods: Patients with AST received SBRT (30-50 Gy in 3-5 fractions) to two to four metastases followed by pembrolizumab (200 mg i.v. every 3 weeks). SBRT was prescribed to a maximum tumor volume of 65 mL. Small metastases received the complete prescribed coverage (cornplete-Rx), while larger metastases received partial coverage (partial-Rx). Treated metastasis control (TMC) was defined as a lack of progression for an irradiated metastasis. Landmark analysis was used to assess the relationship between TMC and OS. Thirty-five biopsies were obtained from 24 patients: 19 pre-SBRT and 16 post-SBRT (11 matched) prior to pembrolizumab and were analyzed via RNA microarray.Results: Sixty-eight patients (139 metastases) were enrolled with a median follow-up of 10.4 months. One-year TMC was 895% with no difference between complete-Rx or partial-Rx. On multivariable analysis, TMC was independently associated with a reduced risk for death (HR, 0.36; 95% confidence interval, 0.17 0.75; P = 0.006). SBRT increased expression of innate and adaptive immune genes and concomitantly decreased expression of cell cycle and DNA repair genes in the irradiated tumors. Elevated post-SBRT expression of DNASE1 correlated with increased expression of cytolytic T-cell genes and irradiated tumor response.Conclusions: In the context of SBRT-FP, TMC independently correlates with OS. SBRT impacts intratumoral immune gene expression associated with TMC. Randomized trials are needed to validate these findings.

TI  - Herpes zoster in patients with lung cancer treated with PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies
T2  - IMMUNOTHERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: There are no available clinical data on immunotherapy and the risk of herpes zoster. Materials & methods: This retrospective study included patients with recurrent or advanced lung cancer who were inoperable and ineligible for radiotherapy and were treated with either a PD-1/PD-L1 antibody (136 patients) or an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (149 patients) at Jichi Medical University Hospital between January 2016 and December 2018. Results: Herpes zoster-free survival was significantly shorter in the PD-1/PD-L1 antibody-treated group compared with the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor-treated group (hazard ratio: 0.20; 95% CI: 0.048-0.84; p = 0.016). PD-1/PD-L1 antibody administration was independently and significantly associated with herpes zoster occurrence. Conclusion: Clinicians should anticipate herpes zoster in patients with lung cancer during treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies.Tweetable abstract Herpes zoster occurs more frequently in patients on immune checkpoint inhibitors for lung cancer than in those on EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Clinicians should be cautious of this during treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors.Plain language summary There are no available clinical data on immunotherapy and the risk of herpes zoster.

TI  - Radiotherapy prolongs the survival of advanced non-smallcell lung cancer patients undergone to an immune-modulating treatment with dose-fractioned cisplatin and metronomic etoposide and bevacizumab (mPEBev)
T2  - ONCOTARGET
M3  - Article
AB  - Radiotherapy (RT), together with a direct cytolytic effect on tumor tissue, also elicits systemic immunological events, which sometimes result in the regression of distant metastases (abscopal effect). We have shown the safety and anti-tumor activity of a novel metronomic chemotherapy (mCH) regimen with dose-fractioned cisplatin, oral etoposide and bevacizumab, a mAb against the vasculo-endothelial-growth-factor (mPEBev regimen), in metastatic non-small-cell-lung cancer (mNSCLC). This regimen, designed on the results of translational studies, showed immune-modulating effects that could trigger and empower the immunological effects associated with tumor irradiation. In order to assess this, we carried out a retrospective analysis in a subset of 69 consecutive patients who received the mPEBev regimen within the BEVA2007 trial. Forty-five of these patients, also received palliative RT of one or more metastatic sites. Statistical analysis (a Log-rank test) revealed a much longer median survival in the group of patients who received RT [mCH vs mCH + RT: 12.1+/-2.5 (95% CI 3.35-8.6) vs 22.12+/- 4.3 (95% CI 11.9-26.087) months; P=0.015] with no difference in progression-free survival. In particular, their survival correlated with the mPEBev regimen ability to induce the percentage of activated dendritic cells (DCs) (CD3-CD11b+CD15-CD83+CD80+) [Fold to baseline value (FBV) <= 1 vs > 1: 4+/-5.389 (95% CI, 0-14.56) vs 56+/-23.05 (95% CI, 10.8-101.2) months; P:0.049)] and central-memory-T-cells (CD3+CD8+CD45RA-CCR7+) [FBV <= 1 vs > 1: 8+/-5.96 (95% CI, 0-19.68) vs 31+/-12.3 (95% CI, 6.94-55.1) months; P: 0.045].These results suggest that tumor irradiation may prolong the survival of NSCLC patients undergone mPEBev regimen presumably by eliciting an immune-mediated effect and provide the rationale for further perspective clinical studies.

TI  - Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors: New Insights and Current Place in Cancer Therapy
T2  - PHARMACOTHERAPY
M3  - Review
AB  - The treatment of cancer has largely relied on killing tumor cells with nonspecific cytotoxic therapies and radiotherapy. This approach, however, has limitations including severe systemic toxicities, bystander effects on normal cells, recurrence of drug-resistant tumor cells, and the inability to target micrometastases or subclinical disease. An increased understanding of the critical role of the immune system in cancer development and progression has led to new treatment strategies using various immunotherapies. It is now recognized that established tumors have numerous mechanisms of suppressing the antitumor immune response including production of inhibitory cytokines, recruitment of immunosuppressive immune cells, and upregulation of coinhibitory receptors known as immune checkpoints. This review focuses on the immune checkpoint inhibitors, a novel class of immunotherapy first approved in 2011. Our objective is to highlight similarities and differences among the three immune checkpoint inhibitors approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration-ipilimumab, pembrolizumab, and nivolumab-to facilitate therapeutic decision making. We conducted a review of the published literature and conference proceedings and present a critical appraisal of the clinical evidence supporting their use in the treatment of metastatic melanoma and advanced squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We also compare and contrast their current place in cancer therapy and patterns of immune-related toxicities, and discuss the role of dual immune checkpoint inhibition and strategies for the management of immune-related adverse events. The immune checkpoint inhibitors have demonstrated a dramatic improvement in overall survival in patients with advanced melanoma and squamous NSCLC, along with acceptable toxicity profiles. These agents have a clear role in the first-line treatment of advanced melanoma and in the second-line treatment of advanced squamous NSCLC.

TI  - Treatment of small cell lung cancer: recent advances
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of review In this article, we aimed to summarize the recent progress being made in treatment of small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Recent findings SCLC is characterized by strong invasiveness, easy recurrence and early metastasis. In recent years, the emergence of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) therapy has broken the deadlock in the treatment field of SCLC. Combination strategies, such as the addition of ICIs to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, are actively underway. Some of these strategies have yielded significant survival benefits and tolerable adverse events, whereas several of them have failed with no significant improvement. In addition, the new classification of SCLC based on genomic analysis has deepened the understanding of SCLC and suggested new therapeutic directions. Similarly, the discovery of some new therapeutic targets, such as DDL3, CDK7 and PARP, also brings new hope for improving the survival of patients with SCLC. In this article, we will review the recent advances of therapeutic regimen for patients with SCLC. Following the revolutionary success of adding ICIs to chemotherapy, more varieties of combination strategies have been explored in recent trials. In addition, therapeutic drug research and efficacy evaluation against for new targets are under investigation. Altogether, progress on genomic analysis, investigation of biological pathways and treatment regimen combination are providing renewed hope for patients with SCLC.

TI  - Beta Blockers with Statins May Decrease All-Cause Mortality in Patients with Cardiovascular Diseases and Locally Advanced Unresectable Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer after Chemoradiotherapy
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Concurrent platinum-based chemoradiotherapy (CRT) followed by maintenance treatment with the PD-L1 inhibitor durvalumab is the most effective therapy in unresectable stage III non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, severe toxicity of this approach may lead to an unsatisfactory outcome. Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) may justify the use of sequential CRT to avoid severe adverse events and maintain satisfactory effectiveness. Ensuring that patients with CVD do not have a worse prognosis than patients without CVD is one of the goals of cardio-oncology. It is important that, after sequential CRT as personalized for patients with CVD, there is no increased mortality, and this is the first achievement of this study. Patients receiving beta-blockers and statins had lower all-cause mortality over 2, 3, and 4 years. The clear benefit of treatment with beta-blockers (in possible combination with statin) was confirmed in a subgroup of patients with CVD. The patients with CVD and indications for different cardiac therapy could live significantly longer if they received beta-blockers with or without statins during long-term follow-up. It may be a time to consider beta-blockers and statins as prevention strategy in patients undergoing CRT for NSCLC. The study was conducted in the era when maintenance immunotherapy with durvalumab was not available in clinical practice after chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in unresectable non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The main aim of the study was to check whether the presence of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and their pharmacotherapy affects the overall survival (OS) in such NSCLC patients undergoing sequential CRT. The group of 196 patients were analyzed: 101 patients with CVD (51.53%) and 95 patients with other reasons of qualification for sequential CRT (decreased performance status, older age, and other non-cardiovascular co-morbidities). Although patients with CVD were more often in older age, and they more often experienced cardiac and nephrological complications (p < 0.05 for all), there was a statistically nonsignificant trend for lower all-cause mortality in patients with CVD. The lowest all-cause mortality was observed in patients treated with beta-blockers and statins after two (HR = 0.31; 95%CI: 0.1-0.98; p = 0.047), three (HR = 0.33; 95%CI: 0.13-0.81; p = 0.015) and even four (HR = 0.45; 95%CI: 0.22-0.97; p = 0.027) years of follow-up. The benefit in OS remained significant in 101 patients with CVD treated with beta-blockers (HR = 0.65; 95%CI: 0.43-0.99; p = 0.045), and eventually statin, throughout the whole follow-up (log-rank p < 0.05). Further prospective studies are necessary to confirm the role of beta-blockers and statins in reduction of mortality in NSCLC patients undergoing radical CRT.

TI  - Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor-Targeted Neoantigen Peptide Vaccination for the Treatment of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer and Glioblastoma
T2  - VACCINES
M3  - Review
AB  - The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) plays crucial roles in several important biological functions such as embryogenesis, epithelial tissue development, and cellular regeneration. However, in multiple solid tumor types overexpression and/or activating mutations of the EGFR gene frequently occur, thus hijacking the EGFR signaling pathway to promote tumorigenesis. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumors in particular often contain prevalent and shared EGFR mutations that provide an ideal source for public neoantigens (NeoAg). Studies in both humans and animal models have confirmed the immunogenicity of some of these NeoAg peptides, suggesting that they may constitute viable targets for cancer immunotherapies. Peptide vaccines targeting mutated EGFR have been tested in multiple clinical trials, demonstrating an excellent safety profile and encouraging clinical efficacy. For example, the CDX-110 (rindopepimut) NeoAg peptide vaccine derived from the EGFRvIII deletion mutant in combination with temozolomide and radiotherapy has shown efficacy in treating EGFRvIII-harboring glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients undergone surgery in multiple Phase I and II clinical trials. Furthermore, pilot clinical trials that have administered personalized NeoAg peptides for treating advanced-stage NSCLC patients have shown this approach to be a feasible and safe method to increase antitumor immune responses. Amongst the vaccine peptides administered, EGFR mutation-targeting NeoAgs induced the strongest T cell-mediated immune responses in patients and were also associated with objective clinical responses, implying a promising future for NeoAg peptide vaccines for treating NSCLC patients with selected EGFR mutations. The efficacy of NeoAg-targeting peptide vaccines may be further improved by combining with other modalities such as tyrosine kinase or immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy, which are currently being tested in animal models and clinical trials. Herein, we review the most current basic and clinical research progress on EGFR-targeted peptide vaccination for the treatment of NSCLC and other solid tumor types.

TI  - A Single-Arm Multi-Center Phase II Clinical Trial of Cadonilimab (anti-PD-1/CTLA-4) in Combination with or without Conventional Second-Line Treatment for Patients with Extensive Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer
T2  - TECHNOLOGY IN CANCER RESEARCH & TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Cadonilimab (AK104) is a bispecific IgG-single-chain Fv fragment (ScFv) antibody that binds to PD-1 and CTLA-4. Cadonilimab has shown encouraging anti-tumour activity and a favourable safety profile in several tumour types. In second-line treatment, there is no defined standard of care for patients with extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). Cadonilimab is expected to show substantial clinical efficacy.Objective To assess the antitumor activity and safety of cadonilimab monotherapy or combination with conventional therapy in ES-SCLC patients who failed first-line treatment.Methods In this multicenter, open-label, phase II study, ES-SCLC patients who had failed first-line treatment, also aged 18 years to 70 years with histologically or cytologically confirmed ES-SCLC, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG-PS) of 0-2 were eligible. Patients will receive cadonilimab 10 mg/kg every three weeks (Q3 W) among 24 months until progressive disease (PD) or adverse events (AE) discovery. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS).Trial registration NCT05901584.

TI  - Relationship Between Radiation Pneumonitis Following Definitive Radiotherapy for Non-small Cell Lung Cancer and Isodose Line
T2  - IN VIVO
M3  - Article
AB  - Background/Aim: It is important to identify radiation pneumonitis above Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Grade 2 (G2) in order to safely continue durvalumab maintenance after chemoradiotherapy for advanced lung cancer. The aim of this study was to discover factors that predict pneumonitis above G2. Patients and Methods: A follow-up computed tomography (CT) image was superimposed on the planning CT image using deformable image registration (DIR). The pneumonitis area was contoured on follow-up CT after DIR and the dose-volume histogram parameters of the contoured pneumonitis area were calculated. Results: V5 (Percentage of total volume receiving >= 5 Gy) to V50 of pneumonitis were significantly lower in patients with G2 pneumonitis than in those with G1 pneumonitis. The pneumonitis V15 was the most significant. The group with pneumonitis V15 <87.10% had significantly more G2 pneumonitis than the group with pneumonitis V15 >= 87.10%. Conclusion: Pneumonitis V15 <87.10% was a risk factor for G2 pneumonitis.

TI  - Locally Advanced, Unresectable Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
T2  - CURRENT ONCOLOGY REPORTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of Review Treatment of locally advanced, unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has recently been revolutionized by the incorporation of immunotherapy to standard platinum-based concurrent chemoradiation. This review examines the current standard practices and ongoing studies on the management of locally advanced, unresectable NSCLC. Recent Findings Concurrent chemoradiation is the cornerstone of treatment of unresectable, locally advanced NSCLC. However, chemoradiation can be associated with high therapy-related toxicities, and risk of disease relapse remains significantly elevated despite treatment with curative intent. Durvalumab, a PD-L1 inhibitor, was recently approved as consolidation therapy following concurrent chemoradiation; this agent represents a major advancement in treatment of unresectable stage III NSCLC. Several clinical trials are currently underway to evaluate the benefit of different immunotherapy sequencing and other biomarker-driven strategies in this disease setting. Multiple trials are presently ongoing to assess novel immunotherapy and targeted therapy strategies to improve outcomes and decrease treatment-associated toxicities in patients with locally advanced NSCLC.

TI  - Management of patients with extensive small-cell lung cancer in the immunotherapy era: An Italian consensus through a Delphi approach
T2  - CRITICAL REVIEWS IN ONCOLOGY HEMATOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Immunotherapy represented a turning point for treating extensive small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). Although, many issues remain debated. Methods: A group of Italian medical and radiation oncologists with expertise in managing patients with ES-SCLC developed a list of statements divided in six areas of interest. The Delphi method was used to assess the consensus on the defined list of statements. Results: 32 statements were included in the final list to be voted by the Delphi panel, and 26 reached a consensus on the agreement. A prompt involvement of a multidisciplinary team is a priority to provide an integrated treatment strategy. First-line recommended treatment is immunotherapy in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy and etoposide for four cycles followed by maintenance immunotherapy. Conclusions: While awaiting new data from clinical trials and real-world studies, these recommendations can represent a useful tool to guide the management of ES-SCLC patients in daily practice.

TI  - Immune modulation in advanced radiotherapies: Targeting out-of-field effects
T2  - CANCER LETTERS
M3  - Review
AB  - By virtue of being a localized treatment modality, radiotherapy is unable to deliver a tumoricidal radiation dose to tissues outside of the irradiated field. Nevertheless, ionizing radiation may result in radiation damage mediated by a bystander like effect away from the irradiated field, but this response is likely to be modest when radiotherapy is the sole treatment modality. Over the last decade there has been a reemergence of immune modulating therapies as anti-cancer treatment modalities. Clinical trials on vaccines have on the whole been largely disappointing, but greater response rates have been observed from the immune checkpoint modulators. A clinical benefit of using such agents has been shown in disease sites such as melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer. There is growing pre-clinical data and a number of case reports which suggest the presence of abscopal effects when radiotherapy is co-administered with immune checkpoint inhibitors, suggesting that this combination may lead to an enhanced tumour response outside of the primary treatment field. In this review, the mechanisms of such an enhanced out-of-field tumour response, the potential clinical utilities, the optimal radiotherapy delivery and considerations for clinical follow-up following treatment are discussed.

M3  - Article
AB  - The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is overexpressed in the majority of non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs). This presents an opportune target for new treatment strategies designed to selectively interfere with the cancer cell growth cycle. Recent investigations into the biology of the EGFR and its downstream signaling pathways have reminded us of the complexity of cancer cell communications from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Multiple pathways are activated with stimulation of the autocrine and paracrine EGFR loop, from the ras-raf-MEK activation of ERK 1/2 to the PI3K-Akt pathway, each playing an important role in cancer cell survival, invasion, and angiogenesis. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that molecules targeting the EGFR, either through extracellular blockade or intracellular interference with the EGFR-associated tyrosine kinase, reversibly or irreversibly, inhibit cancer cell growth. Potent antitumor effects have been observed in human tumor xenograft models. Preclinical studies have also demonstrated cooperative effects when anti-EGFR agents are combined with radiation or chemotherapy. Many of these agents have now entered into advanced human clinical trials with modest dose-related toxicity despite chronic administration. Encouraging response rates with single-agent targeted therapy have been reported in heavily pretreated patients with advanced NSCLC. In addition, agents targeting the angiogenic pathway, which plays a key role in the regulation of angiogenesis, may play an important role in enhancing the efficacy of anti-EGFR agents. This article will focus on the biology, rationale, and preclinical studies with targeted anti-EGFR and antiangiogenic therapies for the management of NSCLC. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Recent Advances and Future Strategies for Immune-Checkpoint Inhibition in Small-Cell Lung Cancer
T2  - CLINICAL LUNG CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is distinguished from nonesmall-cell lung cancer by its rapid growth and more frequent metastases. Although patients with SCLC are highly responsive to chemotherapy and radiation therapy, long-term prognosis remains poor, with relapse and disease recurrence occurring in almost all cases. Whereas combination chemotherapies continue to be the standard of care in extensive-stage SCLC, there is value in exploring whether immune-checkpoint inhibition is an effective treatment strategy, given the durable responses in nonesmall-cell lung cancer. Data from SCLC trials have shown clinical activity and response to cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 protein and programmed cell death-1 blockade, suggesting that antibodies targeting these pathways may be effective in improving survival outcome. However, data on clinical activity by programmed cell death-1 ligand expression in SCLC are not widely available. Limited data indicate that programmed cell death-1 ligand expression may not be an ideal biomarker for patient selection. Continued research is necessary to better optimize patient selection and response to therapy.

TI  - Durvalumab in non-small-cell lung cancer patients: current developments
T2  - FUTURE ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are a key component of treating advanced cancer patients, principally antibodies against CTLA-4 and PD-1 or PD-L1. Durvalumab (MEDI4736) is a selective, high-affinity, human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that blocks PD-L1, which binds to PD-1 and CD80, but not to PD-L2. Single-agent durvalumab showed clinical efficacy and a manageable safety profile in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer, particularly the >= 25% PD-L1+ population. Durvalumab is under evaluation in early, locally advanced and advanced disease as monotherapy and combined with ICIs, targeted therapies, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Impressive activity has been recently reported after chemoradiation in locally advanced patients; promising activity was observed with other ICI combinations, and potentially with other drugs including platinum-based chemotherapy. In contrast, early data reveal lower response rates in EGFR and ALK-positive patients.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of concurrent immune checkpoint inhibitors combined with radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer: A systematic review and single-arm meta-analysis
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The recent usage of immunotherapy combined with chemoradiotherapy has improved survival in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. However, determining the most effective therapy combination remains a topic of debate. Research suggests immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) post-chemoradiotherapy enhance survival, but the impact of concurrent ICIs during chemoradiotherapy on rapid disease progression is unclear. This meta-analysis aims to assess the effectiveness and safety of concurrent ICIs with radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy in advanced non-small cell lung cancer.Methods We searched PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science for relevant studies, extracting data on overall response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and adverse events (AEs).Results The analysis included ten studies with 490 participants. Stage III NSCLC ORR was 81.8%, while Stage IV ORR was 39.9%. One-year PFS and OS for Stage III were 68.2% and 82.6%, compared to 27.9% and 72.2% for Stage IV. Common adverse events included anemia (46.6%), nausea (47.6%), rash (36.4%), and radiation pneumonitis (36.3%).Conclusions Our meta-analysis shows concurrent ICIs with chemoradiotherapy are effective and safe in advanced NSCLC, particularly in stage III patients at risk of progression before starting ICIs after chemoradiotherapy. The findings support further phase III trials. The review protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42023493685) and is detailed on the NIHR HTA programme website.

M3  - Article
AB  - On March 4th 2022, nivolumab received regular US Food and Drug Administration approval, based on the CheckMate 816 trial results, for use "with platinum -doublet chemotherapy for adult patients with resectable NSCLC in the neoadjuvant setting ". This is the first neoadjuvant approval of a checkpoint inhibitor, a unique event in the history of lung cancer treatment. However, open questions remains. First, the co-primary endpoints of the CheckMate 816 trial (event-free survival and pathological complete response) are not yet validated surrogate endpoints in this setting. Second, the control arm was not reflecting the most common approach, being upfront surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. Third, protocol changes were not plainly justified, questioning the analytic plan of the trial. Fourth and last, a subpar access to checkpoint inhibitor for patients upon progression may weaken overall survival results. Neoadjuvant strategies allow to study initial response under treatment, and constitute an encouraging therapeutic avenue. However, the best sequence of treatment is the key question in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant settings: is treating everyone upfront better than treating only patients that will eventually recur?Investigating optimal sequence strategy is even more critical within the checkpoint-inhibitor era, where patients with advanced or metastatic disease may present long-term advantage. Trials with optimal post -progression treatment are needed to help optimize our treatment algorithm, and spare toxicity for patients who don't derive benefit.

TI  - High bone tumor burden to identify advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients with survival benefit upon bone targeted agents and immune checkpoint inhibitors
T2  - LUNG CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Bone-targeted agents (BTA), such as denosumab (DN) and zoledronic acid (ZA), have historically reduced the risk of skeletal related events in cancer patients with bone metastases (BM), with no improvement in survival outcomes. In the immunotherapy era, BM have been associated with poor prognosis upon immune -checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). Currently, the impact of bone tumor burden on survival upon BTAs in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (aNSCLC) patients treated with ICI remains unknown. Methods: Data from ICI-treated aNSCLC patients with BM (4/2013-5/2022) in one institution were retrospec-tively collected. BTA-ICI concurrent treatment was defined as BTA administration at any time before or within 90 days from ICI start. High bone tumor burden (HBTB) was defined as >= 3 sites of BM. Median OS (mOS) was estimated with Kaplan-Meier. Aikaike's information criterion (AIC) was used to select the best model for data analysis adjusted for clinical variables. Results: Of 134 patients included, 51 (38 %) received BTA. At a mFU of 39.6 months (m), BTA-ICIs concurrent treatment did not significantly impact on mOS [8.3 m (95% CI 3.9-12.8) versus (vs) 6.8 m (95% CI 4.0-9.6) p = 0.36]; these results were confirmed after adjustment for clinical variables selected by AIC. A multivariate model showed a significant interaction between BTA use and HBTB or radiation therapy to BM. In subgroup analyses, only HBTB confirmed to be associated with significantly longer mOS [8.3 m (95% CI 2.4-14.2) vs 3.5 m (95% CI 2.9-4.1), p = 0.003] and mPFS [3.0 m (95% CI 1.6-4.4) vs 1.8 m (95% CI 1.6-2.0) p = 0.001] upon BTA-ICI concurrent treatment, with the most pronounced OS benefit observed for DN-ICI concurrent regimen [15.2 m (95% CI 0.1-30.7) vs 3.5 m (95% CI 2.9-4.1) p = 0.002]. Conclusions: In the immunotherapy era, HBTB can identify patients experiencing survival benefit with BTA, especially with DN-ICI combination. HBTB should be included as a stratification factor in the upcoming trials assessing BTA and ICI combinations in patients with aNSCLC and BM.

TI  - Durvalumab plus platinum-etoposide versus platinum-etoposide in first-line treatment of extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (CASPIAN): a randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 3 trial
T2  - LANCET
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Most patients with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) have extensive-stage disease at presentation, and prognosis remains poor. Recently, immunotherapy has demonstrated clinical activity in extensive-stage SCLC (ES-SCLC). The CASPIAN trial assessed durvalumab, with or without tremelimumab, in combination with etoposide plus either cisplatin or carboplatin (platinum-etoposide) in treatment-naive patients with ES-SCLC.Methods This randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial was done at 209 sites across 23 countries. Eligible patients were adults with untreated ES-SCLC, with WHO performance status 0 or 1 and measurable disease as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1. Patients were randomly assigned (in a 1:1:1 ratio) to durvalumab plus platinum-etoposide; durvalumab plus tremelimumab plus platinum-etoposide; or platinum-etoposide alone. All drugs were administered intravenously. Platinum-etoposide consisted of etoposide 80-100 mg/m(2) on days 1-3 of each cycle with investigator's choice of either carboplatin area under the curve 5-6 mg/mL per min or cisplatin 75-80 mg/m(2) (administered on day 1 of each cycle). Patients received up to four cycles of platinum-etoposide plus durvalumab 1500 mg with or without tremelimumab 75 mg every 3 weeks followed by maintenance durvalumab 1500 mg every 4 weeks in the immunotherapy groups and up to six cycles of platinum-etoposide every 3 weeks plus prophylactic cranial irradiation (investigator's discretion) in the platinum-etoposide group. The primary endpoint was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. We report results for the durvalumab plus platinumetoposide group versus the platinum-etoposide group from a planned interim analysis. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of their assigned study treatment. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03043872, and is ongoing.Findings Patients were enrolled between March 27, 2017, and May 29, 2018. 268 patients were allocated to the durvalumab plus platinum-etoposide group and 269 to the platinum-etoposide group. Durvalumab plus platinumetoposide was associated with a significant improvement in overall survival, with a hazard ratio of 0.73 (95% CI 0.59-0.91; p=0.0047]); median overall survival was 13.0 months (95% CI 11.5-14.8) in the durvalumab plus platinum-etoposide group versus 10.3 months (9.3-11.2) in the platinum-etoposide group, with 34% (26.9-41.0) versus 25% (18.4-31.6) of patients alive at 18 months. Any-cause adverse events of grade 3 or 4 occurred in 163 (62%) of 265 treated patients in the durvalumab plus platinum-etoposide group and 166 (62%) of 266 in the platinumetoposide group; adverse events leading to death occurred in 13 (5%) and 15 (6%) patients.Interpretation First-line durvalumab plus platinum-etoposide significantly improved overall survival in patients with ES-SCLC versus a clinically relevant control group. Safety findings were consistent with the known safety profiles of all drugs received. Copyright (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - MET Oncogene in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: Mechanism of MET Dysregulation and Agents Targeting the HGF/c-Met Axis
T2  - ONCOTARGETS AND THERAPY
M3  - Review
AB  - Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide and has a poor prognosis. Current treatments for advanced NSCLC included traditional chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy. The efficacy of targeted therapy relies on oncogene addiction. Mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (MET) gene can encode unconventional receptor tyrosine kinases with pleiotropic functions, when signals are abnormally activated, it can initiate and maintain tumor transformation, promote cell proliferation, survival, tumor invasion and angiogenesis. Thus, it is a promising therapeutic target. Previous studies have shown that elevated levels of HGF and/or overexpression of c-Met are associated with poor prognosis in lung cancer. In preclinical and clinical trials, c-MET inhibitors have shown some antitumor activity in NSCLC. Although the efficacy results of MET inhibitors in Phase III clinical trials are disappointing, given the molecular heterogeneity of NSCLC, only subgroups of patients with MET gene alterations may benefit from c-MET inhibitors. The challenge for the future is to screen out the potential beneficiaries. To solve this problem, there is need for large data analysis for the detection methods and treatment effects, to establish standards that meet the MET activation status, and determine reliable thresholds to achieve effective patient stratification and clinical decision making. This article summarized the structure of the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/c-Met axis, the different mechanisms of MET addiction, as well as MET amplification as acquired resistance mechanism to epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors, the latest advances of MET inhibitors, and immuotherapy in the treatment of NSCLC with MET alterations.

TI  - Toxicity of definitive and post-operative radiation following ipilimumab in non-small cell lung cancer
T2  - LUNG CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - To determine the feasibility and toxicity of radiation therapy, delivered either as definitive treatment or following surgery, following neo-adjuvant immune checkpoint inhibition for locally advanced NSCLC sixteen patients who received neo-adjuvant chemotherapy including ipilimumab as part of a phase II study were identified. Patients were analyzed by intent of radiation and toxicity graded based on CTCAE 4.0. There were seven patients identified who received definitive radiation and nine who received postoperative radiation. There was no grade 3 or greater toxicity in the definitive treatment group although one patient stopped treatment early due to back pain secondary to progression outside of the treatment field. In the post-operative treatment group, one patient required a one week break due to grade 2 odynophagia and no grade 3 or greater toxicity was observed. In this study of radiation as definitive or post-operative treatment following neo-adjuvant chemotherapy including ipilimumab for locally advanced NSCLC was feasible and well tolerated with limited toxicity.

TI  - Targeting DNA repair in cancer: current state and novel approaches
T2  - CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR LIFE SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - DNA damage response, DNA repair and genomic instability have been under study for their role in tumor initiation and progression for many years now. More recently, next-generation sequencing on cancer tissue from various patient cohorts have revealed mutations and epigenetic silencing of various genes encoding proteins with roles in these processes. These findings, together with the unequivocal role of DNA repair in therapeutic response, have fueled efforts toward the clinical exploitation of research findings. The successful example of PARP1/2 inhibitors has also supported these efforts and led to numerous preclinical and clinical trials with a large number of small molecules targeting various components involved in DNA repair singularly or in combination with other therapies. In this review, we focus on recent considerations related to DNA damage response and new DNA repair inhibition agents. We then discuss how immunotherapy can collaborate with these new drugs and how epigenetic drugs can rewire the activity of repair pathways and sensitize cancer cells to DNA repair inhibition therapies.

TI  - PD-1/PD-L1 Blockers in NSCLC Brain Metastases: Challenging Paradigms and Clinical Practice
T2  - CLINICAL CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have revolutionized the management of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, most pivotal phase III trials systematically excluded patients with active brain metastases, precluding the generalization of the results. Although theoretically restricted from crossing the blood-brain barrier, the novel pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profiles of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 drugs have prompted studies to evaluate their activity in patients with NSCLC with active central nervous system (CNS) involvement. Encouraging results have suggested that ICI could be active in the CNS in selected patients with driver-negative advanced NSCLC with high PD-L1 expression and low CNS disease burden. Single-agent CNS response rates around 30% have been reported. Beyond this particular setting, anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies have been evaluated in patients receiving local therapy for brain metastases (BM), addressing concerns about potential neurologic toxicity risks associated with radiotherapy, more specifically, radionecrosis (RN). Accordingly, a variety of clinical and imaging strategies are being appropriately developed to evaluate tumor response and to rule out pseudoprogression or radionecrosis. Our purpose is to critically summarize the advances regarding the role of systemic anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies for the treatment of NSCLC BM. Data were collected from the PubMed database, reference lists, and abstracts from the latest scientific meetings. Recent reports suggest anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agents are active in a subset of patients with NSCLC with BM showing acceptable toxicity. These advances are expected to change soon the management of these patients but additional research is required to address concerns regarding radionecrosis and the appropriate sequencing of local and systemic therapy combinations.

TI  - Postoperative radiotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer stage IIIA-N2: Focus and perspectives
T2  - BULLETIN DU CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Patients with resectable stage IIIA - N2 lung cancer represent a very heterogeneous population with variable risks of postoperative recurrence depending on the type of N2 involvement (unisite N2, multisite N2, bulky N2, extra-capsular rupture, incomplete resection. . .). This heterogeneity associated with the difficulty of carrying out prospective randomized studies with sufficient power in stages IIIA - 2, results in the absence of clear and consensual recommendations (except for stages IIIA- N2 resectable R0, since LungART and PORT-C studies). The objective of this article is to make an update on the place of postoperative radiotherapy in the management of stages IIIA - N2 following the publication of two recent randomized trials (PORT-C and LungART) but also compare them fort a better understanding of the current issues raised by these first published results. Indeed, these two trials do not find any benefit in terms of progression free survival and overall survival of postoperative radiotherapy but exploratory analyzes from these two studies seem to show a potential benefit of postoperative in some pN2 populations at high risk of locoregional recurrence (N2 multisite, N2 bulky. . .). In addition, the advent of immunotherapy (atezolizumab or pembrolizumab) and targeted therapies (osimertinib) in the adjuvant situation are redebating the place of a possible indication for postoperative radiotherapy in stage IIIA - 2.

T2  - EXPERT REVIEW OF ANTICANCER THERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The prognosis of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains poor, with a 5-year overall survival rate of around 15%. Immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as programmed cell death protein 1 and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors, have opened a new era in the management of NSCLC. Three checkpoint inhibitors (nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and atezolizumab) are currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for advanced NSCLC. Durvalumab, an anti-PD-L1 antibody, is under investigation in several trials. Areas covered: This article reviews the pharmacological properties, clinical efficacy, and safety of durvalumab as monotherapy and in combination with other drugs for the treatment of locally advanced and advanced NSCLC. Expert opinion: Durvalumab as monotherapy or in combination with tremelimumab was effective with well-tolerated safety profiles for advanced NSCLC in several phase I or II studies. The PACIFIC study assessed the effectiveness of durvalumab as maintenance therapy following definitive chemoradiotherapy for unresectable stage III NSCLC, and met its primary endpoints of progression-free survival and overall survival. These results led to FDA approval for this NSCLC population. It will be exciting to follow ongoing phase III studies assessing how durvalumab fits into the rapidly evolving therapeutic landscape for advanced NSCLC.

TI  - Early-Stage Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: New Challenges with Immune Checkpoint Blockers and Targeted Therapies
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Simple Summary The current review summarizes the new potential treatment strategies for patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer with immunotherapy and targeted therapies and defines the current challenges for making treatment decisions with these approaches in daily practice.Abstract The recent advent of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and immune checkpoint blockers (ICBs) in early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has dramatically modified treatment strategies by improving the prognosis in this setting. Osimertinib and alectinib, both TKIs, have shown significant improvements in outcomes for patients with resected EGFR- and ALK-positive NSCLC, respectively, changing the standard of care in these subgroups. More recently, the LAURA trial showed the efficacy of osimertinib after chemoradiotherapy in patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC harboring EGFR mutations. Numerous trials are still ongoing to investigate neoadjuvant/perioperative TKIs in several oncogene-driven NSCLC. In addition, several ICBs have been tested and approved as adjuvant (atezolizumab and pembrolizumab), neoadjuvant (nivolumab), and perioperative treatments (pembrolizumab) for patients with resectable early-stage NSCLC. Despite these advances, many challenges remain regarding the use of TKIs and ICBs in this setting, including the optimal duration of adjuvant TKI or induction ICB therapy, the role of minimal residual disease to identify patients at high-risk of disease relapse and to guide adjuvant treatment decisions, and the role of adjuvant chemotherapy in resected oncogene-driven NSCLC. Furthermore, potential predictive biomarkers for efficacy are needed to eventually intensify the entire perioperative strategies. This review aims to summarize and discuss the available evidence, the ongoing trials, and the challenges associated with TKI- and ICB-based approaches in early-stage NSCLC.

T2  - RADIATION RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - The last decade has witnessed a revolution in the clinical application of high-dose "ablative" radiation therapy. Initially this approach was limited to the treatment of brain tumors, but more recently we have seen its successful extension to tumors outside the brain, e.g., for small lung nodules. These advances have been driven largely by improvements in image-guided inverse treatment planning that allow the dose per fraction to the tumor to be increased over the conventional 2 Gy dose while keeping the late normal tissue complications at an acceptable level by dose limitation. Despite initial concerns about excessive late complications, as might be expected based on dose extrapolations using the linear-quadratic equation, these approaches have shown considerable clinical promise. Our knowledge of the biological consequences of high-doses of ionizing radiation in normal and cancerous tissues has lagged behind these clinical advances. Our intent here is to survey recent experimental findings from the perspective of better understanding the biological effects of high-dose therapy and whether they are truly different from conventional doses. We will also consider the implications of this knowledge for further refining and improving these approaches on the basis of underlying mechanisms. (C) 2014 by Radiation Research Society

TI  - Response to the treatment immediately before nivolumab monotherapy may predict clinical response to nivolumab in patients with non-small cell lung cancer
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Currently, no markers predictive of response to nivolumab monotherapy in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are currently recognized in Japan. The present study was undertaken to identify such markers.Materials and methods Medical records of 50 patients with advanced NSCLC and treated with nivolumab monotherapy at Shizuoka Cancer Center between December 2015 and April 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. The parameters studied were age, sex, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, smoking history, histological diagnosis, epidermal growth factor receptor or anaplastic lymphoma kinase status, therapeutic line of nivolumab, efficacy of treatment immediately before nivolumab monotherapy, and time since previous therapy.Results The objective response rate to nivolumab monotherapy was 18% [95% confidence interval (CI) 10-31]. Multivariate logistic regression identified "squamous histology" [odds ratio (OR) 0.00054; 95% CI 0-0.27] and "response to the treatment immediately before nivolumab monotherapy" (OR 0.0011; 95% CI 0-0.092) as independently associated with response to nivolumab monotherapy.Conclusion "Response to the treatment immediately before nivolumab monotherapy" might be a predictive marker of response to nivolumab in patients with advanced NSCLC.

TI  - First-Line Immune Checkpoint Inhibition for Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer: State of the Art and Future Directions
T2  - DRUGS
M3  - Review
AB  - The advent of PD-(L)1 and CTLA-4 immune check point inhibitors (CPIs) has dramatically changed the treatment landscape of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). For up to a quarter of patients with advanced NSCLC, CPIs have the potential to induce durable responses with long-term survival outcomes. Since the approval of first-line pembrolizumab for patients whose tumors express a PD-L1 >= 50%, several pivotal first-line CPI-based phase 3 studies have been conducted investigating combination treatments combining CPIs with chemotherapy (ChT) or combining different CPIs with or without ChT. As a result, there has been an increase in front-line treatment options for advanced NSCLC, and treatment algorithms are changing very quickly. In fit patients with advanced NSCLC, combination treatments including CPI and ChT are considered the new standard of care with improved clinical outcomes. CPI combination treatments are well tolerated and quality of life also seems to be better when CPIs are implemented in the first-line setting. The aim of this review is to provide a summary of the recently published first-line phase 3 studies investigating CPIs as monotherapy or in combination with other CPIs or ChT in advanced NSCLC, and to suggest possible treatment algorithms.

TI  - Resampling and harmonization for mitigation of heterogeneity in image parameters of baseline scans
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Our study investigates the effects of heterogeneity in image parameters on the reproducibility of prognostic performance of models built using radiomic biomarkers. We compare the prognostic performance of models derived from the heterogeneity-mitigated features with that of models obtained from raw features, to assess whether reproducibility of prognostic scores improves upon application of our methods. We used two datasets: The Breast I-SPY1 dataset-Baseline DCE-MRI scans of 156 women with locally advanced breast cancer, treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, publicly available via The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA); The NSCLC IO dataset-Baseline CT scans of 107 patients with stage 4 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), treated with pembrolizumab immunotherapy at our institution. Radiomic features (n=102) are extracted from the tumor ROIs. We use a variety of resampling and harmonization scenarios to mitigate the heterogeneity in image parameters. The patients were divided into groups based on batch variables. For each group, the radiomic phenotypes are combined with the clinical covariates into a prognostic model. The performance of the groups is assessed using the c-statistic, derived from a Cox proportional hazards model fitted on all patients within a group. The heterogeneity-mitigation scenario (radiomic features, derived from images that have been resampled to minimum voxel spacing, are harmonized using the image acquisition parameters as batch variables) gave models with highest prognostic scores (for e.g., IO dataset; batch variable: high kernel resolution-c-score: 0.66). The prognostic performance of patient groups is not comparable in case of models built using non-heterogeneity mitigated features (for e.g., I-SPY1 dataset; batch variable: small pixel spacing-c-score: 0.54, large pixel spacing-c-score: 0.65). The prognostic performance of patient groups is closer in case of heterogeneity-mitigated scenarios (for e.g., scenario-harmonize by voxel spacing parameters: IO dataset; thin slice-c-score: 0.62, thick slice-c-score: 0.60). Our results indicate that accounting for heterogeneity in image parameters is important to obtain more reproducible prognostic scores, irrespective of image site or modality. For non-heterogeneity mitigated models, the prognostic scores are not comparable across patient groups divided based on batch variables. This study can be a step in the direction of constructing reproducible radiomic biomarkers, thus increasing their application in clinical decision making.

TI  - Checkpoint Inhibitors in Head and Neck Cancer: Rationale, Clinical Activity, and Potential Biomarkers
T2  - CURRENT TREATMENT OPTIONS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The discovery and antibody targeting of immune regulatory molecules such as programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) pathways have led to clinically meaningful anti-cancer results. Rapid advances are being made in a variety of tumor types resulting in regulatory approvals in melanoma, non small cell lung cancer, and renal cell cancer. Numerous ongoing studies are expected to establish the worth of PD-1 pathway inhibitors in other tumor types as well as in combinations with approved agents. Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) represents a complex group of malignancies characterized by profound immunosuppression and is an excellent candidate for investigation in this exciting field. However, given the fact that a subset of patients will likely benefit, it is critical to focus on biomarker development for appropriate patient selection and facilitation of trial design. As immunotherapy is settling in cancer treatment, immune checkpoint inhibitors are emerging as one of the most promising agents.

TI  - RET aberrant cancers and RET inhibitor therapies: Current state-of-the-art and future perspectives
T2  - PHARMACOLOGY & THERAPEUTICS
M3  - Review
AB  - Precision oncology informed by genomic information has evolved in leaps and bounds over the last decade. Al-though non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has moved to center-stage as the poster child of precision oncology, multiple targetable genomic alterations have been identified in various cancer types. RET alterations occur in roughly 2% of all human cancers. The role of RET as oncogenic driver was initially identified in 1985 after the dis-covery that transfection with human lymphoma DNA transforms NIH-3T3 fibroblasts. Germline RET mutations are causative of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 syndrome, and RET fusions are found in 10-20% of papillary thyroid cases and are detected in most patients with advanced sporadic medullary thyroid cancer. RET fusions are oncogenic drivers in 2% of Non-small cell lung cancer. Rapid translation and regulatory approval of selective RET inhibitors, selpercatinib and pralsetinib, have opened up the field of RET precision oncology. This review provides an update on RET precision oncology from bench to bedside and back. We explore the impact of selective RET in-hibitor in patients with advanced NSCLC, thyroid cancer, and other cancers in a tissue-agnostic fashion, resistance mechanisms, and future directions.(c) 2023 Published by Elsevier Inc.

T2  - BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-REVIEWS ON CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer mortality in men and women in the U.S. and worldwide. About 90% of lung cancer cases are caused by smoking and the use of tobacco products. However, other factors such as radon gas, asbestos, air pollution exposures, and chronic infections can contribute to lung carcinogenesis. In addition, multiple inherited and acquired mechanisms of susceptibility to lung cancer have been proposed. Lung cancer is divided into two broad histologic classes, which grow and spread differently: small-cell lung carcinomas (SCLCs) and non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs). Treatment options for lung cancer include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy. Therapeutic-modalities recommendations depend on several factors, including the type and stage of cancer. Despite the improvements in diagnosis and therapy made during the past 25 years, the prognosis for patients with lung cancer is still unsatisfactory. The responses to current standard therapies are poor except for the most localized cancers. However, a better understanding of the biology pertinent to these challenging malignancies, might lead to the development of more efficacious and perhaps more specific drugs. The purpose of this review is to summarize the recent developments in lung cancer biology and its therapeutic strategies, and discuss the latest treatment advances including therapies currently under clinical investigation.

TI  - Locally Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: Optimal Chemotherapeutic Agents and Duration
T2  - CURRENT TREATMENT OPTIONS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the USA. The treatment of locally advanced NSCLC (LA-NSCLC) is challenging and must be individualized. For patients with completely resected stage III NSCLC, adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy for 4 cycles is recommended. For patients with inoperable or unresectable stage III NSCLC, chemoradiation is the preferred treatment. Patients with a good performance status, minimal or no weight loss, and adequate pulmonary function should be offered concurrent chemoradiation. The optimal chemotherapeutic agents to be used concurrently with radiation remain undefined. In the USA, cisplatin plus etoposide or carboplatin plus paclitaxel are the most commonly used regimens. In addition, the optimal duration of therapy remains undefined, including the role of consolidation chemotherapy. Thus far, randomized phase III trials have failed to identify a survival advantage for administering chemotherapy beyond that delivered during radiation therapy. Molecularly targeted agents, angiogenesis inhibitors, and immunotherapy have a defined role for patients with metastatic disease. The role, if any, of these new classes of agents is undergoing investigation for patients with earlier stage disease, including stage III disease.

T2  - CANCER RADIOTHERAPIE
M3  - Article
AB  - Concomitant radiochemotherapy has been the standard of care for unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), irrespective of histological sub-type or molecular characteristics. Currently, only 15-30 % of patients are alive five years after radiochemotherapy, and this figure remains largely unchanged despite multiple phase III randomised trials. In recent years, immune-checkpoint blockades with anti-PD-(L)1 have revolutionised the care of metastatic NSCLC, becoming the standard front- and second-line strategy. Several preclinical studies reported an increased tumour antigen release, improved antigen presentation, and T-cell infiltration in irradiated tumours. Immunotherapy has therefore recently been evaluated for patients with locally advanced stage III NSCLC. Following the PACIFIC trial, the anti-PD-L1 durvalumab antibody has emerged as a new standard consolidative treatment for patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC whose disease has not progressed following concomitant platinum-based chemoradiotherapy. Immunoradiotherapy therefore appears to be a promising association in patients with localised NSCLC. Many trials are currently evaluating the value of concomitant immunotherapy and chemoradiotherapy and/or consolidative chemotherapy with immunotherapy in patients with locally advanced unresectable NSCLC.

TI  - Targeting programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) for treatment of non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC); the recent advances
T2  - PATHOLOGY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - The immune system uses various immune checkpoint axes to adjust responses, support homeostasis, and deter self-reactivity and autoimmunity. Nevertheless, non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) can use protective mechanisms to facilitate immune evasion, which leads to potentiated cancer survival and proliferation. In this light, many blocking anti-bodies have been developed to negatively regulate checkpoint molecules, in particular, programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) / PD-ligand 1 (L1), and bypass these immune suppressive mechanisms. Meanwhile, anti-PD-1 anti-bodies such as nivolumab, pembrolizumab, cemiplimab, and sintilimab have shown excellent competence in successfully inspiring immune responses versus NSCLC. Accordingly, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recently approved nivolumab (alone or in combination with ipilimumab) and pembrolizumab (alone or in combination with chemotherapy) as first-line treatment for advanced NSCLC patients. However, PD-1 blockade monotherapy remains inefficient in more than 60% of NSCLC patients, and many patients don't respond or acquire resistance to this modality. Also, toxicities related to anti-PD-1 antibody have been progressively identified in clinical trials and oncology practice. Herein, we will outline the clinical benefits of PD-1 blockade therapy alone or in combination with other treatments (e.g., chemotherapy, radiotherapy, anti-angiogenic therapy) in NSCLC patients. Moreover, we will take a glimpse into the recently identified predictive biomarkers to determine patients most likely to suffer serious adverse events to decrease untoward toxicity risk and diminish treatment costs.

T2  - Zhongguo fei ai za zhi = Chinese journal of lung cancer
M3  - Consensus Development Conference
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common pathological type of lung cancer. The systemic antitumor therapy of advanced NSCLC has undergone renovations of chemotherapy, targeted therapy and immunotherapy, which results in greatly improved survival for patients with advanced NSCLC. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), especially targeting programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), has changed the treatment paradigm of NSCLC. ICIs have become the standard treatment for advanced NSCLC without epidermal growth factor receptor(EGFR) mutation or anaplastic lymphomakinase(ALK) translocation in the first- or second-line setting, and for locally advanced NSCLC following concurrent radiotherapy and chemotherapy. ICIs are also promising in adjuvant/neoadjuvant therapy. More and more ICIs have been approved domestically for the treatment of NSCLC. Led by the NSCLC expert committee of Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology (CSCO), this consensus was developed and updated based on thoroughly reviewing domestic and foreign literatures, clinical trial data, systematic reviews, experts' discussion and the consensus(2019 version). This consensus will aid domestic clinicians in the treatment of NSCLC with ICIs. .

T2  - CURRENT TREATMENT OPTIONS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Brain metastases are common in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and due to associated poor prognosis, this field is an important area of need for the development of innovative medical therapies. Therapies including local approaches through surgical intervention and/or radiation and evolving systemic therapies have led to improvements in the treatment of brain metastases in patients with lung cancer. Strategies that consider applying advanced radiation techniques to minimize toxicity, intervening early with effective systemic therapies to spare radiation/surgery, testing radiosensitization combinations, and developing drug penetrant molecules have and will continue to define new practice patterns. We believe that in carefully considered asymptomatic patients, first-line systemic therapy may be considered before radiation therapy and small-molecule targeted therapy may provide an opportunity to defer radiation therapy for recurrence or progression of disease. The next several years in oncology drug development will see the reporting on of brain penetrant molecules in oncogene-defined non-small cell lung cancer. Ongoing studies will evaluate immunotherapies in patients with brain metastases with associated endpoints. We hope that continued drug development and carefully designed clinical trials may afford an opportunity to improve the lives of patients with brain metastases.

TI  - The Landscape of Immunotherapy in Advanced NSCLC: Driving Beyond PD-1/PD-L1 Inhibitors (CTLA-4, LAG3, IDO, OX40, TIGIT, Vaccines)
T2  - CURRENT ONCOLOGY REPORTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of Review In this review, we analyzed the current landscape of non-PD-(L)1 targeting immunotherapy. Recent Findings The advent of immunotherapy has completely changed the standard approach toward advanced NSCLC. Inhibitors of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis have quickly taken place as first-line treatment for NSCLC patients without targetable "driver" mutations. However, a non-negligible portion of patients derive modest benefit from immune-checkpoint inhibitors, and valid second-line alternatives are lacking, pushing researchers to analyze other molecules and pathways as potentially viable targets in the struggle against NSCLC. Starting from the better characterized CTLA-4 inhibitors, we then critically collected the actual knowledge on NSCLC vaccines as well as on other emerging molecules, many of them in their early phase of testing, to provide to the reader a comprehensive overview of the state of the art of immunotherapy in NSCLC beyond PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors.

M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: The addition of adjuvant durvalumab improves overall survival in locally advanced nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with definitive chemoradiation, but the real-world uptake of adjuvant durvalumab is unknown. Materials and Methods: We identified patients with stage III NSCLC treated with definitive concurrent chemoradiation from January 2018 to October 2020 from a statewide radiation oncology quality consortium, representing a mix of community (n=22 centers) and academic (n=5) across the state of Michigan. Use of adjuvant durvalumab was ascertained at the time of routine 3-month or 6-month follow-up after completion of chemoradiation. Results: Of 421 patients with stage III NSCLC who completed chemoradiation, 322 (76.5%) initiated adjuvant durvalumab. The percentage of patients initiating adjuvant durvalumab increased over time from 66% early in the study period to 92% at the end of the study period. There was substantial heterogeneity by treatment center, ranging from 53% to 90%. In multivariable logistic regression, independent predictors of durvalumab initiation included more recent month (odds ratio [OR]: 1.05 per month, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02-1.08, P=0.003), lower Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score (OR: 4.02 for ECOG 0 vs. 2+, 95% CI: 1.67-9.64, P=0.002), and a trend toward significance for female sex (OR: 1.66, 95% CI: 0.98-2.82, P=0.06). Conclusion: Adjuvant durvalumab for stage III NSCLC treated with definitive chemoradiation was rapidly and successfully incorporated into clinical care across a range of community and academic settings in the state of Michigan, with over 90% of potentially eligible patients starting durvalumab in more recent months.

TI  - Immunotherapy for lung cancer: ongoing clinical trials
T2  - FUTURE ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Modulation of a patient's immune system so that it acts against lung cancer cells has not been successful in the past decades. Advances in our understanding of the immune response to tumors resulted in the development of different kinds of novel immunotherapeutic agents. This has resulted in the development of two major approaches. First, antigen-specific immunotherapy or cancer vaccination, with the MAGE-A3 vaccine in resected early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the L-BLP25 vaccine in locally advanced NSCLC after chemoradiotherapy and belagenpumatucel-L and the TG4010 vaccine in advanced-stage NSCLC. Second, non-antigen-specific immunotherapy or cancer immunomodulation is reviewed, including how monoclonal antibodies modulate the interaction between antigen-presenting cells, T-lymphocytes and tumor cells (e.g., antibodies against CTLA-4, or against PD-1 receptor or its ligands). Recent Phase II trials with these treatments have shown promising results of efficacy and tolerability, which has led to testing in several large Phase III trials. Some of these are fully recruited, while others are still ongoing, and important results are be expected in the near future.

TI  - Combination of immunotherapy, radiotherapy and denosumab as the best approach even for NSCLC poor prognosis patients: a case report with strong response, prolonged survival and a review of literature
T2  - CURRENT PROBLEMS IN CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) with bone metastasis and poor performance status has the worst prognosis even in strong PD-L1 expression patients. Treatment approach includes immuno-or chemo-immunotherapy, Radiotherapy (RT) and Bone-Targeted Therapy (BTT) but there is insufficient data to sug -gest the best time to use each of them, alone or in combination. Using an integrated and synergistic treat-ment strategy with immunotherapy, radiotherapy, and Denosumab as BTT is probably the best treatment planning for metastatic NSCLC for both good and poor performance status patients, although more data are needed to confirm this approach. Here we describe an interesting case report on patient with ex-tensive bone involvement from NSCLC and PS > 2 treated simultaneously with radiotherapy, immunother-apy and BTT, achieving an excellent clinical benefit, radiological and metabolic complete response, as a sort of Lazarus effect. We analyzed our result comparing with currently published data about radio-immunotherapy or immunotherapy and BTT combination even though there is no published experience about integration of all 3 treatments. Approval studies often do not represent real-world experience (RWE), so we analyzed data from both RWE and clinical trials. (c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Unmet Clinical Need in the Management of Locally Advanced Unresectable Lung Cancer: Treatment Strategies to Improve Patient Outcomes
T2  - ADVANCES IN THERAPY
M3  - Review
AB  - Stage III locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA NSCLC) comprises the most heterogeneous group of patients, accounts for one-third of patients with lung cancer, and is unresectable at presentation. Multiple treatment approaches have evolved over the past few decades focusing on timing of chemoradiation (concurrent vs. sequential) and sequencing of therapy (induction vs. consolidation). Concurrent chemoradiation (CCRT) emerged as the standard of care for the majority of the patients worldwide. Despite improvements in median and overall survival (OS) using the concurrent approach, the rate of distant failure remains high. Consolidation with chemotherapy or targeted agents, adding more radiation dose, or induction chemotherapy did not improve OS. With continued research on defining optimal radiation doses and schedules and integrating novel systemic agents, immunotherapy consolidation has renewed optimism. Synergistic use of radiation and immunotherapy can prevent micrometastatic disease and reduce local failure and may have an abscopal effect in addition to survival benefits. The PACIFIC study reported an absolute progression-free survival benefit of 11.2 months with durvalumab consolidation after standard CCRT compared with placebo. The OS data with durvalumab consolidation are encouraging. Durvalumab is the only approved immunotherapy for unresectable stage III LA NSCLC. Improved survival confirms the definitive role of durvalumab as an effective adjuvant therapy after CCRT with no new safety signals. However, the potential mechanisms driving interaction between immunotherapy and chemoradiotherapy require definitive investigation. These mechanisms may help define the timing of immunotherapy initiation as neoadjuvant, adjuvant, or consolidation and maintenance therapy after progression.

TI  - Intensity-modulated radiation therapy with concurrent chemotherapy followed by durvalumab for stage III non-small cell lung cancer: A multi-center retrospective study
T2  - RADIOTHERAPY AND ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and purpose: Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is increasingly applied in concur-rent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) for locally-advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with improve-ment of target coverage and better sparing of normal tissue. IMRT tends to have a larger low-dose irradiation volume than 3D conformal radiotherapy, but the incidence of and risk factors for pneumonitis remain unclear, especially following the approval of durvalumab. Materials and methods: We retrospectively reviewed the records of NSCLC patients treated by CCRT using IMRT at seven Japanese institutions. Primary outcomes were incidence of symptomatic pneumonitis and progression-free survival (PFS). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify risk factors for >grade 2 pneumonitis. Results: Median follow-up from the start of CCRT was 14.3 months (n = 107 patients; median age 70 years, 29% female). Median lung V5 and V20 was 49.2% and 19.5%, respectively. Durvalumab was administered to 87 patients (81%). Pneumonitis developed in 95 (89%) patients of which 53% had grade 1, 28% grade 2, 6.5% grade 3, and 0.9% grade 4. Durvalumab had been discontinued in 16 patients (18.4%) due to pneu-monitis. By multivariate analysis, age >70 years, male sex, and V5 >58.9% were identified as significantly associated with >grade 2 pneumonitis (p = 0.0065, 0.036 and 0.0013 respectively). The median PFS from the start of CCRT was not reached (95% CI, 14.2 months to not reached) in patients receiving durvalumab. Conclusion: CCRT using IMRT followed by durvalumab was generally effective and tolerable; V5 <60% would be recommended to avoid symptomatic pneumonitis. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

M3  - Article
AB  - The association of adoptive immunotherapy (AI) and radiotherapy has been shown to be effective in the control of residual intrathoracic disease, while having no systemic advantages, in patients operated on for locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The potential synergy of coupling immunotherapy and chemotherapy has been emphasized in several tumors including NSCLC, The aim of this work was to determine the feasibility and activity of a combined therapeutic program, including Al, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy in patients who had undergone incomplete resections for NSCLC, In a phase II trial, 13 patients received the combined treatment. Al was given from week 4 after surgery until week 8. Concurrent chemo(cisplatin and etoposide)-radiotherapy (60 Gy) was given from week 9 to week 14. Twenty eligible patients received chemoradiotherapy only and were used as a nonrandomized concomitant group for merely descriptive purposes. At 9-month followup, 10 of the 13 patients had progression of disease and the study was stopped. Progression-free survival and survival were similar to those of the chemoradiotherapy group. The present study showed that the sequence of immunotherapy followed by chemotherapy is not effective as adjuvant treatment in patients operated on for stage In. NSCLC, at least when used according to the adopted schedule.

TI  - Future Perspectives in the Second Line Therapeutic Setting for Non-Oncogene Addicted Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Simple Summary Despite the use of novel agents in the first-line therapeutic setting, such as PD-1/PDL1 axis blockers for non-oncogene addicted non-small-cell lung cancer, most patients with advanced disease experience progression will succumb to the illness within a short period of time. Currently, the standard second-line treatment consists primarily of systemic cytotoxic therapies, which typically yield poor outcomes. Recently, several novel therapeutic strategies have emerged that may improve patient outcomes. This article reviews current state-of-the-art treatments in this scenario and highlights potential future options.Abstract Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized the management of non-oncogene addicted non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Blocking the anti-PD-1 axis represents the current standard of care in the first-line setting, with drugs administered either as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy. Despite notable successes achieved with ICIs, most of their long-term benefits are restricted to approximately 20% of patients. Consequently, the post-failure treatment landscape after failure to first-line treatment remains a complex challenge. Currently, docetaxel remains the preferred option, although its benefits remain modest as most patients do not respond or progress promptly. In recent times, novel agents and treatment combinations have emerged, offering fresh opportunities to improve patient outcomes. ICIs combined either with antiangiogenic or other novel immunotherapeutic compounds have shown promising preliminary activity. However, more mature data concerning specific combinations do not support their benefit over standard of care. In addition, antibody-drug conjugates seem to be the most promising alternative among all available compounds according to already-published phase I/II data that will be confirmed in soon-to-be-published phase III trial data. In this report, we provide a comprehensive overview of the current second-line treatment options and discuss future therapeutic perspectives.

M3  - Review
AB  - Small-cell, Lung cancer (SCLC) is a smoking-related disease with a poor prognosis. While SCLC is usually initially sensitive to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, responses are rarely Long Lasting. Frustratingly, most patients ultimately relapse, often with increasingly treatment resistant disease. Many strategies have been developed in an attempt to improve treatment outcomes, which have plateaued since the introduction of combination chemotherapy in the 1980s. These include trials of maintenance therapy, and dose intensification, the latter by means of increasing dose density, growth factor support and high dose chemotherapy with autologous stern cell rescue. None have been shown to improve patient survival. On the other hand, the integration of concurrent thoracic radiation and prophylactic cranial irradiation has improved the survival outcomes in patients with Limited disease. In extensive disease, irinotecan combined with cisplatin has shown promise in improving survival over conventional ptatinum/etoposide chemotherapy schedules and a confirmatory study is awaited. The future of SCLC treatment may however Lie with molecularly targeted therapies, such as antiangiogenesis agents and signal transduction inhibitors, which are being studied at present.

TI  - Durvalumab after concurrent chemotherapy and high-dose radiotherapy for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer
T2  - ONCOIMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The standard of care for stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is chemoradiotherapy (CRT) followed by durvalumab. Although doses higher than 66 Gy are standard in our center, they were used in only 6.9% of patients in the PACIFIC trial. We report our experience with durvalumab after high-dose radiotherapy. The database of a tertiary hospital for patients with stage III NSCLC who were treated with CRT and adjuvant durvalumab was evaluated. Progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and local-regional failure (LRF) were measured from the administration of durvalumab. Thirty-nine patients were included. All were treated with intensity-modulated radiation (mean dose 69.9 Gy); Median follow-up time was 20.4 months (range 1-35.4). At 12 months, PFS was 49%, OS 79%, and LRF 14%. Intrathoracic failure at first progression was demonstrated in 8 (21%) patients. Adverse events requiring corticosteroids occurred in 10(25.6%) patients: pneumonitis - 6 (15.4%), hepatitis - 2 (5.1%), and arthralgia and pericarditis - 1 (2.6%). One patient (2.6%) died of pneumonitis. The occurrence of pneumonitis was significantly associated with lung V5 (55% vs. 42%, p = .04) and V20 (28% vs. 19%, p = .01) and mean lung dose (14.8 Gy vs.11.6 Gy, p = .05). The similar 12-month PFS and OS rates of our cohort and the PACIFIC trial support the use of high-dose radiotherapy in patients with stage III NSCLC. Treatment-related mortality was similar to the PACIFIC results. The intrathoracic failure rate in our cohort was lower than that reported from the PACIFIC trial, suggesting that radiation dose escalation may improve local control.

TI  - Phase 2 trial of neoadjuvant toripalimab with chemotherapy for resectable stage III non-small-cell lung cancer
T2  - ONCOIMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Multimodality treatment provides modest survival benefits for patients with locally advanced (stage III) non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Nevertheless, preoperative immunotherapy has continuously been shown to be promising in treating resectable NSCLC.This phase 2 trial enrolled patients with AJCC-defined stage IIIA or T3-4N2 IIIB NSCLC deemed surgically resectable. Patients received three cycles of neoadjuvant treatment with intravenous PD-1 inhibitor toripalimab (240 mg), carboplatin (area under the curve 5), and pemetrexed (500 mg/m(2) for adenocarcinoma) or nab-paclitaxel (260 mg/m(2) for other subtypes) on day 1 of each 21-day cycle. Surgical resection was performed 4-5 weeks afterward. The primary endpoint was major pathological response (MPR), defined as less than 10% residual tumor remaining at the time of surgery.Thirty-three patients were enrolled, of whom 13 (39.4%) had T3-4N2 stage IIIB disease. Thirty (90.9%) patients underwent resection and all except one (96.7%) achieved R0 resection. Twenty patients (60.6%) in the intention-to-treat population achieved an MPR, including 15 patients (45.5%) who achieved a pathological complete response (pCR). The MPR and pCR rates in the per-protocol population were 66.7% and 50.0%, respectively. The surgical complications included three cases of arrhythmias, one case of a prolonged air leak, and one case of chylothorax. The most common grade 3 treatment-related adverse event (TRAE) was anemia (2, [6.1%]). Severe TRAEs included one (3.0%) case of grade 3 peripheral neuropathy that resulted in surgical cancellation.Toripalimab plus platinum-based doublet chemotherapy yields a high MPR rate, manageable toxicity, and feasible resection in stage III NSCLC.Trial ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04304248)

TI  - Safety evaluation of durvalumab for the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer
T2  - EXPERT OPINION ON DRUG SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The development of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), such as anti-programmed death 1/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) inhibitors, has been a breakthrough in the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Durvalumab, a PD-L1 inhibitor, has shown survival benefit as a maintenance therapy for patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC following definitive chemoradiotherapy, and is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency. Areas covered: In this article, we review the development of durvalumab, its pharmacology, and its safety profile as a monotherapy and in combination with other agents, including epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs), ICIs such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) blockers, and cytotoxic chemotherapy. Expert opinion: ICIs, including durvalumab, cause unique side effects, known as immune-mediated adverse events, which are commonly manageable with standard treatment algorithms. The safety profile of durvalumab monotherapy is similar to those of other PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. In the PACIFIC trial, durvalumab after radiotherapy resulted in a slight increase in pulmonary toxicity, but most cases were mild. The enhanced effect of ICIs when used in combination therapies is accompanied by an increased risk of side effects. Therefore, the authors evaluated the safety profile and risk-benefit balance of durvalumab combined with various agents.

TI  - Second-line therapy of squamous non-small cell lung cancer: an evolving landscape
T2  - EXPERT REVIEW OF RESPIRATORY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The treatment of lung cancer has radically changed over the last few years. The discovery of druggable oncogenic alterations and the introduction of immunotherapy have provided lung cancer patients with the possibility of more efficient and less toxic therapeutic alternatives than chemotherapy. In the case of lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC), the treatment progress is slower than adenocarcinoma, for which several targeted agents have been already approved. The standard first-line therapy for LSCC, in most sites of the world, is platinum-based chemotherapy. After disease progression, these patients now have novel treatment options, including antiangiogenic agents and immune checkpoint blockade.Areas covered: We provide a summary of the recent novelties for the second-line therapy of LSCC, emphasizing on the results of the most important clinical trials that have led to regulatory approvals.Expert commentary: Immune checkpoint inhibitors have changed the therapeutic algorithm for LSCC patients. Other treatment options in the second-line setting include ramucirumab in combination with docetaxel and afatinib. However, we still lack biomarkers to predict which patients could respond better to each treatment. Despite the identification of several actionable molecular alterations, there are no approved targeted agents specific for advanced LSCC. Results from ongoing biomarker-driven studies are eagerly awaited to establish effective treatments for molecularly selected subgroups of patients.

TI  - Anti-EGFR and antiangiogenic monoclonal antibodies in metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer
T2  - EXPERT OPINION ON BIOLOGICAL THERAPY
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction: In recent years, several clinical trials have evaluated the efficacy and safety of biological therapies in lung cancer. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the axis vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGF/VEGFR) are targeted by small molecules and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), especially in non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Areas covered: The current state of the art of anti-EGFR and antiangiogenic monoclonal antibodies in metastatic NSCLC is reviewed and discussed.Expert opinion: Bevacizumab and cetuximab are the most studied mAbs in NSCLC, but only bevacizumab is in clinical practice in the first-line setting. Necitumumab is a new anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody that improves survival when combined to cisplatin/gemcitabine chemotherapy and has been approved in first-line advanced NSCLC. Ramucirumab, an antiangiogenic drug binding with high affinity to VEGFR-2, improves the results of chemotherapy alone when administered with docetaxel and has been approved in second-line setting. Moreover, the novel combination of bevacizumab and erlotinib is very promising for the treatment of patients with NSCLC harbouring EGFR mutations. The association of antiangiogenic mAbs and immunotherapy is under investigation too.

TI  - Impact of interstitial lung abnormality on survival after adjuvant durvalumab with chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer
T2  - RADIOTHERAPY AND ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) has been the standard of care for patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC). Background and Purpose: The results of the PACIFIC trial established the use of consolidative durvalumab after concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) as the standard of care for patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC). A subgroup analysis of the PACIFIC trial reported a better progression-free survival (PFS) in Asians. Although real-world data on LA-NSCLC patients who received CCRT plus durvalumab have been reported, there have been few large-scale reports on Asians. In this study, we investigated prognostic factors in the largest real-world data set in Asia of only Japanese LA-NSCLC patients treated with CCRT plus durvalumab. Materials and Methods: One hundred and thirteen LA-NSCLC patients who received definitive CCRT and consolidative durvalumab at our institution between May 2018 and April 2021 were analyzed. Overall survival (OS), cause-specific survival (CSS), PFS, distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), and in-field progression-free survival (IFPFS) were investigated as treatment outcomes using competing risk analyses. Results: During a median follow-up of 24 months (range, 5-47) after the initiation of durvalumab ther-apy, 31 patients died, of whom 23 died of lung cancer. In the multivariate analysis, the pretreatment fac-tors that correlated with OS were ILA scores, adenocarcinoma, and performance status at the initiation of durvalumab. Furthermore, ILA score and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) tumor proportion score (TPS) >= 1 % were significantly correlated with CSS, and PD-L1 TPS >= 1 % was significantly correlated with PFS and IFPFS. Conclusion: Pretreatment ILA, adenocarcinoma, and performance status may have an impact on OS of LA-NSCLC patients receiving CCRT plus durvalumab. (c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Second-Line Treatment Options for Small-Cell Lung Cancer: A Light at the End of the Tunnel
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Small-cell lung cancer accounts for approximately 15% of all lung cancers and for about 30 years it has relied on the same chemo- and radiotherapeutic treatment strategies. Recently, there have been new promising and effective options introduced in the first-line treatment of the extensive stage of the disease, such as immunotherapy with atezolizumab or durvalumab added to standard chemotherapy, and moreover in heavily pretreated patients with new agents such as tarlatamab. This review aims to provide an overview of the current therapeutic strategies in the second-line treatment of small-cell lung cancer with the hope that we will finally begin to see a light at the end of the tunnel.Abstract Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a subtype of lung tumor characterized by rapid growth and early metastatic dissemination. It represents approximately 15% of all diagnosed lung cancers, with an annual incidence of over 200,000 cases worldwide. At the time of initial diagnosis, approximately 75-80% of patients already have extrathoracic spread. Almost all patients with SCLC also relapse after achieving a complete response with first-line treatment. Outcomes achievable in second-line treatment are related to the length of time between completion of first-line therapy and disease progression. While first-line chemo-immunotherapy remains the standard of care for initial management, the role of second-line treatment strategies in SCLC has been a topic of significant research and discussion. Second-line treatment options are limited and the results are still disappointing. Several molecules are currently being studied in lines following the first, using immunological targets and cell cycle checkpoints. Among these, particular interest has been placed on anti-PD-1 (programmed cell death-1 protein) and anti-PD-L1 (programmed cell death-ligand 1) monoclonal antibodies, and DLL3 (Delta-like ligand 3), which are being evaluated alone or in combination. Tarlatamab is a novel promising therapeutic antibody currently under investigation for its potential use in previously treated SCLC patients. This mini-review will explore the current state of second-line treatment options for SCLC, their clinical efficacy, and future directions.

TI  - Optimal drugs for second-line treatment of patients with small-cell lung cancer
T2  - EXPERT OPINION ON PHARMACOTHERAPY
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction: Despite the high response rate to chemotherapy, there have been few advances in the treatment of small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) in the last decades. The state-of-the-art second-line therapy and future research developments in relapsed SCLC are reviewed.Areas covered: There are no optimal drugs for second-line treatment of recurrent SCLC but only agents registered for this use. Topotecan remains the standard-of-care for the treatment of second-line platinum-sensitive SCLC patients worldwide, while amrubicin is another option, but registered only in Japan. To date, no targeted agents reporting interesting results in second-line SCLC treatment are available. The next-generation DNA sequencing should discover somatic gene alterations and their roles in SCLC to help in selecting patients who could benefit from a targeted agent. Two immunotherapeutics, ipilimumab and nivolumab, have shown promising preliminary results and are being investigated in ongoing trials.Expert opinion: Second-line treatment is not an option for most SCLC patients. Given the evidence up to now, the potentials for immuno-oncology in SCLC are high. The hope is that these expectations are met, and that all drugs being developed will offer new and improved treatment options for SCLC patients.

TI  - The Era of Immunotherapy in Small-Cell Lung Cancer: More Shadows Than Light?
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Simple Summary Small-cell lung cancer is the most aggressive form of lung neoplasia, treated in recent decades with chemotherapy alone. In the last few years, the advent of immunotherapy has changed the landscape in the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer, and in small-cell lung cancer as well. However, the effectiveness of immunotherapy and the potential predictors of the response are still not completely established. This review aims to investigate the current knowledge in this field.Abstract Small-cell lung cancer is an extremely chemo-sensitive disease; the addition of immunotherapy to chemotherapy has demonstrated a slight clinical benefit in pivotal trials, even with a statistically significant difference in terms of survival outcomes when compared to chemotherapy alone. In this scenario, the role of radiotherapy as a consolidation treatment in thoracic disease or as a prophylactic therapy in the brain should be clarified. In addition, due to the frailty and the poor prognostic characteristics of these patients, the need for predictive biomarkers that could support the use of immunotherapy is crucial. PD-L1 and TMB are not actually considered definitive biomarkers due to the heterogeneity of results in the literature. A new molecular classification of small-cell lung cancer based on the expression of key transcription factors seems to clarify the disease behavior, but the knowledge of this molecular subtype is still insufficient and the application in clinical practice far from reality; this classification could lead to a better understanding of SCLC disease and could provide the right direction for more personalized treatment. The aim of this review is to investigate the current knowledge in this field, evaluating whether there are predictive biomarkers and clinical patient characteristics that could help us to identify those patients who are more likely to respond to immunotherapy.

TI  - Immunotherapy of Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Facts and Hopes
T2  - CLINICAL CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Treatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the advanced stage remains a great challenge, with very few drugs approved. After decades of failure of immune therapies, immune checkpoint inhibitors have emerged as potentially effective treatments for patients with HCC in the advanced stage. Immune checkpoints, including human cancer, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte protein 4 (CTLA-4), and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), are surface proteins expressed in a variety of immune cells and mostly provide immunosuppressive signals. Monoclonal antibodies able to block these molecules have shown antitumor activity against a wide spectrum of human cancers. Clinical experience with checkpoint inhibitors in HCC includes early trials with the anti-CTLA-4 agent tremelimumab and a large phase II trial with the anti-PD-1 agent nivolumab. The latter has shown strong activity particularly as second-line therapy, both in terms of tumor response and patient survival. At least three topics should be the focus of future research: (i) the search for activity in patients at less-advanced stages, including the adjuvant treatment of patients with resectable or ablatable tumors; (ii) the enhanced efficacy of combination therapies, including particularly the combination with those targeted and locoregional therapies that may have a synergistic effect or act upon mechanisms of primary or acquired resistance to checkpoint inhibitors; and (iii) the identification of clinical features and serumor tissue biomarkers that would allow a better patient selection for individual treatments. Hopefully, ongoing trials will help to design better treatments in the future. (C) 2017 AACR.

TI  - Efficacy of local therapy for oligoprogressive disease after programmed cell death 1 blockade in advanced non-small cell lung cancer
T2  - CANCER SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have dramatically changed the strategy used to treat patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC); however, the vast majority of patients eventually develop progressive disease (PD) and acquire resistance to ICIs. Some patients experience oligoprogressive disease. Few retrospective studies have evaluated clinical efficacy in patients with oligometastatic progression who received local therapy after ICI treatment. We conducted a retrospective analysis of advanced NSCLC patients who received PD-1 inhibitor monotherapy with nivolumab or pembrolizumab to evaluate the effects of ICIs on the patterns of progression and the efficacy of local therapy for oligoprogressive disease. Of the 307 patients treated with ICIs, 148 were evaluated in our study; 42 were treated with pembrolizumab, and 106 were treated with nivolumab. Thirty-eight patients showed oligoprogression. Male sex, a lack of driver mutations, and smoking history were significantly correlated with the risk of oligoprogression. Primary lesions were most frequently detected at oligoprogression sites (15 patients), and 6 patients experienced abdominal lymph node (LN) oligoprogression. Four patients showed evidence of new abdominal LN oligometastases. There was no significant difference in overall survival (OS) between the local therapy group and the switch therapy group (reached vs. not reached, P = .456). We summarized clinical data on the response of oligoprogressive NSCLC to ICI therapy. The results may help to elucidate the causes of ICI resistance and indicate that the use of local therapy as the initial treatment in this setting is feasible treatment option.

T2  - EXPERT OPINION ON INVESTIGATIONAL DRUGS
M3  - Review
AB  - Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is characterised by neuroendocrine differentiation, early metastatic potential and initial responsiveness to cytotoxic therapy. Unfortunately, despite recent therapeutic advances, most patients relapse and the overall five-year survival rate is only 5%. Standard treatment of SCLC consists of platinum-based combination chemotherapy, with thoracic irradiation added for patients with limited-stage disease. Several newer chemotherapeutic drugs have recently been shown to have significant activity in patients with untreated or relapsed SCLC. These agents include: the topoisomerase I inhibitors, topotecan and irinotecan; the taxanes, paclitaxel and docetaxel; the pyrimidine analogue, gemcitabine; and the vinca alkaloid, vinorelbine. Recent advances in our understanding of the molecular events involved in the pathogenesis and progression of SCLC have led to the identification of a variety of potential targets for novel therapeutic intenrentions. Strategies aimed at inhibiting the myriad of growth factor pathways that. control the proliferation of SCLC cells, include: broad spectrum neuropeptide antagonists (e.g., substance P analogues); growth factor/receptor-specific inhibitors (e.g., anti-GRP monoclonal antibodies, bradykinin antagonist dimers); and a variety of selective protein kinase inhibitors. The importance of cell death pathways in carcinogenesis and treatment-resistance has led to several novel strategies targeting apoptotic mediators, such as bcl-2, that are frequently dysregulated in SCLC (e.g., bcl-2 antisense). Our current challenges are to further refine these promising therapeutic strategies, efficiently evaluate their activity in the clinical setting and integrate them into more effective treatment regimens to improve the overall prognosis of patients with SCLC.

TI  - PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint blockades in non-small cell lung cancer: New development and challenges
T2  - CANCER LETTERS
M3  - Review
AB  - PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint blockades have dramatically changed the landscape for second-line treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Based on the promising results of Keynote-024 presented so far, pembrolizumab has been approved as first-line treatment for advanced PD-L1 positive NSCLC patients. However, overall response rate (ORR) is limited to PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint blockades when used as single agent. Combining with chemotherapy, anti-CTLA-4 antibodies, targeted therapy, radiotherapy or other treatment options is perceived as an appealing method aimed at achieving higher efficacy. There are many clinical trials on going or finished assessing the efficacy and safety of the PD-1/PD-L1 blockades alone or combining with other approaches in first-line or second-line treatments. A lot of challenges need to be overcome before PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint blockades are widely used in the patients with NSCLC including the identification of optimal combination, treatment-related adverse effects, the high cost and lack of effective predictive markers. In this review, we focus on outlining current clinical trials and challenges for future research of PD-1/PD-L1 pathway checkpoint blockades in NSCLC. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

T2  - CLINICAL & TRANSLATIONAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionThe neutrophil-to-lymphocyte (ANC/ALC) ratio is associated with worse prognosis in patients with NSCLC on immunotherapies, but the role of ALC remains unclear. The previous radiation therapy causes lymphopenia, and given approaches of combining radiation with immunotherapies, it is critical to better understand the impact of peripheral lymphocytes.Patients and methodsWe evaluated retrospectively 22 patients with advanced NSCLC treated with nivolumab at Boston Medical Center from January 2014 to September 2016 and correlated the peripheral blood counts with the overall survival (OS) and overall time on treatment. We assessed the effect of the previous radiation on peripheral blood counts and clinical outcomes.ResultsBaseline ALC and ANC/ALC ratios are positively and negatively correlated, respectively, with the OS on nivolumab. The ALC and ALC/WBC ratios at 6weeks on treatment are positively associated with the OS. Kaplan-Meier analysis at baseline and at 6weeks showed significantly increased OS in the group of patients with the highest ALC. The previous radiation therapy was positively correlated with the ANC and negatively correlated with the ALC/WBC ratio at 8weeks after the initiation of nivolumab.ConclusionOur finding that ALC at baseline and at 6weeks on treatment is positively correlated with the OS provides an easily obtained predictive marker. Our result that the previous radiation is associated with higher ANC and lower ALC during treatment supports that the combination of radiation therapy with immunotherapy should be carefully applied and potentially peripheral blood counts can be utilized to stratify patients for this approach.

TI  - Pharmacological ascorbate improves the response to platinum-based chemotherapy in advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer
T2  - REDOX BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Platinum-based chemotherapy with or without immunotherapy is the mainstay of treatment for advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) lacking a molecular driver alteration. Pre-clinical studies have reported that pharmacological ascorbate (P-AscH-) enhances NSCLC response to platinum-based therapy. We conducted a phase II clinical trial combining P-AscH-with carboplatin-paclitaxel chemotherapy. Experimental design: Chemotherapy naive advanced stage NSCLC patients received 75 g ascorbate twice per week intravenously with carboplatin and paclitaxel every three weeks for four cycles. The primary endpoint was to improve tumor response per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 compared to the historical control of 20%. The trial was conducted as an optimal Simon's two-stage design. Blood samples were collected for exploratory analyses. Results: The study enrolled 38 patients and met its primary endpoint with an objective response rate of 34.2% (p = 0.03). All were confirmed partial responses (cPR). The disease control rate was 84.2% (stable disease + cPR). Median progression-free and overall survival were 5.7 months and 12.8 months, respectively. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAE) included one grade 5 (neutropenic fever) and five grade 4 events (cytopenias). Cytokine and chemokine data suggest that the combination elicits an immune response. Immunophenotyping of peripheral blood mononuclear cells demonstrated an increase in effector CD8 T-cells in patients with a progression-free survival (PFS) >= 6 months. Conclusions: The addition of P-AscH-to platinum-based chemotherapy improved tumor response in advanced stage NSCLC. P-AscH-appears to alter the host immune response and needs further investigation as a potential adjuvant to immunotherapy.

TI  - Comparison Between <SUP>18</SUP>F-FDG PET-Based and CT-Based Criteria in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients Treated with Nivolumab
T2  - JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Because of the peculiar mechanism of action of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), evaluation of the radiologic response to them in solid tumors presents many challenges. We aimed to compare evaluation of the first response to nivolumab by means of CT-based criteria with respect to F-18-FDG PET response criteria in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Methods: Seventy-two patients with advanced NSCLC were recruited in a single-institution ancillary trial within the expanded-access program (NCT02475382) for nivolumab. Patients underwent CT and F-18-FDG PET at baseline and after 4 cycles (the first evaluation). In cases of progressive disease, an additional evaluation was performed after 2 further cycles to confirm progression. We evaluated the treatment response on CT using RECIST 1.1 and the immune-related response criteria (irRC) and on F-18-FDG PET using PERCIST and immunotherapy-modified PERCIST. The concordance between CT- and PET-based criteria and the capability of each method to predict overall survival were evaluated. Results: Forty-eight of 72 patients were evaluable for a first response assessment with both PET- and CT-based criteria. We observed low concordance between CT- and PET-based criteria (K-value of 0.346 and 0.355 between PERCIST and imPERCIST and RECIST, respectively. K-value of 0.128 and 0.198 between PERCIST and imPERCIST and irRC, respectively). Regarding overall survival, irRC could more reliably distinguish responders from nonresponders. However, thanks to the prognostic value of partial metabolic response assessed by both PERCIST and immunotherapy-modified PERCIST, PET-based response maintained prognostic significance in patients classified as having progressive disease on the basis of irRC. Conclusion: Even though the present study did not support the routine use of F-18-FDG PET in the general population of NSCLC patients treated with ICIs, the findings suggest that metabolic response assessment has added prognostic value, potentially improving therapeutic decision making.

TI  - Unravelling the biology of SCLC: implications for therapy
T2  - NATURE REVIEWS CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive malignancy associated with a poor prognosis. First-line treatment has remained unchanged for decades, and a paucity of effective treatment options exists for recurrent disease. Nonetheless, advances in our understanding of SCLC biology have led to the development of novel experimental therapies. Poly [ ADP-ribose] polymerase (PARP) inhibitors have shown promise in preclinical models, and are under clinical investigation in combination with cytotoxic therapies and inhibitors of cell-cycle checkpoints. Preclinical data indicate that targeting of histone-lysine N-methyltransferase EZH2, a regulator of chromatin remodelling implicated in acquired therapeutic resistance, might augment and prolong chemotherapy responses. High expression of the inhibitory Notch ligand Delta-like protein 3 (DLL3) in most SCLCs has been linked to expression of Achaete-scute homologue 1 (ASCL1; also known as ASH-1), a key transcription factor driving SCLC oncogenesis; encouraging preclinical and clinical activity has been demonstrated for an anti-DLL3-antibody-drug conjugate. The immune microenvironment of SCLC seems to be distinct from that of other solid tumours, with few tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes and low levels of the immune-checkpoint protein programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1). Nonetheless, immunotherapy with immune-checkpoint inhibitors holds promise for patients with this disease, independent of PD-L1 status. Herein, we review the progress made in uncovering aspects of the biology of SCLC and its microenvironment that are defining new therapeutic strategies and offering renewed hope for patients.

TI  - Durvalumab after definitive chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced NSCLC: Data of the German EAP
T2  - DATA IN BRIEF
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Following the PACIFIC trial, durvalumab has been approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for consolidation of locally advanced PD-L1-positive NSCLC after chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Patients were treated with durvalumab in the EAP from 22.11.2017 to 15.10.2018 allowing analysis of its efficacy and safety.211 patients were registered by 90 German centres. Data were collected retrospectively by questionnaire and queries. 56 centres reported data on 126 patients who actually received at least one cycle of durvalumab. In contrast to the PACIFIC-trial population, some patients with oligometastatic disease and a history of autoimmune disease are included in the EAP population. Information on PD-L1 status was obtained for 111 patients. Baseline data include age, gender, ECOG, stage (IASLC 8th ed.), and smoking history. Treatment data include mode of chemoradiotherapy, used chemotherapy agent, and duration of durvalumab therapy. Adverse evants were documented according to CTAEC 5.0. Data were analysed for progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and adverse events (AE). The results were published in Lung Cancer [1]. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

TI  - Thoracic radiotherapy may improve the outcome of extensive stage small cell lung carcinoma patients treated with first-line immunotherapy plus chemotherapy
T2  - ANTI-CANCER DRUGS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Immunotherapy plus etoposide and platinum (EP)-based chemotherapy is the standard of care for patients with extensive stage-small cell lung carcinoma (ES-SCLC). In the era of immunotherapy, the role of thoracic radiotherapy for ES-SCLC remains unclear. Methods We retrospectively included ES-SCLC patients treated with first-line EP-based chemotherapy plus atezolizumab or durvalumab at Taichung Veterans General Hospital to evaluate the prognostic role and safety of thoracic radiotherapy. Results A total of 22 patients were included. The median age was 64 years and most of them were male and smokers. Sixteen patients (72.7%) received durvalumab, while the other 6 patients (27.3%) underwent atezolizumab treatment. Among these patients, 11 (50.0%) had a history of thoracic radiotherapy. There was no significant difference in baseline characteristics between patients with and without thoracic radiotherapy. In the overall population, the objective response rate to immunotherapy plus chemotherapy was 73.7%. The progression-free survival and overall survival were 6.0 months (95% CI: 4.0-7.9) and 13.8 months (95% CI: 8.0-19.6), respectively. The overall survival was significantly longer in patients with thoracic radiotherapy (not-reached [NR] [95% CI NR-NR] vs. 9.6 months [95% CI 2.5-16.6]), respectively (P value by log-rank test <0.001). Both multivariate analysis and subgroup analysis specifically comparing patients with consolidative thoracic radiotherapy and patients with clinical benefits to systemic therapy who did not undergo thoracic radiotherapy indicated that thoracic radiotherapy improved survival. Conclusion The real-world efficacy of EP-based chemotherapy plus atezolizumab or durvalumab was comparable with that of clinical trials. Thoracic radiotherapy may improve the outcome of ES-SCLC.

TI  - Understanding Total Cost of Care in Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Pre- and Postapproval of Immuno-Oncology Therapies
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MANAGED CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study assesses resource utilization and total direct medical cost among patients in the United States starting systemic antineoplastic therapy (ST) pre- and postapproval of immuno-oncology (IO) agents for advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Adults diagnosed with lung cancer initiating first-line ST within 6 months of diagnosis during either the pre-(March 2013-March 2014) or post-IO (March 2015-December 2016) approval period were identified in a US-based multipayer administrative claims database. Excluded were patients with small cell lung cancer, secondary malignancies, less than 1 month follow-up, and those in clinical trials. Total cost (TC) was calculated from the date of initiation of treatment until the last follow-up. Propensity score matching was adjusted for differences in patient cohorts, including follow-up time. Binary multiple logistic regression assessed predictors of high TC (above mean) pre- and post IO. Mean TC per patient was higher pre-IO versus post IO in both unmatched ($165,548 vs $95,715) and matched analyses ($129,977 vs $113,177). Hospitalization and emergency department (ED) visit rates were higher pre-IO versus postapproval. Predictors of high TC pre-IO included use of first-line combination therapy, radiation, targeted therapy, maintenance therapy, biomarker testing, more comorbidities, longer follow-up, first-line hospitalization, first-line cost above mean, and age 65 years and older. In the post-IO period, additional predictors of higher TC included use of IO, having mild liver disease or hemiplegia, and longer time to ST initiation. Early data show lower ED visit and hospitalization rates and associated lower TC in the post-IO era.

M3  - Review
AB  - Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a high-grade neuroendocrine tumor characterized by rapid growth, early metastatic spread, and initial responsiveness to therapy. Although the incidence of SCLC is declining, it remains one of the common causes of cancer related mortality. Initial evaluation of patients with SCLC should focus on determining the extent of disease and the ability of the patient to tolerate specific therapy. Positron emission tomography (PET) can improve the accuracy of staging and treatment planning in many patients. Limited-stage (LS) SCLC is a potentially curable disease with long-term survival of 20 to 25% when treated with platinum-based chemotherapy plus concurrent thoracic radiation. Hyperfractionated (twice daily) thoracic radiation and prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) may improve survival in selected patients with LS-SCLC. For patients with extensive-stage (ES) SCLC, combination chemotherapy prolongs survival and improves quality of life, but long-term survival is rare. The use of PCI and sequential thoracic radiation has been reported to improve survival in selected patients with ES-SCLC. Many chemotherapeutic drugs have activity in SCLC, but little progress has been made in the systemic treatment of SCLC in almost three decades. Although many potential molecular targets have been identified in the preclinical studies of SCLC, molecularly targeted therapy has yet to demonstrate consistent clinical activity. Nevertheless, future advances in SCLC will depend on the development of rational therapeutic strategies which target the molecular mechanisms that drive cellular proliferation, survival, and immunological avoidance.

TI  - Coriolus versicolor polysaccharide peptide slows progression of advanced non-small cell lung cancer
T2  - RESPIRATORY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a leading cause of cancer deaths, and over 60% of patients present with advanced stages. Although polysaccharide peptides (PSP), isolated from the fungus Coriolus versicolor, have been reported to have anti-tumor effects, its clinical efficacy has not been properly evaluated. Methods: Double-blind placelbo-controlled randomized study to evaluate the effects of 28-day administration of PSP (Windsor Pharmaceutical, Hong Kong) on patients, who had completed conventional treatment for advanced NSCLC. Results: Thirty-four patients, with no significant difference in their baseline demographic, clinical or tumor characteristics, or previous treatment regimes (P>0.05), were recruited into each of the PSP and control arms. After 28-day treatment, there was a significant improvement in blood leukocyte and neutrophil counts, serum IgG and IgM, and percent of body fat among the PSP, but not the control, patients (P<0.05). Although the evaluable PSP patients did not improve in NSCLC-reated symptoms, there were significantly less PSP patients withdrawn due to disease progression, than their control counterparts (5.9 and 23.5%, respectively; P=0.04; OR 4.00). There was no reported adverse reaction attributable to the trial medications. Conclusion: PSP treatment appears to be associated with slower deterioration in patients with advanced NSCLC.

TI  - Impact of Treatment-Related Lymphopenia on Immunotherapy for Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION ONCOLOGY BIOLOGY PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: The interest in combining radiation therapy (RT) with immunotherapy is increasing. We investigated the significance of lymphopenia in patients receiving immunotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and the factors associated with treatment-related lymphopenia, with particular emphasis on RT.Methods and Methods: In this retrospective single institution study, 268 patients with advanced NSCLC received immunotherapy, of whom 146 received RT. Lymphopenia was defined as an absolute lymphocyte count <1000cells/mm.(3) Patients were divided into 2 groups depending on the presence of peri-immunotherapy lymphopenia at the start of immunotherapy or during immunotherapy.Results: At median 6.4 months of follow-up, patients with peri-immunotherapy lymphopenia (n = 146; 54.5%) showed significantly poorer progression-free survival (PFS) (median PFS: 2.2 vs 5.9 months, P<.001) and overall survival (OS) (median OS: 5.7 vs 12.1 months, P<.001). On multivariate analysis, peri-immunotherapy lymphopenia remained a significant prognostic factor for both PFS and OS. RT significantly increased peri-immunotherapy lymphopenia with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.91 (P = .025). Factors associated with the development of RT-associated lymphopenia included multiple courses (OR, 3.78; P<.001), multiple irradiated sites (OR, 4.77; P = .018), and higher dose (>= 50Gy) (OR, 3.75; P = .004). Conversely, stereotactic body RT/radiosurgery reduced the risk (OR 0.21; P = .002).Conclusions: Lymphopenia was indicative of poor prognosis in NSCLC patients receiving immunotherapy and was significantly associated with more intensive RT. Choosing appropriate RT regimens and techniques may be essential in reducing lymphopenia. Promising results are expected in the era of precision RT. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Nivolumab and brain metastases in patients with advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer
T2  - LUNG CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Brain metastases are common among patients with non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and result in a poor prognosis. Consequently, such patients are often excluded from clinical trials. In Italy an expanded access program (EAP) was used to evaluate nivolumab efficacy and safety in this sub population outside a clinical trial.Materials and methods: In this EAP, nivolumab was available for patients with non-squamous NSCLC in progression after at least one systemic treatment for stage IIIB/IV disease. Nivolumab 3 mg/kg was administered intravenously every 2 weeks. Patients with brain metastases could be included if they were asymptomatic, neurologically stable and either off corticosteroids or on a stable or decreasing dose of <= 10 mg/day prednisone.Results: 409 out of 1588 patients included had asymptomatic or controlled brain metastases. A median of 7 doses (range 1-45) were delivered. Median follow-up was 6.1 months (range 0.1-21.9). The disease control rate was 39%: 4 patients had a complete response, 64 a partial response and 96 showed stable disease. At baseline, 118 patients were on corticosteroids and 74 were undergoing concomitant radiotherapy. The median overall survival in this subpopulation was 8.6 months (95% CI: 6.4-10.8). 337 discontinued treatment for various reasons, 23 (7%) of whom due to adverse events, in line with that observed in the overall population and in previous studies.Conclusions: Our results confirm that nivolumab is active in non-squamous NSCLC patients with brain metastases, despite their poor prognosis. Its safety profile is also concordant with results in the EAP overall population and in patients with other malignancies.

TI  - Baseline PD-L1 expression and tumour-infiltrated lymphocyte status predict the efficacy of durvalumab consolidation therapy after chemoradiotherapy in unresectable locally advanced patients with non-small-cell lung cancer
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Chemoradiotherapy (CRT) followed by durvalumab treatment improved prognosis in unresectable locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (LANSCLC). This study aimed to evaluate whether the status of the immune-related tumour microenvironment (TME) at baseline associates with the efficacy.Methods: This retrospective study evaluated immune-related TME factors, including programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) (clone: 22C3) expression on tumour cells and the density of CD8-positive tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) at pre-CRT in patients with unresectable LA-NSCLC treated with CRT only (CRT alone group) and those treated with CRT followed by durvalumab (Durva group).Results: A total of 551 patients were included (N = 113 in the Durva group). Progression-free survival (PFS) in the Durva group was significantly greater than that in the CRT alone group (not reached [NR] vs 12.9 months; p = 0.002). In the CRT alone group, neither PD-L1 expres-sion nor TIL status affected PFS; in contrast, in the Durva group, high density of CD8-positive TILs (TILHigh >100/mm2) and PD-L1-positive expression (tumour proportion score >1%; PD-L1+) was significantly associated with longer PFS (TIL: NR vs 9.5 months; p = 0.002; and PD-L1: NR vs 7.7 months; p = 0.003). On the other hand, in patients with epidermal growth factor receptor mutations or anaplastic lymphoma kinase rearrangements, there was no significant difference in PFS between the groups (Durva vs CRT alone: 9.9 months vs 14.0 months; p = 0.77).Conclusions: PD-L1+ and TILHigh at baseline could be predictive markers of the efficacy of CRT followed by durvalumab.(c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Pembrolizumab as a first line therapy in a patient with extensive mucoepidermoid salivary gland carcinoma. A complete clinical, radiological and pathological response. A very specific case
T2  - DISCOVER ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Patients with advanced salivary gland malignancies (SGCs) have few therapy options. Although results from newly published trials suggest that checkpoint inhibition may be useful in a subgroup of patients, there are no clear criteria for PD-L1 score in SGCs. Chemotherapy benefits were observed to be limited, with a dismal prognosis in unresectable and high-grade SGC. Immunotherapies have demonstrated extraordinary efficacy in a variety of cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer and malignant melanoma. Anti-PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab has been shown to have potent anti-tumor action in a number of clinical trials. Case presentation We report a unique case of advanced high grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the parotid salivary gland after Pembrolizumab treatment as a first line therapy. The tumor was downstaged as a result of the pembrolizumab treatment, allowing for a successful surgical excision with no facial nerve sacrifice and no major neoadjuvant treatment adverse effects, and the final specimen pathology was tumor-free. In these types of malignancies, a similar technique resulted in a complete response (CR) radiologically and pathologically has never been discussed before. Conclusions In pretreated patients with high-grade salivary gland mucoepidermoid carcinoma, pembrolizumab showed good anticancer activity and provided a clinically, radiologically, and pathological response with a viable treatment choice. More research is needed to bring Pembrolizumab to the front-line of treatment. The time and duration of medication should be compared to the time required for surgery in these investigations.

M3  - Review
AB  - All lung cancer patients should have slides reviewed by a pathologist familiar with a WHO oriented classification system. Serial measurements of levels of marker substances to determine their value in assessing completeness of remission and early relapses should be performed. Routine staging procedures should include evaluation of liver, bone, bone marrow, and brain. Other staging procedures including peritoneoscopy, lymphangiography and radionuclide scanning should be further evaluated in clinical investigation protocols. The prognostic importance of metastases to each organ should be determined. Bronchoscopy is a useful tool for evaluating response to therapy. Extent of disease, age, sex, performance status, prior therapy and immune status should be reported in all trials. Surgery appears to have little value except in peripheral solitary nodules. Adjuvant chemotherapy should be studied in these cases. Chemotherapy plus radiotherapy is superior to radiotherapy alone, even in limited disease. When effective combination chemotherapy is used, radiotherapy to the chest does not clearly increase survival over chemotherapy alone. Prophylactic CNS therapy with cranial irradiation or a systemic nitrosourea is useful in reducing brain metastases. Despite the increased response rates and survivals attributed to combination chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy, few patients are cured and long periods of treatment are necessary. New chemotherapeutic and radiotherapeutic tactics are necessary for further improvements. Increasing the intensity of induction therapy has led to considerable increases in response rate, survival and toxicity.

TI  - Acute hospitalizations after proton therapy versus intensity-modulated radiotherapy for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer in the durvalumab era
T2  - CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction It was hypothesized that use of proton beam therapy (PBT) in patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer treated with concurrent chemoradiation and consolidative immune checkpoint inhibition is associated with fewer unplanned hospitalizations compared with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). Methods Patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer treated between October 2017 and December 2021 with concurrent chemoradiation with either IMRT or PBT +/- consolidative immune checkpoint inhibition were retrospectively identified. Logistic regression was used to assess the association of radiation therapy technique with 90-day hospitalization and grade 3 (G3+) lymphopenia. Competing risk regression was used to compare G3+ pneumonitis, G3+ esophagitis, and G3+ cardiac events. Kaplan-Meier method was used for progression-free survival and overall survival. Inverse probability treatment weighting was applied to adjust for differences in PBT and IMRT groups. Results Of 316 patients, 117 (37%) received PBT and 199 (63%) received IMRT. The PBT group was older (p < .001) and had higher Charlson Comorbidity Index scores (p = .02). The PBT group received a lower mean heart dose (p < .0001), left anterior descending artery V15 Gy (p = .001), mean lung dose (p = .008), and effective dose to immune circulating cells (p < .001). On inverse probability treatment weighting analysis, PBT was associated with fewer unplanned hospitalizations (adjusted odds ratio, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.38-0.81; p = .002) and less G3+ lymphopenia (adjusted odds ratio, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.37-0.81; p = .003). There was no difference in other G3+ toxicities, progression-free survival, or overall survival. Conclusions PBT is associated with fewer unplanned hospitalizations, lower effective dose to immune circulating cells and less G3+ lymphopenia compared with IMRT. Minimizing dose to lymphocytes may be warranted, but prospective data are needed.

TI  - Evolving landscape of treatments targeting the microenvironment of liver metastases in non-small cell lung cancer
T2  - CHINESE MEDICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Review
AB  - Liver metastases (LMs) are common in lung cancer. Despite substantial advances in diagnosis and treatment, the survival rate of patients with LM remains low as the immune-suppressive microenvironment of the liver allows tumor cells to evade the immune system. The impact of LMs on the outcomes of immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with solid tumors has been the main focus of recent translational and clinical research. Growing evidence indicates that the hepatic microenvironment delivers paracrine and autocrine signals from non-parenchymal and parenchymal cells. Overall, these microenvironments create pre- and post-metastatic conditions for the progression of LMs. Herein, we reviewed the epidemiology, physiology, pathology and immunology, of LMs associated with non-small cell lung cancer and the role and potential targets of the liver microenvironment in LM in each phase of metastasis. Additionally, we reviewed the current treatment strategies and challenges that should be overcome in preclinical and clinical investigations. These approaches target liver elements as the basis for future clinical trials, including combinatorial interventions reported to resolve hepatic immune suppression, such as immunotherapy plus chemotherapy, immunotherapy plus radiotherapy, immunotherapy plus anti-angiogenesis therapy, and surgical resection.

TI  - Immune checkpoint inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC): Approaches on special subgroups and unresolved burning questions
T2  - CANCER TREATMENT REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have been incorporated in the treatment strategy of advanced non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Beyond the already approved indications in first- and second-line setting of advanced NSCLC, new data has recently emerged demonstrating its efficacy in locally advanced disease as maintenance after chemo-radiotherapy and currently several trials are also exploring its efficacy in earlier stages of the disease to evaluate whether these results could be extrapolated to the adjuvant setting. With the advent of all these new therapies, their potential in other thoracic malignancies such as mesothelioma and small-cell lung cancer are also being evaluated with encouraging preliminary data that endorses their short-term incorporation as new therapeutic options in these thoracic malignancies. However, despite all these new evidence, there are still several open questions that remain to be solved like the use of immune agents in special subpopulations such as elderly or fragile patients or the case of patients with brain metastases or autoimmune disorders. In addition some other open questions remain with regards ICIs activity in patients receiving corticosteroid or antibiotics, the potential use in oncogenic addicted tumours, as well as the safety of retreatment after the onset of immune-related adverse events (ir-AE) or the optimal dose schedule or time on treatment for ICIs administration. Herein, we propose to address all these questions, reviewing most recent evidence available in order to give readers some practical advises and guidance on how to deal with these challenges when treating NSCLC patients with immunotherapy.

TI  - Radiochemotherapy combined with NK cell transfer followed by second-line PD-1 inhibition in apatient with NSCLC stage IIIb inducing long-term tumor control: acase study
T2  - STRAHLENTHERAPIE UND ONKOLOGIE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundMembrane heat shock protein 70 (mHsp70) is indicative of high-risk tumors and serves as atumor-specific target for natural killer (NK) cells stimulated with Hsp70 peptide (TKD) and Interleukin(IL)-2. Radiochemotherapy (RCT), mHsp70-targeting NK cells, and programmed death(PD)-1 inhibition were combined to improve the efficacy of tumor-specific immune cells in anon-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) patient.PatientFollowing simultaneous RCT (64.8Gy), apatient with inoperable NSCLC (cT4, cN3, cM0, stage IIIb) was treated with 4cycles of autologous ex vivo TKD/IL-2-activated NK cells and the PD-1 antibody nivolumab as asecond-line therapy. Blood samples were taken for immunophenotyping during the course of therapy.ResultsAdoptive transfer of ex vivo TKD/IL-2-activated NK cells after RCT combined with PD-1 blockade is well tolerated and results in superior overall survival (OS). No viable tumor cells but amassive immune cell infiltration in fibrotic tissue was detected after therapy. Neither tumor progression nor distant metastases were detectable by CT scanning 33months after diagnosis. Therapy response was associated with significantly increased CD3(-)/NKG2D(+)/CD94(+) NK cell counts, elevated CD8(+) to CD4(+) Tcell and CD3(-)/CD56(bright) to CD3(-)/CD56(dim) NK cell ratios, and significantly reduced regulatory Tcells (Tregs) in the peripheral blood.ConclusionAcombined therapy consisting of RCT, mHsp70-targeting NK cells, and PD-1 antibody inhibition is well tolerated, induces anti-tumor immunity, and results in long-term tumor control in one patient with advanced NSCLC. Further, randomized studies are necessary to confirm the efficacy of this combination therapy.

TI  - Durvalumab Outcomes in Stage III Non-small Cell Lung Cancer: A Single-institution Study
T2  - ANTICANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background/Aim: The PACIFIC trial demonstrated improved survival in patients with unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with durvalumab following definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT). This study sought to explore real- world outcomes with durvalumab consolidation therapy at our institution. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively identified patients diagnosed with stage III NSCLC at our institution from January 2012 to January 2022. We created two cohorts: one who received durvalumab following definitive CRT and a historical one who did not. Primary outcomes of interest included median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Additionally, we performed subgroup analysis on the durvalumab cohort to explore the associations between survival and time to durvalumab initiation, PD-L1 expression, and neutrophil- to-lymphocyte ratio ( NLR). Results: We identified 79 patients with locally advanced NSCLC who were not surgical candidates. Patients treated with durvalumab (n=44) had significantly improved survival compared to the historical cohort (n= 35) including a median PFS of 17.4 months versus 8.0 months (p=0.0019) and a median OS of 37.0 months versus 17.0 months (log-rank p-value=0.07, Wilcoxon p-value=0.02). Within the durvalumab group, outcomes did not significantly differ between those who initiated therapy before or after 42 days of finishing between various PD-L1 expression levels, or between high or low NLR. Conclusion: Patients who received durvalumab as consolidation therapy following definitive CRT demonstrated significantly improved survival compared to a historical cohort who did not receive durvalumab. Furthermore, durvalumab appears to benefit patients regardless of time to initiation, PD-L1 expression, or NLR.

TI  - Efficacy and Safety of Programmed Death 1/Programmed Death-Ligand 1 Plus Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte-Associated Antigen 4 Inhibitors for Advanced or Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Meta-analysis Based on Randomized Controlled Trials
T2  - THERAPEUTIC DRUG MONITORING
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: This meta-analysis aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of programmed death 1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) combined with cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) inhibitors for patients with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods: Authors conducted a comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Scopus, and Medline for randomized controlled trials comparing the prognosis and safety of PD-1/PD-L1 plus CTLA-4 inhibitors with other therapies for advanced or metastatic NSCLC. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used as effect sizes. The primary outcomes of this study were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival. Results: A total of 4943 patients diagnosed with stage III/IV advanced or metastatic NSCLC were included in the analysis of the 6 randomized controlled trials. The results showed that patients receiving dual immunotherapy with PD-1/PD-L1 plus CTLA-4 inhibitors had a longer survival time compared with the control group (HR = 0.88, P = 0.044). However, no statistically significant difference was observed in progression-free survival (HR = 0.95, P = 0.579). Subgroup analysis revealed better OS in the interventional group for patients aged >65 years (HR = 0.88, P = 0.076), smokers (HR = 0.81, P = 0.036), and those with a tumor mutational burden (TMB) >= 20 mut/Mb (HR = 0.66, P < 0.001). Conversely, the control group demonstrated superior OS in patients with TMB <20 mut/Mb (HR = 1.14, P = 0.048). In addition, the statistical results indicated a lower incidence rate of any-grade anemia in the dual immunotherapy group compared with the control group (RR = 0.32, P = 0.04). Conclusions: This meta-analysis demonstrates the effectiveness and safety of dual immunotherapy with PD-1/PD-L1 plus CTLA-4 inhibitors for treating advanced or metastatic NSCLC. Its efficacy is influenced by certain clinical and pathological factors, such as age, smoking status, and TMB.

TI  - Safety and efficacy of durvalumab after concurrent chemoradiation in Black patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer
T2  - CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe PACIFIC trial established consolidative durvalumab after concurrent chemoradiation as standard-of-care in patients with stage III or unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Black patients, however, comprised just 2% (n = 14) of randomized patients in this trial, warranting real-world evaluation of the PACIFIC regimen in these patients. MethodsThis single-institution, multi-site study included 105 patients with unresectable stage II/III NSCLC treated with concurrent chemoradiation followed by durvalumab between 2017 and 2021. Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and grade & GE;3 pneumonitis-free survival (PNFS) were compared between Black and non-Black patients using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses. ResultsA total of 105 patients with a median follow-up of 22.8 months (interquartile range, 11.3-37.3 months) were identified for analysis, including 57 Black (54.3%) and 48 (45.7%) non-Black patients. The mean radiation prescription dose was higher among Black patients (61.5 & PLUSMN; 2.9 Gy vs. 60.5 & PLUSMN; 1.9 Gy; p = .031), but other treatment characteristics were balanced between groups. The median OS (not-reached vs. 39.7 months; p = .379) and PFS (31.6 months vs. 19.3 months; p = .332) were not statistically different between groups. Eight (14.0%) Black patients discontinued durvalumab due to toxicity compared to 13 (27.1%) non-Black patients (p = .096). The grade & GE;3 pneumonitis rate was similar between Black and non-Black patients (12.3% vs. 12.5%; p = .973), and there was no significant difference in time to grade & GE;3 PNFS (p = .904). Three (5.3%) Black patients and one (2.1%) non-Black patient developed grade 5 pneumonitis. ConclusionsThe efficacy and tolerability of consolidative durvalumab after chemoradiation appears to be comparable between Black and non-Black patients.

TI  - STereotactic Ablative RadioTherapy in NEWly Diagnosed and Recurrent Locally Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients Unfit for ConcurrEnt RAdio-Chemotherapy: Early Analysis of the START-NEW-ERA Non-Randomised Phase II Trial
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION ONCOLOGY BIOLOGY PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: This is a single arm phase 2 trial (Clinical trials.gov NCT05291780) to assess local control (LC) and safety of SAbR in patients with unresectable locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC) unfit for concurrent chemo-radiation therapy (ChT-RT).Methods: Neoadjuvant ChT was prescribed in fit patients. The tumor volume included primary tumor and any regionally pos-itive node/s. The coprimary study endpoints were LC and safety.Results: Between December 31, 2015, and December 31, 2020, 50 patients with LA-NSCLC were enrolled. Histology was squa-mous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma (ADC) in 52% and 48%, respectively. Forty (80%) patients had ultracentral tumor. Twenty-seven (54%) received neoadjuvant ChT and 7 (14%) adjuvant durvalumab. Median prescribed dose was 45 Gy (range, 35-55) and 40 Gy (35-45) in 5 daily fractions to tumor and node/s, respectively. After a median follow-up of 38 months (range, 12-80), 19 (38%) patients had experienced local recurrence (LR) at a median time of 13 months (range, 7-34). The median LR-free survival (FS) was not reached (95% confidence interval [CI], 28 to not reached). The 1-, 2-, and 3-year LR-FS rates were 86% +/- 5%, 66% +/- 7%, and 56% +/- 8%, respectively. At last follow-up, 33 (66%) patients were alive. Median overall survival (OS) was 55 months (95% CI, 43-55 months). The 1-, 2-, and 3-year OS rates were 94% +/- 3%, 79% +/- 6%, and 72% +/- 7%, respectively. No patients developed >= grade (G) 3 toxicity. ADC (hazard ratio [HR], 3.61; 95% CI, 1.15-11.35) was a significant predictor of better LC, while OS was significantly conditioned by smaller planning target volumes (HR, 1.004; 95% CI, 1.001-1.010) and tumor, node, and metastasis stage (HR, 4.8; 95% CI, 1.34-17). Conclustions: Patients with LA-NSCLC treated with SABR had optimal LC and promising OS in absence of >= G3 toxicity. Our early outcomes would suggest the feasibility of using this approach in patients with LA-NSCLC unfit for concurrent ChT-RT. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - A pilot trial of consolidation bevacizumab after hypo-fractionated concurrent chemoradiotherapy in patients with unresectable locally advanced non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer
T2  - CANCER MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: To determine the feasibility of incorporating bevacizumab consolidation into hypo-fractionated concurrent chemoradiotherapy (hypo-CCRT) for patients with unresectable locally advanced non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer (LA-NS-NSCLC).Patients and Methods: Eligible patients were treated with hypo-RT (40Gy in 10 fractions) followed by hypo-boost (24-28Gy in 6-7 fractions), along with concurrent weekly chemotherapy. Patients who completed the hypo-CCRT without experiencing =G2 toxicities received consolidation bevacizumab every 3 weeks for up to 1 year, until disease progression or unacceptable treatment-related toxicities.The primary endpoint was the risk of G4 or higher hemorrhage. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), locoregional failure-free survival (LRFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), and objective response rate (ORR). All time-to-event endpoints (OS, PFS, LRFS, and DMFS) were measured from the start of radiotherapy.Results: Between December 2017 and July 2020, a total of 27 patients were included in the analysis, with a median follow-up duration of 28.0 months. One patient (3.7%) developed G5 hemorrhage during bevacizumab consolidation. Additionally, seven patients (25.9%) had G3 cough and three patients (11.1%) experienced G3 pneumonitis. The ORR for the entire cohort was 92.6%. The median OS was 37.0 months (95% confidence interval, 8.9-65.1 months), the median PFS was 16.0 months (95% confidence interval, 14.0-18.0 months), the median LRFS was not reached, and the median DMFS was 18.0 months.Conclusions: This pilot study met its goal of demonstrating the tolerability of consolidation bevacizumab after hypo-CCRT. Further investigation of antiangiogenic and immunotherapy combinations in LA-NSCLC is warranted, while the potential for grade 3 respiratory toxicities should be taken into consideration.

TI  - Two Complementarity Immunotherapeutics in Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer Patients-Mechanism of Action and Future Concepts
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Simple SummaryHere, we focused on the most important mechanisms of action of combined immunotherapy with modern anticancer approaches in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. This knowledge is extremely important for lung cancer clinicians. First, it facilitates proper involvement of the patient in the treatment and monitoring its effectiveness. More importantly, the knowledge of the immunotherapy mechanisms will certainly allow quick recognition of the side effects of such a therapy, which are totally different of those observed after chemotherapy. Side effects of combination therapies can occur at any stage of treatment, and even after completion thereof. This review article could particularly explain the mechanism of action of combined immunotherapy, which have different targets in patients.Due to the limited effectiveness of immunotherapy used as first-line monotherapy in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the concepts of combining classical immunotherapy based on immune checkpoint antibodies with other treatment methods have been developed. Pembrolizumab and atezolizumab were registered in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of metastatic NSCLC, while durvalumab found its application in consolidation therapy after successful chemoradiotherapy in patients with locally advanced NSCLC. Exceptionally attractive, due to their relatively low toxicity and high effectiveness, are treatment approaches in which a combination of two different immunotherapy methods is applied. This method is based on observations from clinical trials in which nivolumab and ipilimumab were used as first-line therapy for advanced NSCLC. It turned out that the dual blockade of immune checkpoints activated T lymphocytes in different compartments of the immune response, at the same time affecting the downregulation of immune suppressor cells (regulatory T cells). These experiments not only resulted in the registration of combination therapy with nivolumab and ipilimumab, but also initiated other clinical trials using immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in combination with other ICIs or activators of costimulatory molecules found on immune cells. There are also studies in which ICIs are associated with molecules that modify the tumour environment. This paper describes the mechanism of the synergistic effect of a combination of different immunotherapy methods in NSCLC patients.

TI  - Treatment-related pulmonary adverse events induced by chemoradiation and Durvalumab affect survival in locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer
T2  - RADIOTHERAPY AND ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: We compared treatment-related pulmonary adverse events (TRPAE), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) among locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who received concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) versus CRT followed by immune check point inhibitor (ICI) immunotherapy (CRTI).Materials and methods: TRPAE was defined as any pulmonary events as defined in CTCAE v.5 occurring within 12 months after completion of radiotherapy. Outcomes were compared between CRT and CTRI by Cox proportional hazard regression and Kaplan-Meier analyses. We also assessed if TRPAE-induced discontinuation of ICI affected survival.Results: We analyzed 326 patients treated between July 2010 and November 2019; 195 patients received CRT and 131 received CRTI. The incidences of severe grade >= 3 TRPAE were similar between the two groups, however, symptomatic TRPAE was almost doubled in CRTI group (65.7 % CTRI vs 35.9 % CRT, P < 0.0001). The rates of 4-year OS and PFS were 54.5 % vs 36.7 % (P = 0.0003) and 43.8 % vs 35.8 % (P = 0.038) in CRT + Durvalumab and CRT group, respectively. Receipt of ICI Durvalumab was associated with better 4-year OS (HR 0.53, 95 % CI 0.36-0.78, P = 0.001) and PFS (HR 0.55, 95 % CI 0.38-0.80, P = 0.002). Patients who discontinued ICI because of TRPAE had worse 4-year OS (P = 0.001) and higher rates of distant metastasis (P = 0.003) than those who completed planned ICI after developing TRPAE.Conclusion: CRT followed by adjuvant ICI led to improved 4-year OS and PFS consistent with published data. CRTI was associated with higher incidence of grade >= 2 TRPAE in both high and low mean lung dose groups without significant difference in grade >= 3 TRPAE. Discontinuation of ICI due to TRPAE was asso-ciated with poorer OS and distant disease control than completing ICI as planned after developing TRPAE.(c) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Evaluating Pneumonitis Incidence in Patients with Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Treated with Immunotherapy and/or Chemotherapy Using Real-world and Clinical Trial Data
T2  - CANCER RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Pneumonitis is a potentially life-threatening complication of anticancer therapy, and future treatment decisions may be informed by characterizing patients receiving therapies in the real-world setting. In this study, the inci-dence of treatment-associated pneumonitis (TAP) was compared among patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) or chemotherapies in either of two settings: randomized clinical trials (RCT) or real world data (RWD)-based clinical practice. Pneumonitis cases were identified using International Classifica-tion of Diseases codes (for RWD), or the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities preferred terms (for RCTs). TAP was defined as pneumonitis diagnosed during treatment or within 30 days of the last treatment ad-ministration. Overall TAP rates in the RWD cohort were lower [ICI: 1.9%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.2-3.2; chemotherapy: 0.8%; 95% CI, 0.4- 1.6] than overall rates in the RCT cohort (ICI: 5.6%; 95% CI, 5.0-6.2; chemotherapy: 1.2%; 95% CI, 0.9-1.5). Overall RWD TAP rates were similar to grade 3+ RCT TAP rates (ICI: 2.0%; 95% CI, 1.6-2.3; chemotherapy: 0.6%; 95% CI, 0.4-0.9). In both cohorts, higher TAP incidence was ob-served among patients with a past medical history of pneumonitis than those without, regardless of treatment group. On the basis of this sizable study leveraging RWD, TAP incidence was low in the RWD cohort, likely in part due to methodology used for RWD focusing on clinically significant cases. Past medical history of pneumonitis was associated with TAP in both cohorts.Significance: Pneumonitis is a potentially life-threatening complication of anticancer treatment. As treatment options expand, management decisions become increasingly complex, and there is a greater need to understand the safety profiles of the treatment options in the real-world setting. Real-world data serve as an additional source of valuable information to complement clinical trial data and inform understanding of toxicity in patients with non-small cell lung cancer receiving ICIs or chemotherapies.

TI  - Impact of radiation dose to the immune cells in unresectable or stage III non-small cell lung cancer in the durvalumab era
T2  - RADIOTHERAPY AND ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background/purpose: Higher estimated radiation doses to immune cells (EDIC) have correlated with worse overall survival (OS) in patients with locally-advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) prior to the PACIFIC trial, which established consolidative durvalumab as standard-of-care. Here, we examine the prognostic impact of EDIC in the durvalumab era.Materials/methods: This single-institution, multi-center study included patients with unresectable stage II/III NSCLC treated with chemoradiation followed by durvalumab. Associations between EDIC [analyzed continuously and categorically (<= 6 Gy vs > 6 Gy)] and OS, progression-free survival (PFS), and locore-gional control (LRC) were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional methods.Results: 100 patients were included with median follow-up of 23.7 months. The EDIC > 6 Gy group had a significantly greater percentage of stage IIIB/IIIC disease (76.0 % vs 32.6 %; p < 0.001) and larger tumor volumes (170 cc vs 42 cc; p < 0.001). There were no differences in early durvalumab discontinuation from toxicity (24.1 % vs 15.2 %; p = 0.27). Median OS was shorter among the EDIC > 6 Gy group (29.6 months vs not reached; p < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, EDIC > 6 Gy correlated with worse OS (HR: 4.15, 95 %CI: 1.52-11.33; p = 0.006), PFS (HR: 3.79; 95 %CI: 1.80-8.0; p < 0.001), and LRC (HR: 2.66, 95 %CI: 1.15-6.18; p = 0.023). Analyzed as a continuous variable, higher EDIC was associated with worse OS (HR: 1.34; 95 % CI: 1.16-1.57; p < 0.001), PFS (HR: 1.52; 95 %CI: 1.29-1.79; p < 0.001), and LRC (HR: 1.34, 95 %CI: 1.13- 1.60; p = 0.007).Conclusions: In the immunotherapy era, EDIC is an independent predictor of OS and disease control in locally advanced NSCLC, warranting investigation into techniques to reduce dose to the immune compartment.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Immuno-Oncological Treatment and Tumor Mass in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: Case-Control Analysis of Overall Survival in Routine Clinical Practice
T2  - ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Immuno-oncological (IO) therapies such as PD-1 and PD-L1 antibodies have been introduced in the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) since 2015 based on randomized trials showing unprecedented advantages in overall survival (OS) with hazard ratios (HRs) between 0.5 and 0.7. The impact of these treatments on OS in routine clinical practice and the role of tumor mass have not been studied. Methods: 557 consecutive patients with inoperable stage III or stage IV NSCLC diagnosed in our certified lung cancer center from 2006 to 2018 were included if they had received at least one line of systemic treatment. OS of immuno-oncologically treated patients (IO patients, n = 144) who received treatment with a PD-1 antibody (nivolumab [n = 77] or pembrolizumab [n = 51]) or a PD-L1 antibody (atezolizumab [n = 4] or durvalumab [n = 12]) was compared to historic controls treated before availability of IO treatment (n = 413) using case-control analysis. IO patients and historic controls were individually matched for stage, performance state, histology, smoking status, gender, age, and initial treatment mode (palliative vs. definitive radio-chemotherapy). Results: Case-control analysis of 91 matched pairs showed significantly longer OS in IO patients compared to historic controls (21.2 vs. 10.9 months, HR 0.526, CI 0.373-0.723). The benefit was more pronounced in patients with lower tumor stage (HR 0.48 [stage III], 0.40 [IVA], 0.63 [IVB]) or smaller tumor size (HR 0.38 [RECIST <= 57 mm], 0.40 [RECIST 58-94 mm], 0.59 [RECIST 95-141 mm], 0.75 [RECIST >= 142 mm]). Conclusions: IO patients showed significant benefit in OS with HRs comparable to those reported in phase III trials. The benefit tended to be greater in patients with lower tumor mass. (C) 2019 S.

TI  - Anlotinib Hydrochloride and PD-1 Blockade as a Salvage Second-Line Treatment in Patients with Progress of Local Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer in Half a Year After Standard Treatment
T2  - ONCOTARGETS AND THERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: As for local advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), synchronous radiotherapy and chemotherapy is the standard treatment mode. But for patients with progress in half a year, which means the second-line chemotherapy effect is not ideal for them. We observed the efficacy and safety of anlotinib hydrochloride combined with PD-1 blockade as the second-line treatment for those patients in this trial.Patients and Methods: From January 2018 to December 2019, 57 patients with the progress of local advanced NSCLC treated with anlotinib plus PD-1 blockade until disease progression or intolerance as a result of adverse events. Patients have been assessed using computed tomography prior to treatment and during follow-up every 2 months until disease progression or death. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR). The secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and safety. Survival curves were created using the Kaplan-Meier method.Results: 57 patients were enrolled. The median age was 64 years, and 61.4% of the patients were men. The ORR was 50.9% with a median OS time of 14 months and the 1-year OS rates and PFS rates were 81.8% and 33.3%, respectively. The patients with squamous cell carcinoma, no brain or liver metastases had longer PFS than patients with liver metastasis. When the PFS was calculated from the time of second treatment, the median PFS was 9 months. Most adverse events (AEs) were grade 1-3, one drug -related death was noted.Conclusion: The expected outcome of this study is that anlotinib combined with PD-1 blockade has tolerable toxicity and better ORR, OS than second-line chemotherapy. The results may indicate additional treatment options for patients with progress of local advance NSCLC in half a year after standard treatment.

TI  - Hypofractionated Radiotherapy followed by Hypofractionated Boost with weekly concurrent chemotherapy for Unresectable Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: Results of A Prospective Phase II Study (GASTO-1049)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION ONCOLOGY BIOLOGY PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: We launched a prospective phase 2 clinical trial to explore the safety and efficacy of hypofractionated radiation therapy (hypo-RT) followed by hypofractionated boost (hypo-boost) combined with concurrent weekly chemotherapy in patients with unresectable locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC).Methods and Materials: Patients with newly diagnosed LA-NSCLC with unresectable stage III disease were recruited between June 2018 and June 2020. Patients were treated with hypo-RT (40 Gy in 10 fractions) followed by hypo-boost (24-28 Gy in 6-7 fractions) combined with concurrent weekly chemotherapy (docetaxel 25 mg/m(2) and nedaplatin 25 mg/m(2)). The primary endpoint of the study was progression-free survival (PFS), and the secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), locoregional failure-free survival (LRFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), objective response rate (ORR), and toxicities.Results: From June 2018 to June 2020, 75 patients were enrolled with a median follow-up duration of 28.0 months. The ORR of the whole cohort was 94.7%. Disease progression or death was recorded in 44 (58.7%) patients, with a median PFS of 21.6 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 15.6-27.6 months). The 1-and 2-year PFS rates were 81.3% (95% CI, 72.5%-90.1%) and 43.3% (95% CI, 31.5%-55.1%), respectively. The median OS, DMFS, and LRFS had not been reached at the time of the last follow-up. The 1-and 2-year OS rates were 94.7% (95% CI, 89.6%-99.8%) and 72.4% (95% CI, 62.0%-82.8%), respectively. The most frequent acute nonhematologic toxicity was radiation esophagitis. Grade (G) 2 and G3 acute radiation esophagitis were observed in 20 (26.7%) and 4 (5.3%) patients, respectively. Thirteen patients (13/75, 17.3%) had G2 pneumonitis and no G3-G5 acute pneumonitis occurred during follow-up.Conclusions: Hypo-RT followed by hypo-boost combined with concurrent weekly chemotherapy could yield satisfactory local control and survival outcomes with moderate radiation-induced toxicity in patients with LA-NSCLC. The new potent hypo-CCRT regimen significantly shortened treatment time and provided the potential opportunity for the combination of consolidative immunotherapy. (c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Real-world efficacy and safety of anlotinib as third- or further-line treatment in refractory small cell lung cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF CANCER RESEARCH AND CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose As a novel antiangiogenic multi-target tyrosine kinase inhibitor recently approved in China, anlotinib has exhibited promising anticancer efficacy and acceptable safety profile in the salvage treatment of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) in clinical trials. Here we retrospectively investigated the efficacy and safety of anlotinib as third- or further-line treatment in patients with refractory SCLC. Patients and methods A total of 40 patients with refractory SCLC treated with anlotinib monotherapy were included in this study. The clinicopathological data, treatment information, survival data and safety data were retrospectively collected. Survival curves were constructed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate analysis was performed by log-rank testing. Results Altogether, 40 patients of extensive-stage SCLC or progressive limited-stage SCLC received anlotinib monotherapy as third- or further-line treatment from July 2018 to June 2020. Four patients achieved partial response (PR), 14 patients achieved stable disease (SD), no complete response (CR) was recorded, and 22 patients experienced progressive disease (PD). The disease control rate (DCR) was 45.0%. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 3.0 months (95% CI 2.241-3.759), and the median overall survival (OS) was 7.8 months (95% CI 3.190-12.410). The common adverse effects (AEs) included hypertension, fatigue, anorexia, cough, rash and nausea. Grade 3 treatment-related AEs occurred in 3 (7.5%) patients. One patient interrupted anlotinib treatment due to repeated grade 1 epistaxis. Univariate analysis revealed that patients without liver metastases, previously treated with radiotherapy or with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scores of 0 or 1 had longer OS with anlotinib treatment. Cox regression analysis demonstrated that patients without liver metastases and patients with ECOG score <= 1 had longer PFS, while patients without liver metastases had longer OS. Conclusion Anlotinib is beneficial to refractory SCLC as third- or further-line treatment, especially in patients without liver metastasis and with better physical status. Related adverse effects are tolerable and manageable.

TI  - Adjuvant chemoradiotherapy plus pembrolizumab for locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma with high risk of recurrence following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy: a single-arm phase II study
T2  - CANCER IMMUNOLOGY IMMUNOTHERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundAdjuvant nivolumab reduces recurrence in patients with locoregional esophageal cancer who had pathological residual disease after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and R0 resection. However, the efficacy of adjuvant anti-PD-1 therapy in patients at higher risk of recurrence remains unclear.MethodsThis phase II trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03322267) enrolled patients with locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy plus esophagectomy but still had various risk factors for recurrence, such as involved or close margins (<= 1 mm), extranodal extension of the involved lymph nodes, and the ypN2-3 stage. Patients received adjuvant therapy composed of a course of cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy and pembrolizumab (200 mg, IV every 3 weeks) for 18 cycles. The primary endpoint was 1-year relapse-free survival (RFS) rate.ResultsTwenty-five patients were enrolled. The risk factors were tumor margins of <= 1 mm (18 patients), extranodal extension of the involved lymph nodes (9 patients), and the ypN2-3 stage (9 patients). The median follow-up duration was 21.6 months (95% CI: 18.7-33.2). The rate of 1-year RFS was 60.0%. The median duration of RFS and overall survival was 14.3 (95% CI: 9.0-19.5) and 21.6 (95% CI: 0.0-45.5) months, respectively. Treatment-emergent adverse events of any grade and those of >= 3 grade occurred in 56% and 8% of all patients receiving cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy and in 79.2% and 12.5% of those receiving pembrolizumab.ConclusionsAdjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by pembrolizumab is feasible and may be associated with improved 1-year RFS rate in patients at high risk of recurrence after trimodality therapy for locally advanced ESCC.Trial registration number ClinicalTrials.gov (No. NCT03322267).ConclusionsAdjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by pembrolizumab is feasible and may be associated with improved 1-year RFS rate in patients at high risk of recurrence after trimodality therapy for locally advanced ESCC.Trial registration number ClinicalTrials.gov (No. NCT03322267).

TI  - Monitoring the Response of PD-L1 Expression to Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors in Nonsmall-Cell Lung Cancer Xenografts by Immuno-PET Imaging
T2  - MOLECULAR PHARMACEUTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accumulating evidence has suggested that the tumor micro-environment of nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) may be impacted by chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). PD-L1 is an important biomarker in the tumor microenvironment that can predict patient response to immunotherapies. Therefore, it is highly desirable to achieve a real-time, noninvasive assessment of PD-L1 expression, which can provide critical information for recruiting patients as well as monitoring therapeutic efficacy. We herein studied the EGFR-TKI-induced effects on PD-L1 levels in NSCLC tumor models using immuno-PET imaging with Zr-89-Df-KN035, an imaging tracer previously established by our group. A549 human NSCLC xenografts were established in BALB/c nude mice and treated with different doses of an EGFR-TKI gefitinib. PET imaging with Zr-89-Df-KN035 was performed before and after the treatment to evaluate PD-L1 expression, which was further verified by immunohistochemical staining. Our results demonstrate that Zr-89-Df-KN035 can specifically evaluate PD-L1 levels in NSCLC tumor models. Compared to the untreated control, the high dose of gefitinib inhibited tumor growth and lowered the tumor uptake of Zr-89-Df-KN035. In comparison, the low dose of gefitinib did not affect tumor growth, although the extensive tumor necrosis also led to the lower uptake of Zr-89-Df-KN035. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that immuno-PET imaging with Zr-89-Df-KN035 is a promising tool to noninvasively monitor PD-L1 expression in NSCLC treated with EGFR-TKIs and can be used to optimize treatment plans for immunotherapy.

TI  - Integrating radium-223 therapy into the management of metastatic prostate cancer care: a plain language summary
T2  - FUTURE ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - What is this summary about?Few life-prolonging treatment options are available for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). This article provides an overview of the current systemic treatments available for mCRPC and reviews studies that investigate the optimal timing for the use of radium-223. The aim is to illustrate possible systemic treatment sequences to maximize benefit from radium-223 therapy.What is metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer & how is it treated?Prostate cancer is called mCRPC when it spreads to organs outside of the prostate (such as the lymph nodes, bones, liver, or lungs) and no longer responds to hormonal therapy. There are several treatment options available for mCRPC, such as abiraterone, enzalutamide, radium-223, docetaxel, cabazitaxel, olaparib, rucaparib, sipuleucel-T, and 177Lu-PSMA. It is important to understand the risks and benefits associated with each treatment and whether current use may have an impact on future treatment options, including eligibility in certain clinical trials. Maintaining bone health is also an important part of prostate cancer care.What is radium-223?Radium-223 is a radioactive molecule that releases strong radiation within a very small range around itself. It mainly travels to the bone where the prostate cancer has spread and kills the cancer cells in that area. Results from a clinical study named ALSYMPCA showed that men who received radium-223 lived longer in addition to having less bone pain. The most common side effects of radium-223 are nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Radium-223 minimally suppresses the bone marrow, which means that it slightly reduces the levels of red and white blood cells.

TI  - Age-Stratified Analysis of First-Line Chemoimmunotherapy for Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer: Real-World Evidence from a Multicenter Retrospective Study
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Chemoimmunotherapy improved overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) in two phase III trials, which set the age-stratified subgroup analyses at 65 years. Considering the super-aged society of Japan, treatment efficacy and safety in elderly patients >= 75 years with ES-SCLC should be validated through real-world Japanese evidence. Consecutive 225 Japanese patients with SCLC were evaluated, and 155 received chemoimmunotherapy (98 non-elderly and 57 elderly patients). The dose reduction at initiating the first cycle was significantly higher in the elderly (47.4%) than in the non-elderly (20.4%) patients (p = 0.03). The median PFS and OS in the non-elderly and the elderly were 5.1 and 14.1 months and 5.5 and 12.0 months, respectively, without significant differences. Multivariate analyses revealed that age, the baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, and dose reduction at initiating the first chemoimmunotherapy cycle were not correlated with PFS or OS. Chemoimmunotherapy improved overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) in two phase III trials. They set the age-stratified subgroup analyses at 65 years; however, over half of the patients with lung cancer were newly diagnosed at >= 75 years in Japan. Therefore, treatment efficacy and safety in elderly patients >= 75 years with ES-SCLC should be evaluated through real-world Japanese evidence. Consecutive Japanese patients with untreated ES-SCLC or limited-stage SCLC unfit for chemoradiotherapy between 5 August 2019 and 28 February 2022 were evaluated. Patients treated with chemoimmunotherapy were divided into the non-elderly (<75 years) and elderly (>= 75 years) groups, and efficacy, including PFS, OS, and post-progression survival (PPS) were evaluated. In total, 225 patients were treated with first-line therapy, and 155 received chemoimmunotherapy (98 non-elderly and 57 elderly patients). The median PFS and OS in non-elderly and elderly were 5.1 and 14.1 months and 5.5 and 12.0 months, respectively, without significant differences. Multivariate analyses revealed that age and dose reduction at the initiation of the first chemoimmunotherapy cycle were not correlated with PFS or OS. In addition, patients with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG-PS) = 0 who underwent second-line therapy had significantly longer PPS than those with ECOG-PS = 1 at second-line therapy initiation (p < 0.001). First-line chemoimmunotherapy had similar efficacy in elderly and non-elderly patients. Individual ECOG-PS maintenance during first-line chemoimmunotherapy is crucial for improving the PPS of patients proceeding to second-line therapy.

TI  - De-escalating adjuvant durvalumab treatment duration in stage III non-small cell lung cancer
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: One year of adjuvant durvalumab following concurrent chemoradiotherapy significantly improves progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the optimal length of adjuvant therapy has not been determined.Methods: We identified patients with stage III NSCLC treated with definitive chemoradiation and adjuvant durvalumab from November 2017 to April 2021 from the United States Veterans Affairs system. Predictors of early durvalumab discontinuation were evaluated with Cox proportional hazards regression. The effect of differing durations of durvalumab treatment (up to 6, 9, and 12 months) on PFS and OS were compared with a marginal structural model and time-dependent Cox modelling.Results: We included 1006 patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer who received concurrent chemoradiotherapy and at least one dose of adjuvant durvalumab. The median duration of durvalumab treatment was 7 months (interquartile range 2.8-11.5) and 31% completed the intended durvalumab course. The most common reasons for early discontinuation were tumour progression (22%), immune-related adverse events (15%), and non-immune-related toxicity (6.0%), Marginal structural models suggested similar PFS for 9 months versus 12 months of durvalumab treatment and inferior PFS for 6 months versus 12 months.Conclusions: A substantial proportion of patients undergoing adjuvant durvalumab discontinue therapy early due to toxicity, and shorter durvalumab treatment durations may provide similar disease control to 12 months of therapy. Prospective randomised controlled studies are needed to characterise the optimal durvalumab treatment duration in locally advanced NSCLC patients. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness analysis of durvalumab as a maintenance treatment for patients with locally advanced, unresectable, stage III nsclc in china
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveThe aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of durvalumab compared with Best supportive care (BSC) after chemoradiotherapy in patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer from healthcare system perspective in China.MethodsA dynamic state transition model was adopted to simulate life time, direct medical costs and QALYs. In the base case scenario, for patients with unresectable, stage III non-small cell lung cancer whose disease has not progressed after platinum-based chemoradiation therapy, the treatment group would use durvalumab whereas the control group would use BSC. Clinical data and health utility were derived from the patient-level data of Asian ethnicity in the PACIFIC trial. Cost of drug acquisition, follow-up, medical service, inspection, terminal care and adverse event treatment were considered in this model. The cost of durvalumab was calculated based on retail prices and Patient Assistance Program.ResultsIn the base case, the durvalumab group yielded an additional 2.60 LYs and 2.37QALYs (discounted), causing an additional cost of 0.459 million RMB and 0.109 million RMB without and with PAP, so the ICER was 193,898 RMB/QALY and 46,093.12 RMB/QALY respectively.ConclusionsThis study demonstrated that durvalumab can improve the survival of patients with unresectable, stage III non-small cell lung cancer whose disease has not progressed after platinum-based chemoradiation therapy and would be a cost-effective option compared with BSC at a willingness to pay (WTP) threshold of 212676 RMB (three times GDP per capita of China in 2019).

TI  - Association Between Lung Immune Prognostic Index and Durvalumab Consolidation Outcomes in Patients With Locally Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer
T2  - CLINICAL LUNG CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Chemotherapy and radiotherapy followed by immunotherapy is standard treatment in unresectable stage III non -small cell lung cancer. LIPI score may improve the prediction of outcomes with treatment. We performed a retrospective study with 330 patients assessing this. We found a correlation between LIPI score and survival, providing evidence of its role as prognostic and predictive tool in these patients. Introduction: The LIPI, based on pretreatment derived neutrophils/[leukocytes-neutrophils] ratio (dNLR) and LDH, is associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) outcomes in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We aimed to assess baseline LIPI correlation with durvalumab consolidation outcomes in the locally advanced setting. Material and Methods: Multicentre retrospective study (330 patients) with stage III unresectable NSCLC treated with durvalumab after chemo-radiotherapy between April 2015 and December 2020; 65 patients treated with chemo-radiotherapy only. Baseline LIPI characterized 3 groups: good (dNLR <3 + LDH 3/LDH > ULN) and poor (dNLR > 3 + LDH > ULN). Primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Results: In the durvalumab cohort, median age was 67 years, 95% smokers, 98% with a performance status of 0-1; 60% had nonsquamous histology and 16% a PD -L1 expression < 1%. Radiotherapy was delivered concurrently in 81%. LIPI was evaluable in 216 patients: 66% good, 31% intermediate, 3% poor. LIPI significantly correlated with median OS (median followup: 19 months): 18.1 months vs. 47.0 months vs. not reached in poor, intermediate and good LIPI groups, respectively ( P = .03). A trend between objective response rate and LIPI groups was observed: 0% vs. 41% vs. 45%, respectively ( P = .05). The pooled intermediate/poor LIPI group was associated with shorter OS (HR 1.97; P = .03) and higher risk of progressive disease (OR 2.68; P = .047). Survivals and response were not influenced in the control cohort. Conclusion: Baseline LIPI correlated with outcomes in patients with locally advanced NSCLC treated with durvalumab consolidation, but not in those who only received chemo-radiotherapy, providing further evidence of its prognostic and potential predictive role of ICI benefit in NSCLC.

TI  - Phase II study of neoadjuvant checkpoint blockade in patients with surgically resectable undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma and dedifferentiated liposarcoma
T2  - BMC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Soft tissue sarcomas are a heterogeneous and rare group of solid tumors of mesenchymal origin that can arise anywhere in the body. Although surgical resection is the mainstay of treatment for patients with localized disease, disease recurrence is common and 5-year overall survival is poor (similar to 65%). Both radiation therapy and conventional chemotherapy are used to reduce local and distant recurrence. However, the utility of radiation therapy is often limited by disease location (in the case of retroperitoneal sarcomas, for instance) while systemic therapy with conventional lines of chemotherapy offer limited efficacy and are often poorly tolerated and associated with significant toxicity. Within the past decade, major advances have been made in the treatment of other malignancies including melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, and non-small cell lung carcinoma with the advent of immune-checkpoint inhibitors such as ipilimumab (anti-CTLA4), pembrolizumab (anti-PD1), and nivolumab (anti-PD1). The recently published SARC028 (NCT02301039), an open label, phase II, multicenter trial of pembrolizumab in patients with advanced bone and soft tissue sarcomas reported promising activity in select histologic subtypes of advanced STS, including undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma and dedifferentiated liposarcoma.Methods: There is a clear need for novel and effective adjuncts in the treatment of STS. We hypothesize that immune checkpoint blockade will be effective in patients with surgically resectable primary or locally recurrent dedifferentiated liposarcoma and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma when administered in the neoadjuvant setting. The primary aim of this phase II, single-center, open label, randomized non-comparative trial is to determine the pathologic response to neoadjuvant nivolumab monotherapy and combination nivolumab/ipilimumab in patients with resectable dedifferentiated liposarcoma of the retroperitoneum or undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma of the trunk or extremity treated with concurrent standard of care neoadjuvant radiation therapy.Discussion: This study will help define the role of single agent anti-PD1 and combination anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD1 therapy in patients with surgically resectable dedifferentiated liposarcoma and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma.

TI  - Treatment Characteristics and Real-World Progression-Free Survival in Patients With Unresectable Stage III NSCLC Who Received Durvalumab After Chemoradiotherapy: Findings From the PACIFIC-R Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF THORACIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The phase 3 PACIFIC trial established consoli-dation therapy with durvalumab as standard of care for patients with unresectable, stage III NSCLC and no disease progression after definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT). The observational PACIFIC-R study assesses the real-world effectiveness of dur-valumab in patients from an early access program. Here, we report treatment characteristics and a preplanned analysis of real-world progression-free survival (rwPFS).Methods: PACIFIC-R (NCT03798535) is an ongoing, inter-national, retrospective study of patients who started dur-valumab (intravenously; 10 mg/kg every 2 wk) within an early access program between September 2017 and December 2018. The primary end points are investigator -assessed rwPFS and overall survival (analyzed by Kaplan- Meier method).Results: As of November 30, 2020, the full analysis set comprised 1399 patients from 11 countries (median follow-up duration, 23.5 mo). Patients received durvalumab for a median of 11.0 months. Median rwPFS was 21.7 months (95% confidence interval: 19.1-24.5). RwPFS was numeri-cally longer among patients who received concurrent versus sequential CRT (median, 23.7 versus 19.3 mo) and among patients with programmed cell death-ligand 1 expression greater than or equal to 1% versus less than 1% (22.4 versus 15.6 mo). Overall, 16.5% of the patients had adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation; 9.5% of all patients discontinued because of pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease.Conclusions: Consolidation durvalumab after definitive CRT was well tolerated and effective in this large, real -world cohort study of patients with unresectable, stage III NSCLC. As expected, rwPFS was longer among patients who received concurrent versus sequential CRT and patients with higher programmed cell death-ligand 1 expression. Nevertheless, favorable rwPFS outcomes were observed regardless of these factors.(c) 2022 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - The next generation of immunotherapy: keeping lung cancer in check
T2  - JOURNAL OF HEMATOLOGY & ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Lung cancer is the deadliest malignancy with more cancer deaths per year than the next three cancers combined. Despite remarkable advances in targeted therapy, advanced lung cancer patients have not experienced a significant improvement in mortality. Lung cancer has been shown to be immunogenic and responsive to checkpoint blockade therapy. Checkpoint signals such as CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1 dampen T cell activation and allow tumors to escape the adaptive immune response. Response rates in patients with pretreated, advanced NSCLC were much higher and more durable with PD-1 blockade therapy compared to standard-of-care, cytotoxic chemotherapy. Therefore, PD-1 inhibitors such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab were rapidly approved for both squamous and nonsquamous lung cancer in the pretreated population. The advent of these new therapies have revolutionized the treatment of lung cancer; however, the majority of NSCLC patients still do not respond to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition leaving an unmet need for a large and growing population.Immunotherapy combinations with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or novel immunomodulatory agents are currently being examined with the hope of achieving higher response rates and improving overall survival rate. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy has been theorized to increase the release of tumor antigen leading to increased responses with immunotherapy. However, cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation therapy may also destroy actively proliferating T cells. The correct combination and order of therapy is under investigation. The majority of patients who do respond to immunotherapy have a durable response attributed to the effect of adaptive immune system's memory. Unfortunately, some patients' tumors do progress afterward and investigation of checkpoint blockade resistance is still nascent.This review will summarize the latest efficacy and safety data for early and advanced NSCLC in both the treatment-naive and pretreated settings. The emerging role of immunotherapy for the treatment of small cell lung cancer and malignant mesothelioma will also be discussed.

TI  - Pembrolizumab: A Review in Advanced Melanoma
T2  - DRUGS
M3  - Review
AB  - Pembrolizumab (Keytruda (R)) is a humanized monoclonal antibody against programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1), a key immunoinhibitory checkpoint protein implicated in down-regulating anti-tumour immune responses. This intravenous drug is indicated for the treatment of advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma, on the basis of its clinical benefit in this setting in the phase I KEYNOTE 001 trial (expansion cohorts) and the phase II and III trials, KEYNOTE 002 and 006. These studies were conducted in ipilimumab-naive and/or ipilimumab-experienced patients and assessed varying pembrolizumab regimens administered every 2 or 3 weeks, all of which helped to determine the recommended dosage of 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks. In the trials with active comparator arms, pembrolizumab regimens significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and overall response rates (ORR) relative to ipilimumab in ipilimumab-naive patients (KEYNOTE 006), and significantly improved PFS and ORR, but not OS (although OS data are immature), relative to chemotherapy in ipilimumab-refractory patients, who had also received BRAF/MEK inhibitor therapy if BRAF-mutation positive (KEYNOTE 002). Pembrolizumab has an acceptable tolerability profile, with immune-related adverse events that are generally manageable/reversible. Thus, pembrolizumab is a valuable treatment option for patients with advanced melanoma, including those who have progressed on ipilimumab and BRAF/MEK inhibitors.

TI  - Real-world outcomes with durvalumab after chemoradiotherapy in patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC: interim analysis of overall survival from PACIFIC-R
T2  - ESMO OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Based on the findings of the PACIFIC trial, consolidation durvalumab following platinum-based chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is a global standard of care for patients with unresectable, stage III non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). An earlier analysis from the ongoing PACIFIC-R study (NCT03798535) demonstrated the effectiveness of this regimen in terms of progression-free survival (PFS). Here, we report the first planned overall survival (OS) analysis.Patients and methods: PACIFIC-R is an observational/non-interventional, retrospective study of patients with unresectable, stage III NSCLC who started durvalumab (10 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks) within an AstraZeneca-initiated early access program between September 2017 and December 2018. Primary endpoints are OS and investigator-assessed PFS, estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.Results: By 30 November 2021, the full analysis set included 1154 participants from 10 countries (median follow-up in censored patients: 38.7 months). Median OS was not reached, and the 3-year OS rate was 63.2% (95% confidence interval 60.3% to 65.9%). Three-year OS rates were numerically higher among patients with programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression on >= 1% versus <1% of tumor cells (TCs; 67.0% versus 54.4%) and patients who received concurrent CRT (cCRT) versus sequential CRT (sCRT) (64.8% versus 57.9%).Conclusions: PACIFIC-R data continue to provide evidence for the effectiveness of consolidation durvalumab after CRT in a large, diverse, real-world population. Better outcomes were observed among patients with PD-L1 TCs >= 1% and patients who received cCRT. Nevertheless, encouraging outcomes were still observed among patients with TCs <1% and patients who received sCRT, supporting use of consolidation durvalumab in a broad population of patients with unresectable, stage III NSCLC.

TI  - Immunotherapy and Immunotherapy Combinations in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Simple SummaryImmunotherapy has changed the treatment paradigm of numerous malignancies such as non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma. To date, there has been only modest demonstrable efficacy of immunotherapy for prostate cancer. This lack of efficacy is likely due to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. When we consider the fact that metastatic castrate-resistant state is the most lethal form of prostate cancer, there is an unmet need to increase the efficacy of immune therapies for this disease. The treatment paradigm has now shifted towards combinatorial regimens to enhance the anti-tumor immune response. These combinations with immunomodulatory agents in ongoing clinical trials include conventional agents such as chemotherapy and numerous novel agents. This review summarizes the clinical trials recruiting patients with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer utilizing immunotherapeutic approaches.Although most prostate cancers are localized, and the majority are curable, recurrences occur in approximately 35% of men. Among patients with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) recurrence and PSA doubling time (PSADT) less than 15 months after radical prostatectomy, prostate cancer accounted for approximately 90% of the deaths by 15 years after recurrence. An immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and impaired cellular immunity are likely largely responsible for the limited utility of checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs) in advanced prostate cancer compared with other tumor types. Thus, for immunologically "cold" malignancies such as prostate cancer, clinical trial development has pivoted towards novel approaches to enhance immune responses. Numerous clinical trials are currently evaluating combination immunomodulatory strategies incorporating vaccine-based therapies, checkpoint inhibitors, and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. Other trials evaluate the efficacy and safety of these immunomodulatory agents' combinations with standard approaches such as androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), taxane-based chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and targeted therapies such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) and poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. Here, we will review promising immunotherapies in development and ongoing trials for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). These novel trials will build on past experiences and promise to usher a new era to treat patients with mCRPC.

TI  - Consolidation treatment of durvalumab after chemoradiation in real-world patients with stage III unresectable non-small cell lung cancer
T2  - THORACIC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Treatment for stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) of unresectable disease mainly involves concurrent chemoradiation (CRT). Post-CRT consolidation treatment with durvalumab is a major therapeutic advance that provides survival benefit in this group of patients. However, the performance of this treatment strategy remains to be studied in a real-world setting.Methods A total of 31 patients who had disease control post-CRT were included in the durvalumab early access program (EAP) as an intent-to-treat cohort and retrospectively reviewed for post-CRT progression-free survival (PFS) and time to metastatic disease or death (TMDD). The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) at the initiation of durvalumab was analyzed in 29 patients.Results The median time from the completion of concurrent CRT to the initiation of durvalumb was 2.8 months. The objective response was 25.8% and the 12 month PFS and TMDD-free rate were 56.4% and 66.9%, respectively. The low NLR patients showed a significantly longer post-CRT PFS (not reach vs. 12.0 months [95% CI: 5.5-not estimable]; P = 0.040; the hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.23 [95% CI: 0.05-1.00]; P = 0.048) and the 12 month post-CRT PFS rate (82.5 vs. 42.6%). The post-CRT TMDD (not reach vs. 12.6 months, [95% CI: 10.8-not estimable]; P = 0.010; the hazard ratio for distant metastasis or death, 0.11 [95% CI: 0.01-0.88]; P = 0.037) and 12 month post-CRT TMDD-free rate (90.9 vs. 57.1%) were also significantly higher in the low NLR patients.Conclusions Durvalumab consolidation treatment in real-world patients showed substantial efficacy and the correlation with the NLR level warrants further investigation.

TI  - Plunging Into the PACIFIC: Outcomes of Patients With Unresectable KRAS-Mutated Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Following Definitive Chemoradiation and Durvalumab Consolidation
T2  - CLINICAL LUNG CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - We present one of the largest, real-world KRAS -mutated cohorts following chemoradiation and durvalumab consolidation (per the PACIFIC trial) in unresectable, locally-advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), comparing 42 KRAS -mt with 114 patients KRAS -wt patients. We found KRAS -mt patients are more likely to sustain progression prior to durvalumab initiation; however, in those who receive durvalumab consolidation, PFS and OS are similar to KRAS -wt. tially improved progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in the PACIFIC trial becoming the standard of care in locally-advanced, unresectable NSCLC. KRAS mutation may influence response to ICI. Methods: In this single-institution, retrospective analysis, we compared treatment outcomes for patients with unresectable KRAS mutated ( KRAS -mt) and wild-type ( KRAS -wt) NSCLC treated with CRT between October 2017 and December 2021. Kaplan- Meier analysis was conducted comparing median progression free survival and median overall survival from completion of radiotherapy in all KRAS -mt patients and KRAS-G12C- mutated patients. Outcomes were also compared with and without ICI consolidation. Results: Of 156 patients, 42 (26.9%) were KRAS -mt and 114 (73.1%) were KRAS wt. Baseline characteristics differed only in histology; KRAS -mt NSCLC more likely to be adenocarcinoma. KRAS -mt patients had worse PFS (median 6.3 vs. 10.7 months, P = .041) but similar OS (median 23.1 vs. 27.3 months, P = .237). KRAS -mt patients were more likely to not receive ICI due to rapid disease progression post-CRT (23.8% vs. 4.4%, P = .007). Among patients who received ICI (n = 114), KRAS -mt was not associated with inferior PFS (8.1 vs. 11.9 months, P = .355) or OS (30.5 vs. 31.7 months, P = .692). KRAS-G12C patients (n = 22) had similar PFS and OS to other KRAS -mt. Conclusion: In one of the largest post-CRT KRAS -mt cohort published, KRAS -mt was associated with inferior PFS, largely due to rapid progression prior to ICI consolidation, but did not affect OS. Among those who received ICI consolidation, outcomes were comparable regardless of KRAS -mt status.

TI  - Concurrent Chemoradiation Therapy With or Without Nimotuzumab in Locally Advanced Squamous Cell Lung Cancer: A Phase 2 Randomized Trial
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION ONCOLOGY BIOLOGY PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: The study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CCRT) combined with nimotuzumab in patients with unresectable stage III squamous cell lung cancer (SqCLC).Methods and Materials: A prospective, single-center, open-label, randomized phase 2 trial was performed in patients with unresectable stage III SqCLC. Patients were randomized to receive 65 Gy thoracic radiation over 5 weeks concurrent with docetaxel and cisplatin or the same CCRT regimen combined with 200 mg of nimotuzumab (NIMO-CCRT), administered weekly by intravenous infusion. The primary endpoint was overall survival. The secondary endpoints were progression-free survival, objective response rate, failure patterns, and treatment-related toxicity.Results: From August 2015 to June 2020, 126 patients with SqCLC were randomized. Four patients withdrew consent before the start of treatment, and 122 patients were included for analysis, including 57 in the NIMO-CCRT group and 65 in the CCRT group. The median OS was 24.9 months in the NIMO-CCRT group and 23.5 months in the CCRT group (P = .655). The median PFS was 12.1 months in the NIMO-CCRT group and 13.7 months in the CCRT group (P = .968). The NIMO-CCRT group had a significantly lower risk of brain metastasis, with adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio of 0.099 (95% confidence interval, 0.012-0.81; P = .031). The incidence of grade >= 3 pneumonitis (P = .894) and esophagitis (P = .974) was similar between the 2 arms. There was no grade 2 or higher skin toxicity in NIMO-CCRT group.Conclusions: The coincident application of nimotuzumab with CCRT was well tolerated for locally advanced SCCL. The NIMO-CCRT group had an OS and PFS similar to that in the CCRT group, but a lower risk of brain metastasis. Further investigations are warranted. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - First-in-class TREM-1 inhibitors in combination therapy for pancreatic cancer
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - Project Summary/AbstractCarcinoma of the pancreas, or pancreatic cancer (PC), is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deathin the United States. According to the American Cancer Society, 55,300 new cases are expected in 2016.Despite advances in therapy, the 5-year survival rate is less than 4%. Current treatments of PC includesurgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy but they all only slightly prolong survival orrelieve symptoms in patients with PC. Gemcitabine (GEM), first line therapy for advanced PC, is onlymodestly effective with a median survival of about 6 months in randomized clinical trials, The combinationof GEM with different anticancer agents does not show significant survival advantage as compared withGEM alone. These limitations in efficacy of available treatments highlight the need for new treatments. Pancreatic inflammation is known to increase the risk of PC. High macrophage infiltration into the tumormass correlates with the promotion of tumor growth and metastasis development. Triggering receptorexpressed on myeloid cells (TREM-1), an inflammation amplifier, plays a role in PC progression.Expression of TREM-1 on tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), is upregulated in patients with PC andcorrelates to disease severity. Recently, we demonstrated that a first-in-class TREM-1 inhibitory peptideGF9 in free form and bound to macrophage-targeted lipopeptide complexes that mimic human high densitylipoproteins (GF9-HDL) inhibits tumor growth in animal models of PC. We also showed that blockade ofTREM-1 inhibits release of cytokines and M-CSF in these animal models. The main hypothesis of this project is that a combination therapy that includes TREM-1 inhibitors andanticancer agents and targets cancer-related inflammation and tumor cells directly can synergisticallyimprove survival of PC patients. We also hypothesize that this effect will be especially pronounced in PCpatients with high intratumoral macrophage infiltration. Our preliminary studies strongly support thishypothesis. The long-term objective of the proposed project is to develop a novel combinatorial approachto efficiently target PC. The major goal of the Phase I study is to demonstrate that specific inactivation ofTREM-1 with first-in-class inhibitory peptides in combination with GEM or nanoparticle albumin (nab)-bound paclitaxel (nab-PTX), another promising agent that directly targets cancer cells and is widelyapproved for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer (BC), synergistically suppresses PC tumorprogression in animal model system and improves survival. Phase I specific aims are to: 1) evaluate effectsand mechanisms of GF9-GEM and GF9-nab-PTX combinations in vitro, and 2) test GF9-GEM and GF9-nab-PTX combinations in two xenograft mouse models of PC. Non-toxic peptide GF9, which employs novel,ligand-independent mechanisms of TREM-1 inhibition, is anticipated to have less severe side effects. Inorder to increase peptide solubility, bioavailability and targeting to TAMs, we will utilize SignaBlok'sproprietary HDL-based nanosystem for macrophage-targeted delivery of water insoluble and poorly watersoluble drugs. We will use in vitro macrophage uptake assay to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of aputative receptor-mediated process of targeted delivery of GF9 to macrophages. We will optimize GF9formulations based upon their stability, GF9 content, and macrophage uptake in vitro. We will use an invitro cytotoxicity assay and immunoblot analysis to test proliferation of BxPC-3 and AsPC-1 cells as well asexpression of phospho-stathmin and alpha-tubulin in the presence of GEM, nab-PTX or their combinationswith GF9 formulations. We will use BxPC-3 and AsPC-1 mouse xenograft models to test the ability of GF9-GEM and GF9-nab-PTX combinations to synergistically inhibit tumor progression and promote survival ascompared with GF9, GEM, and nab-PTX alone. Free GF9 and GF9-HDL will be tested. Comprehensivehistology and immunohistochemistry studies will be performed to analyze angiogenesis, intratumoralmacrophage infiltration, and potential non-specific toxicity for organ/tissues. It is anticipated that the proposed research will identify a novel anticancer combination approach thatwill set the stage for the development of new targeted combination therapies of PC, thereby leading to ahigher survival rate of the patients. If successful, the Phase I will be followed in the Phase II by toxicology,absorption/ disposition/ metabolism/ excretion (ADME), pharmacology and chemistry/ manufacturing/control (CMC) studies, filing an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the US Food and DrugAdministration (FDA) and subsequent evaluation in humans. Final product will be the stable TREM-1-targeted lipopeptide formulation that can be used in combination therapies of PC patients to prolong theirsurvival. Importantly, our recent data demonstrate that blockade of TREM-1 suppresses in vivo progressionof not only PC but also non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Thus, successful completion of Phase I willprovide the proof of concept of the hypothesis that might be applicable to a variety of inflammation-associated tumors such as NSCLC, BC, colon cancer, and others.

TI  - Real-world Efficacy and Safety of Nivolumab for Advanced Non-Small-cell Lung Cancer: A Retrospective Multicenter Analysis
T2  - CLINICAL LUNG CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - We evaluated the real-world efficacy and safety of nivolumab in 142 patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer in Japan and identified the clinical characteristics that influence the efficacy. Negative EGFR/ALK mutation status and previous radiotherapy were significantly associated statistically with the treatment response. These findings might aid in the efficient immunotherapeutic management of lung cancer.Background: Nivolumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor, is now a standard treatment for previously treated advanced non-small-cell lung cancer based on the results from phase III clinical trials. We evaluated the real-world efficacy and safety of nivolumab in a nonselected population and identified the clinical characteristics that influence efficacy. Materials and Methods: A total of 142 patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer who were administered nivolumab at Keio University and affiliated hospitals in Japan from January to July 2016 were enrolled. The treatment efficacy and adverse events were retrospectively reviewed, and the clinical characteristics associated with the nivolumab response were evaluated using univariate and stratified analyses and the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test. Results: The objective response rate was 17.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 12.0%-24.0%), the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 58 days (95% CI, 50-67 days), and the proportion of patients with adverse events of any grade was 45.0%. EGFR/ALK mutation status was inversely associated with the treatment response (P < .05), and the difference in PFS for the mutation-positive versus mutation-negative patients was statistically significant (49 vs. 63 days; hazard ratio, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.1-5.2; P = .029). Previous radiotherapy also had a positive association with the treatment response (P = .012). Conclusion: The objective response rate, PFS, and adverse event profiles were comparable to those observed in previous clinical trials. EGFR/ALK mutation-negative status and previous radiotherapy might be key clinical characteristics associated with a positive treatment response. Our findings could aid in the efficient immunotherapeutic management of lung cancer. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - High Dose Thoracic Re-Irradiation and Chemo-Immunotherapy for Centrally Recurrent NSCLC
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Simple Summary Since the early 1980s, there has been a trend towards escalating radiation doses in pulmonary tumor recurrences with the aim of improving survival. In this context, we performed a literature search in order to summarize the evidence of curative thoracic re-irradiation for centrally recurrent lung cancer. Tumor relapse in this specific situation poses a major problem because of the proximity to mediastinal organs. Of the initial 227 studies, 11 fulfilled the inclusion criteria for this analysis. The median overall survival (mOS) was 18.1 months (range 9.3-25.1), the median progression-free survival (mPFS) was nine months (range 4.5-16), and the median locoregional control (mLRC) was 12.1 months (range 6.5-20). The total re-irradiation dose correlated with both mLRC (p-value = 0.012) and mOS (p-value = 0.007). As large-scale prospective trials in the field are missing, this literature review is primarily based on retrospective data. In today's age of enhanced long-term survival rates after chemoradiotherapy followed by immune checkpoint inhibition, the current analysis provides valuable insights into radiation treatment options for patients with loco-regional lung cancer recurrence. Introduction: Thoracic re-irradiation for recurrent lung cancer dates back four decades, when the first small series on 29 patients receiving palliative doses was published. With 5-year overall survival rates of 57% in PDL-1 positive patients after primary chemo-radio-immunotherapy, the number of patients who experience loco-regional relapse will increase in the near future. In this context, centrally recurring lung tumors pose a major treatment challenge. Hence, the aim of the current review is to compile the available evidence on curatively intended thoracic re-irradiation for this special clinical situation. Methods: A systematic literature search according to the PRISMA guidelines was performed. A study was included when the following criteria were met: (1) 66% of the patients had NSCLC, (2) a total dose of 50 Gy in the second course and/or a biologically effective dose of at least 100 Gy in both treatment courses was administered, (3) re-irradiation was administered with modern radiation techniques, (4) 50% or more of the patients had a centrally located relapse, (5) the minimum cohort size was 30 patients. Results: Of the initial 227 studies, 11 were analyzed, 1 of which was prospective. Median overall survival (OS) was 18.1 months (range 9.3-25.1), median progression free survival (PFS) was nine months (range 4.5-16), and median loco-regional control (LRC) was 12.1 months (range 6.5-20). Treatment-related mortality rates ranged from 2% to 14%. The total dose at re-irradiation correlated with both LRC (p-value = 0.012) and OS (p-value = 0.007) with a close relation between these two clinical endpoints (p-value = 0.006). The occurrence of acute toxicity grade 1 to 4 depended on the PTV size at re-irradiation (p-value = 0.033). Conclusion: The evidence regarding curative re-irradiation for centrally recurrent NSCLC is primarily based on scarce retrospective data, which are characterized by a high degree of heterogeneity. The OS in this clinically challenging situation is expected to be around 1.5 years after re-treatment. Patients with a good performance score, younger age, small tumors, and a longer interval to recurrence potentially benefit most from re-irradiation. In this context, prospective trials are warranted to achieve substantial advances in the field.

TI  - Predicting factors of symptomatic radiation pneumonitis induced by durvalumab following concurrent chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer
T2  - RADIATION ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) followed by durvalumab is the standard of care for unresectable locally-advanced non-small cell carcinoma (LA-NSCLC). However, a major concern about administration of durvalumab after CCRT is whether the incidence of symptomatic radiation pneumonitis (RP) may increase or not. In the present analysis, we report the initial results of CCRT followed by durvalumab in patients with LA-NSCLC in a real-world setting with focus on predicting factors for symptomatic RP. Methods Patients who were pathologically diagnosed as NSCLC and initiated treatment with CCRT followed by durvalumab between July 2018 to December 2019 were eligible for this study. Patients were included if they completed the planned CRT course and administered at least one course of durvalumab. We retrospectively investigated the preliminary survival outcome and incidence and predicting factors for symptomatic RP. Results Of the 67 patients who planned CCRT, 63 patients completed the entire CCRT course. Of these, 56 patients proceeded to consolidation with durvalumab. The median time to eternal discontinuation of durvalumab was 9.7 months. The cumulative proportion of the patients who exhibited symptomatic RP was 30, 40 and 44% at 3, 6 and 12 months, respectively. In multivariate analyses, pulmonary fibrosis score and lung V40 were significant predictive factors for symptomatic RP (p < 0.001, HR: 7.83, 95% CI: 3.38-18.13, and p = 0.034, HR: 3.17, 95% CI: 1.09-9.19, respectively). Conclusions Pulmonary fibrosis sore and lung V40 were significant predictive factors for symptomatic RP. We should be cautious about the administration of durvalumab for patients having subclinical pulmonary fibrosis. To our best knowledge, this is one of the first report showing the predictive value of high dose volumes to the lung in patients with LA-NSCLC who received CCRT followed by durvalumab.

TI  - Design and Development of Targeted-Liposome for drug delivery to lung cancer by exploiting a vulnerability induced by radiotherapy
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - AbstractThe proposed drug development will result in the design and development of a ligand-targetedliposome (LTL) that will aid in the targeted delivery of therapeutics to patients with Non-Small CellLung Cancer (NSCLC). We propose an innovative active targeting strategy and our technologyexploits the stress response that occurs within the cancer cells following exposure to ionizingradiation. This liposome targets the neoantigen Glucose-Regulated Protein 78 (GRP78) which isoverexpressed in NSCLC and is further induced when cancer cells are exposed to radiation, astandard of care for patients with NSCLSC. For patients with NSCLC, the 5-year overall survivalrate is 15%. The difficulty in treatment is partly due to genetic tumor heterogeneity, patientheterogeneity, induced immunosuppression, and limited drug penetration. The impact of currentcytotoxic chemotherapies on NSCLC is limited by lack of specificity hence the attendantcytotoxicity to normal cells, resistance to therapy and disease recurrence. We identified GRP78through the use of bacteriophage displayed peptide libraries and subsequent affinity purificationof surface proteins from cancer. The proposed research will advance our lead LTL’s towards INDenabling studies. We will design and optimize a new peptidomimetic based on modeling of ourparent peptide to achieve stronger specificity and prolonged circulation. We will synthesize thepeptidomimetics and generate the LTL and characterize the same. Furthermore, we willdemonstrate cancer specificity and sensitivity of the LTL’s using in vitro and in vivo assays. Atthe end of the project term, we will have determined and validated the feasibility of ournew LTL as an effective payload carrier and hence a therapeutic agent in NSCLC. In linewith our long-term goal in the next phase of the project, we study the bio-distribution anddrug loading capability and efficacy by conducting studies that will determine thetherapeutic effects of peptide-conjugated cancer pharmaceuticals.

TI  - Efficacy and Safety of PD-1 Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in Locally Advanced and Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer Patients with Chronic Infection
T2  - ONCOLOGY RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Immune checkpoint inhibitors have become new research hot spots in the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but the efficacy and safety of immunotherapy for patients with chronic infection are still unclear because existing clinical trials often exclude those patients. Materials and Methods: We identified 78 locally advanced or advanced NSCLC patients with chronic infection treated with programmed death-1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors alone or combined with the chemotherapy/bevacizumab therapy, of whom 60 with hepatitis B, 2 with hepatitis C, and 16 with syphilis. Objective response rates were assessed using the RECIST v1.1. Adverse events (AEs) were graded following the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v5.0. Results: Objective responses were observed in 19 out of 78 (24.36%) patients, and the disease control rate was 69.23% (54/78). No patient achieved a complete response. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 6.49 months (95% CI: 3.71-9.27). PFS was 1.44 months (95% CI: 0.00-4.34) for monotherapy versus 7.34 months (95% CI: 4.50-10.18) for combination therapy (p = 0.053). Patients in the first-line treatment group revealed relatively higher ORR and longer PFS (ORR: 48.00% vs. 13.20%, p = 0.001; PFS: 7.67 vs. 5.57 months, p = 0.129). Patients with combined radiotherapy showed longer PFS than those without combined radiotherapy (14.07 vs. 4.62, p = 0.027). The incidence of AEs of any grade was 73.07% (57/78), among which there were 7 cases of grade 4 AEs. The incidence of leukopenia in any grade of AEs was the highest (57.69%), followed by anemia (25.64%), elevated alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase (24.36%), and fatigue (21.79%). Hepatic transaminase increased in 26.7% (16/60) of HBV-infected patients and remained unchanged in 65.0% (39/60) patients. Conclusions: The PD-1 inhibitor showed an acceptable toxicity profile and moderate efficacy on NSCLC patients with chronic infection, but still has the potential to increase the incidence of hepatitis.

TI  - Clinical and radiological features of immune checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonitis in lung cancer and non-lung cancers
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To investigate the clinical and radiological features of immune checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonitis (ICI-P), a rare but serious pulmonary complication of cancer immunotherapy and to evaluate key differences between lung cancer (LC) and non-LC patients.Methods: 247 patients (LC, n = 151) treated with ICI for malignancies were retrospectively screened in a single institute. The number of patients, history of other immune-related adverse events (irAE), the onset, serum KL-6 levels, and chest CT features (types of pneumonitis, symmetry, laterality, location) were recorded for the ICI-P population and compared for LC and non-LC groups.Results: ICI-P was identified in 26 patients in total (LC, n = 19; non-LC, n = 7). The incidence of other irAE was significantly higher in ICI-P group (63%) compared with patients without ICI-P (34%) (p = 0.0056). An earlier onset of ICI-P was recorded in LC (78 days) compared to non-LC patients (186 days) (p = 0.0034). Serum KL-6 was significantly elevated only in the non-LC group when ICI-P was noticed (p = 0.029). Major CT findings of ICI-P, irrespective of primary disease, were organizing pneumonia pattern and ground glass opacities. LC patients commonly exhibited consolidation and traction bronchiectasis and were prone to asymmetrical shadows (p < 0.001). Non-LC patients were more likely to exhibit symmetrical infiltrations. A small fraction of both groups experienced relapse or moving patterns of ICI-P.Conclusion: ICI-P patients more often experienced other irAE prior to the development of ICI-P. The characteristics of ICI-P can differ in terms of the onset, KL-6 reliability, and chest CT findings between LC and non-LC patients.Advances in knowledge: In ICI-P patients, a history of other irAE can be more frequently observed. Differences in disease onset and radiological patterns between LC and non-LC patients might be helpful to make a diagnosis of ICI-P; however, longitudinal observation of chest CT scans is advised to observe the pneumonitis activity irrespective of cancer types.

TI  - Molecular and Clinical Premises for the Combination Therapy Consisting of Radiochemotherapy and Immunotherapy in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Simple SummaryImmunotherapy is one of the most effective systemic treatment methods for many types of cancers. Unfortunately, cancer cells developed a number of defense mechanisms e.g., the absence of NK cells, macrophages or T lymphocytes in the tumor stroma, lack of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the tumor microenvironment (IL-6, IL-2, IL-12, TNF-alpha), production of immunosuppressive compounds (TGF-beta, indoleamine dioxygenase or neutralization of immune cells through direct immune checkpoints interactions (CD80/CD86 with CTLA-4 and PD-L1 with PD-1) that eventually make treatment ineffective. In this way, non-immunogenic, "cold" tumors are formed. The paper presents those mechanisms in details and focuses on the radiochemotherapy technique which, by neoantigen production, abscopal effect and activation of interferon synthesis pathways (STING), affects the production of cytokines and chemokines and transforms "cold" tumors into highly immunogenic "hot", inflammatory tumors, susceptible to immunotherapy. Results are based on clinical trials conducted to date, which showed high effectiveness of the combination therapy consisting of radiochemotherapy and immunotherapy in NSCLC patients.Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of the most common malignancies around the world. Due to the advanced stage of the disease at the time of diagnosis, most patients require systemic treatment. Immunotherapy with immune checkpoints inhibitors is becoming the main treatment method for many cancers, including NSCLC. Numerous studies have shown greater efficacy of immunotherapy used monoclonal antibodies anti-PD-1 (pembrolizumab and nivolumab) or anti-PD-L1 (atezolizumab and durvalumab) compared to chemotherapy. Unfortunately, cancer cells can develop a number of mechanisms to escape from immune surveillance, including avoidance of cancer cells by the immune system (immune desert), production of immunosuppressive compounds (prostaglandins, IDO, TGF-beta), or direct immune checkpoints interactions. Therapy based on the use of radiochemotherapy with subsequent immunotherapy is becoming the main focus of research in the field of new NSCLC therapies. Radiation therapy stimulates the immune response multidirectionally, affects production of neoantigens and proinflammatory compounds, which transform non-immunogenic ("cold") tumors into highly immunogenic ("hot") tumors. As a result, the mechanisms of escape of cancer cells from immune surveillance break down and the effectiveness of immunotherapy increases significantly. The results of clinical trials in this area bring new hope and indicate greater effectiveness of such treatment in terms of prolongation of progression-free survival and overall survival.

TI  - Nivolumab safety and efficacy in advanced, platinum-resistant, non-small cell lung cancer, radical radiotherapy-ineligible patients: A phase II study in Taiwan
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE FORMOSAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Background/Purpose: There is a lack of data on nivolumab treatment outcomes in Taiwanese patients with advanced or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) ineligible for radical radiotherapy and resistant to platinum-based chemotherapy. We investigated the safety and efficacy of nivolumab in this population.Methods: In this ongoing, multicenter, open-label, single-arm, phase II study, patients aged >= 20 years with a performance status of 0-1 and stage IIIB/IV or recurrent NSCLC received nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks in 6-week cycles. Interim data obtained between 27 January 2016 and 21 May 2017 were analyzed. Safety, based on adverse event (AE) reporting, was the primary endpoint. Efficacy assessment parameters included overall response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), and progression-free survival (PFS).Results: Among 53 treated patients with advanced NSCLC (median age 61.0 years; 62.3% male), mean treatment duration was 99.7 days. AEs (any grade) and serious AEs were reported by 92.5% and 47.2% of patients, respectively. Adverse drug reactions (ADRs; any) occurred in 58.5% of patients; grade >= 3 ADRs occurred in 13.2% of patients. Five deaths occurred; two cases (neoplasm progression and septic shock) were considered treatment-emergent. Common ADRs were fatigue (17.0%) and rash (13.2%). Common immune-related treatment-emergent AEs were rash (17.0%) and pruritus (13.2%). The centrally assessed ORR was 9.4% (5/53). The median OS and median PFS were 11.5 months and 1.4 months, respectively.Conclusion: Nivolumab appeared to be safe and effective in Taiwanese patients. These interim results suggest that nivolumab is a suitable treatment option for this population. Copyright (C) 2020, Formosan Medical Association. Published by Elsevier Taiwan LLC.

TI  - Impact of Patient Characteristics, Prior Therapy, and Sample Type on Tumor Cell Programmed Cell Death Ligand 1 Expression in Patients with Advanced NSCLC Screened for the ATLANTIC Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF THORACIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: We evaluated the impact of patient characteristics, sample types, and prior non-immunotherapy treatment on tumor cell (TC) programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression using samples from patients with advanced NSCLC.Methods: Patients (N = 1590) screened for the ATLANTIC study submitted a recently acquired (<= 3 months) or archival (> 3 months to > 3 years old) tumor sample for PD-L1 assessment using the VENTANA PD-L1 (SP263) Assay with a cutoff of >25% of TCs expressing PD-L1 (TC >= 25%). Samples were acquired either before or after the two or more treatment regimens required for study entry and sample age varied among patients. A subset of patients (n = 123) provided both recent and archival samples.Results: A total of 517 of 1590 (32.5%) patients had TC greater than or equal to 25%: prevalence was greater in smokers versus nonsmokers (p = 0.0005) and those with EGFR- versus EGFR+ tumors (p = 0.0002); these effects were independent. Prevalence of TC greater than or equal to 25% was increased in recent metastatic versus primary (p = 0.005) and recent versus archival (p = 0.039) samples. Chemotherapy or radiotherapy, but not tyrosine kinase inhibition, before sampling was associated with significantly increased PD-L1 prevalence. PD-L1 status (TC >= 25% cutoff) remained unchanged in 74.0% of patients with recent and archival samples; where PD-L1 status changed, it was more likely to increase than decrease over time or with inter-vening treatment.Conclusions: Several factors potentially impact PD-L1 TC greater than or equal to 25% prevalence in advanced NSCLC; however, no characteristic can be considered a surrogate for PD-L1 expression. Fresh biopsy may provide more accurate assessment of current tumoral PD-L1 expression where a low/negative result is seen in an archival sample, especially if the patient has received intervening therapy.

TI  - Pembrolizumab as a monotherapy or in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy in advanced non-small cell lung cancer with PD-L1 tumor proportion score (TPS) ≥50%: real-world data
T2  - ONCOIMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Both pembrolizumab (P) and combination of pembrolizumab with platinum-based chemotherapy (PCT) represent standard 1(st)-line options for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (aNSCLC) with PD-L1 tumor proportion score (TPS) >= 50%. The two strategies have never been compared in a randomized trial. 256 consecutive patients with EGFR/ALK/ROS1-wild-type PD-L1 TPS >= 50% aNSCLC receiving P (group P, n = 203) or PCT (group PCT, n = 53) as a 1(st)-line treatment were identified in the electronic databases of 4 Israeli cancer centers. Time-to-treatment discontinuation (TTD) and overall survival (OS) were assessed. Baseline characteristics were well balanced, except for age and ECOG PS differences in favor of group PCT. Median (m)TTD was 4.9 months (mo) (95% CI, 3.1-7.6) vs 8.0mo (95% CI, 4.7-15.6) (p-0.09), mOS was 12.5mo (95% CI, 9.8-16.4) vs 20.4mo (95% CI, 10.8-NR) (p-0.08), with P and PCT, respectively. In the propensity score matching analysis (n = 106; 53 patients in each group matched for age, sex and ECOG PS), mTTD was 7.9mo (95% CI, 2.8-12.7) vs 8.0mo (95% CI, 4.7-15.6) (p-0.41), and mOS was 13.3mo (95% CI, 6.8-20.3) vs 20.4mo (95% CI, 10.8-NR) (p-0.18), with P and PCT, respectively. Among various subgroups of patients examined, only in females (n = 86) mOS differed significantly between treatments (10.2mo (95% CI, 6.8-17.2) with P vs NR (95% CI, 11.4-NR) with PCT; p-0.02). In the real-world setting, no statistically significant differences in long-term outcomes with P vs PCT were observed; a prospective randomized trial addressing the comparative efficacy of P and PCT in different patient subgroups is highly anticipated.

TI  - First-line pembrolizumab in advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients with poor performance status
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Pembrolizumab is the first-line standard of care for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with a PD-L1 tumour proportion score (TPS) >= 50%. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (PS) 2 patients may receive pembrolizumab, despite the absence of sustaining evidence.Patients and methods: GOIRC-2018-01 is a multicentre, retrospective, observational study. PS 2 NSCLC patients with a PD-L1 TPS >= 50% receiving first-line pembrolizumab from June 2017 to December 2018 at 21 Italian institutions were included. Clinical-pathological characteristics were correlated with disease response and survival outcomes; adverse events were recorded. The primary objective was 6-months progression-free rate (6-months PFR).Results: One hundred fifty-three patients (median age 70 years) were enrolled. At a median follow-up of 18.2 months, median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 2.4 (95% confidence interval, 95% CI, 1.6-2.5) and 3.0 months (95% CI 2.4-3.5), respectively. 6-months PFR was 27% (95% CI 21-35%). Patients with a PS 2 determined by comorbidities (n = 41) had significantly better outcomes compared with disease burden-induced PS 2 (n = 112). Indeed, 6-months PFR was 49% versus 19%, median PFS 5.6 versus 1.8 months and OS 11.8 versus 2.8 months, respectively. Additional potential prognostic factors (radiotherapy, antibiotics, steroids received before pembrolizumab) correlated with clinical outcomes. The determinant of PS 2 resulted the only factor independently impacting on both PFS and OS. No toxicity issues emerged.Conclusions: Outcomes of PS 2 NSCLC patients with PD-L1 TPS >= 50% receiving first-line pembrolizumab were globally dismal but strongly dependent on the reason conditioning the poor PS itself.

TI  - Anti-PD-(L)1 immunotherapy for brain metastases in non-small cell lung cancer: Mechanisms, advances, and challenges
T2  - CANCER LETTERS
M3  - Review
AB  - The brain is one of the most common metastatic sites in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which is associated with an extremely poor prognosis. Despite the availability of several therapeutic options, the treatment efficacy remains unsatisfactory for NSCLC brain metastases. Anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1) monoclonal antibodies have reshaped therapeutic strategies in advanced NSCLC. Preliminary evidence has shown that anti-PD-(L)1 monotherapy is also effective in NSCLC patients with brain metastases. However, the traditional view asserted that these therapeutic antibodies were incapable of crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB) with large molecular size, thus most patients with brain metastases were excluded from most studies on anti-PD-(L)1 immunotherapy. Therefore, the efficacy and its mechanisms of action of anti-PD-(L)1 immunotherapy against brain metastases in NSCLC have not been clarified. In this review, we will survey the underlying mechanisms and current clinical advances of anti-PD-(L)1 immunotherapy in the treatment of brain metastases in NSCLC. The trafficking of activated cytotoxic T cells that are mainly derived from the primary tumor and deep cervical lymph nodes is critical for the intracranial response to anti-PD-(L)1 immunotherapy, which is driven by interferon--gamma (IFN-gamma). Additionally, promising combined strategies with the rationale in the treatment of brain metastases will be presented to provide future directions for clinical study design. Several significant challenges in the preclinical and clinical studies of brain metastases, as well as potential solutions, will also be discussed.

TI  - Targeted Natural Killer Cell-Based Adoptive Immunotherapy for the Treatment of Patients with NSCLC after Radiochemotherapy: A Randomized Phase II Clinical Trial
T2  - CLINICAL CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a fatal disease with poor prognosis. Amembrane-bound form of Hsp70 (mHsp70) which is selectively expressed on high-risk tumors serves as a target for mHsp70-targeting natural killer (NK) cells. Patients with advanced mHsp70-positive NSCLC may therefore benefit from a therapeutic intervention involving mHsp70-targeting NK cells. The randomized phase II clinical trial (EudraCT2008-002130-30) explores tolerability and efficacy of ex vivo-activated NK cells in patients with NSCLC after radiochemotherapy (RCT).Patients and Methods: Patients with unresectable, mHsp70-positive NSCLC (stage IIIa/b) received 4 cycles of autologous NK cells activated ex vivo with TKD/IL2 [interventional arm (INT)] after RCT (60-70 Gy, platinum-based chemotherapy) or RCT alone [control arm (CTRL)]. The primary objective was progression-free survival (PFS), and secondary objectives were the assessment of quality of life (QoL, QLQ-LC13), toxicity, and immunobiological responses.Results: The NK-cell therapy after RCT was well tolerated, and no differences in QoL parameters between the two study arms were detected. Estimated 1-year probabilities for PFS were 67% [95% confidence interval (CI), 19%-90%] for the INT arm and 33% (95% CI, 5%-68%) for the CTRL arm (P = 0.36, 1-sided logrank test). Clinical responses in the INT group were associated with an increase in the prevalence of activated NK cells in their peripheral blood.Conclusions: Ex vivo TKD/IL2-activated, autologous NK cells are well tolerated and deliver positive clinical responses in patients with advanced NSCLC after RCT.

TI  - Adding Base-Excision Repair Inhibitor TRC102 to Standard Pemetrexed-Platinum-Radiation in Patients with Advanced Nonsquamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: Results of a Phase I Trial
T2  - CLINICAL CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: TRC102, a small-molecule base-excision repair inhib-itor, potentiates the cytotoxicity of pemetrexed and reverses resis-tance by binding to chemotherapy-induced abasic sites in DNA. We conducted a phase I clinical trial combining pemetrexed and TRC102 with cisplatin-radiation in stage III nonsquamous non- small cell lung cancer (NS-NSCLC).Patients and Methods: Fifteen patients were enrolled from 2015 to 2019. The primary objective was to determine the dose-limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of TRC102 in combination with pemetrexed, cisplatin, and radiotherapy. Secondary objectives were to assess toxicity, tumor response, and progression-free survival at 6 months. Based on our preclinical experiments, pemetrexed- TRC102 was given on day 1, and cisplatin/radiotherapy was initiated on day 3. This schedule was duplicated in the second cycle. After completion, two additional cycles of pemetrexed-cisplatin were given. Toxicities were assessed using NCI CTACAE versions 4/5.Results: The median age was 69 years (45-79) with the median follow-up of 25.7 months (range, 7.9-47.4). No dose-limiting toxicities and no grade 5 toxicity were seen. Hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicities were the most common side effects. No clinical radiation pneumonitis was seen. Of 15 evaluable patients, three had complete response (20%), and 12 had partial response (80%). The 6-month progression-free survival was 80%, and the 2-year overall survival was 83%.Conclusions: Pemetrexed-TRC102 combined with cisplatin/ radiotherapy in NS-NSCLC is safe and well tolerated. The recommended phase II dose is 200 mg TRC102 along with cisplatin-pemetrexed. No additional safety signal was seen beyond the expected CRT risks. A phase II trial, integrating post-CRT immunotherapy with this aggressive DNA-damaging regimen, is warranted.

TI  - International Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Durvalumab in Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
T2  - JAMA NETWORK OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Importance Standard of care for unresectable locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) involves definitive chemoradiotherapy followed by maintenance therapy with durvalumab. However, the cost of durvalumab has been cited as a barrier to its use in various health systems. Objective To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of durvalumab vs placebo as maintenance therapy in patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC from 4 international payer perspectives (US, Brazil, Singapore, and Spain). Design, Setting, and Participants In this economic evaluation, a Markov model was designed to compare the lifetime cost-effectiveness of maintenance durvalumab for unresectable stage III NSCLC with that of placebo, using 5-year outcomes data from the PACIFIC randomized placebo-controlled trial. Individual patient data were extracted from the PACIFIC, KEYNOTE-189, ADAURA, ALEX, and REVEL randomized clinical trials to develop a decision-analytic model to determine the cost-effectiveness of durvalumab compared with placebo maintenance therapy over a 10-year time horizon. Direct costs, adverse events, and patient characteristics were based on country-specific payer perspectives and demographic characteristics. The study was conducted from June 1, 2022, through December 27, 2023. Main Outcomes and Measures Life-years, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), lifetime costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were estimated at country-specific willingness-to-pay thresholds ([data reported in US$] US: $150 000 per QALY; Brazil: $22 251 per QALY; Singapore: $55 288 per QALY, and Spain: $107 069 per QALY). One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to account for parameters of uncertainty. A cost-threshold analysis was also performed. Results The US base-case model found that treatment with durvalumab was associated with an increased cost of $114 394 and improved effectiveness of 0.50 QALYs compared with placebo, leading to an ICER of $228 788 per QALY. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, according to base-case models, were $141 146 for Brazil, $153 461 for Singapore, and $125 193 for Spain. Durvalumab price adjustments to the PACIFIC data improved cost-effectiveness in Singapore, with an ICER of $45 164. The model was most sensitive to the utility of durvalumab. Conclusions and Relevance In this cost-effectiveness analysis of durvalumab as maintenance therapy for unresectable stage III NSCLC, the therapy was found to be cost-prohibitive from the perspective of various international payers according to country-specific willingness-to-pay thresholds per QALY. The findings of the study suggest that discounted durvalumab acquisition costs, as possible in Singapore, might improve cost-effectiveness globally.

TI  - Real-world evidenceand clinical observations of the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - To summarize the therapeutic effects of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors on patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in a real-world setting, we attempted to identify potential molecular biomarkers or clinical factors that reflected the therapeutic effect. The medical records of patients with non-small cell lung cancer who were treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors were obtained from the outpatient department or inpatient department of Peking Union Medical College Hospital from August 1, 2015, to January 1, 2018. Our follow-up continued until May 1,2018. We chose overall survival (OS) as the primary observation endpoint and progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), and safety as the secondary observation endpoints. Efficacy was evaluated according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to generate survival curves, and we compared the influence of different factors on PFS and OS by the log-rank test. The median follow-up time was 11 months. At the end of the follow-up, 24 patients (61.5%) were still undergoing immunotherapy, and 7 patients (17.9%) had died. Twenty-six cases (66.7%) employed PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors as first-line treatment, and 7 cases (17.9%) employed PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors as second-line treatment. Only 6 cases (15.4%) employed PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors as third-line treatment. Therapeutic effect evaluation: Complete response (CR): 1 case (2.6%). Partial response (PR): 10 cases (25.6%). Stable disease (SD): 16 cases (41.0%). Progressive disease (PD): 12 cases (30.8%). The ORR was 28.2%, and DCR was 69.2%. The median PFS was 25.5 months (95% CI 6.8-44.1 months), which failed to reach the median OS. PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor treatment is more effective for advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients in a real-world setting than in clinical trials; PD-1/ PD-Ll inhibitor treatment is more effective for people who are over 70 than for people who are under 70. Additionally, patients who are over 75 years old have a higher response rate, suggesting that elderly patients may receive more benefits from immunotherapy; Patients who have an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation (+) may benefit from immunotherapy after treatment with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). It is essential to identify these potential patients from the entire patient pool; PD-1 may have a certain curative effect on brain metastases from NSCLC. Local radiotherapy may help to improve PD-1 intracranial efficacy.

TI  - Safety and efficacy of combination therapy using programmed cell death protein-1/programmed cell death ligand-1 inhibitors and radiotherapy in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - CANCER MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: A combination of programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) inhibitors and radiotherapy (RT) is increasingly being used to treat non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the safety and efficacy of this approach remains controversial. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize the related research.Methods: We searched the China Biology Medicine, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and PubMed databases for all the relevant studies. The Stata software, version 12.0 was used for the meta-analysis.Results: The study included 20 clinical trials that enrolled 2027 patients with NSCLC. Compared with non-combination therapy, combination therapy using PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors and RT was associated with prolonged overall survival (OS) (1-year OS: odds ratio [OR] 1.77, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.35-2.33, p = 0.000; 2-year OS: OR 1.77, 95% CI 1.35-2.33, p = 0.000) and progression-free survival (PFS) (0.5-year PFS: OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.13-2.98, p = 0.014; 1-year PFS: OR 2.09, 95% CI 1.29-3.38, p = 0.003; 2-year PFS: OR 2.47, 95% CI 1.13-5.37, p = 0.023). Combination therapy also improved the objective response rate (OR 2.76, 95% CI 1.06-7.19, p = 0.038) and disease control rate (OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.21-2.68, p = 0.004). This meta-analysis showed that compared with non-combination therapy, combination therapy using PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors and RT did not increase the serious adverse event rates (>= grade 3); however, this approach increased the rate of grade 1-2 immune-related or radiation pneumonitis. Subgroup analyses revealed that the sequence of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors followed RT outperformed in which concurrent PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor and RT followed PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor. Combination of stereotactic body RT or stereotactic radiosurgery with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors may be more effective than a combination of conventional RT with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in patients with advanced NSCLC.Conclusion: Combination therapy using PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors and RT may improve OS, PFS, and tumor response rates without an increase in serious adverse events in patients with advanced NSCLC. However, combination therapy was shown to increase the incidence of mild pneumonitis.

TI  - Improved Overall Survival and Locoregional Disease Control With Concurrent PD-1 Pathway Inhibitors and Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Lung Cancer Patients With Brain Metastases
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION ONCOLOGY BIOLOGY PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Despite the emerging role of programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) pathway inhibitors for patients with advanced lung cancer, a paucity of data are available on the activity of these agents among patients with brain metastases. We investigated the outcomes of PD-1 pathway inhibitors and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for the treatment of patients with brain metastases from lung cancer.Methods and Materials: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of non-small-cell lung cancer patients with brain metastases consecutively treated with PD-1 pathway inhibitors and SRS at our institution from 2012 to 2017. Overall survival (OS), distant brain failure (DBF), and local control (LC) were assessed using Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox regression models.Results: We identified 37 patients treated with SRS to 85 lesions (90.6% intact and 9.4% resected) and a median total of 7 doses of PD-1 pathway inhibitors (83.8% nivolumab, 10.8% atezolizumab, 5.4% pembrolizumab). Most lesions were treated with 18 Gy in a single fraction (n = 61; 71.8%). Patients treated with concurrent SRS and PD-1 pathway inhibitors had longer OS and reduced rates of DBF compared with patients treated with SRS before or after PD-1 pathway inhibitor therapy (1-year OS, 87.3% vs 70.0% vs 0%, P = .008; 1-year DBF, 38.5% vs 65.8% vs 100%, P = .042). LC was favorable among lesions treated with SRS concurrent with or after PD-1 pathway inhibitor therapy comparedwith before PD-1 pathway inhibitor therapy (1-year LC, 100% vs 72.3%, P = .016). Three lesions transiently enlarged after SRS and then had partially or completely resolved on follow-up imaging. Four patients required steroids for SRS-associated toxicity. No patient experienced grade >= 4 toxicity.Conclusions: Concurrent treatmentwith SRS and PD-1 pathway inhibitors was associated with favorable OS and locoregional disease control. This combination of therapy was well tolerated and merits further evaluation in larger cohorts in a prospective setting. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - A randomized, controlled phase III study of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and vincristine with etoposide (CAV-E) or teniposide (CAV-T), followed by recombinant interferon-alpha maintenance therapy or observation, in small cell lung carcinoma patients with complete responses
T2  - CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - BAGKGROUND. Studies of chemotherapy for patients with small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) have shown that teniposide (T) may have higher activity than etoposide (E). In this randomized, controlled Phase III study, the authors compared cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and vincristine (CAV) with E and CAV with T as induction treatments for patients with SCLC. A second objective of the study was to study patients who had achieved complete response (CR). They were considered for a second randomization to maintenance therapy, in which they would receive either recombinant interferon-alpha (rIFN-alpha) or no treatment.METHODS, From Tune 1990 to December 1995, 140 untreated SCLC patients were enrolled in this study. Patients were stratified by either limited disease (LD) or extensive disease (ED) and randomized to one of two treatment arms. The schedules for both arms included cyclophosphamide 1000 mg/m(2) administered intravenously (i.v.), doxorubicin 50 mg/m(2) i.v., and vincristine 2 mg i.v. on Day 1. Arm A (CAV-E) involved the addition of E 100 mg/m(2) i.v. on Days 2, 3, and 4; Arm B (CAV-T) involved the addition of T 60 mg/m(2) i.v. on Days 2, 3, and 4. Courses were repeated every 3 weeks. After 3 courses, patients with LD received chest radiotherapy and 2 additional consolidation courses, whereas patients with ED received 5 consecutive courses only. Patients with CR were considered for the second randomization, which consisted of either maintenance therapy with intramuscular (i.m.) rIFN-alpha-2b, 3 M.U., once a day for 9 months (IFN-alpha arm) or no therapy (control arm).RESULTS. At 5 years from start-up (3-year median observation time and 90% death rate), the study was closed. Results were as follows: 140 patients (71 in Arm A and 69 in Arm B) were eligible for survival analysis; 131 were evaluable for response and toxicity (66 in Arm A and 65 in Arm B), whereas 9 were not (6 early deaths and 3 with protocol violations). Among evaluable patients, 68 showed LD (35 assigned to Arm A and 33 to Arm B); the responses to treatment were 28.5% (10/35) CR and 51% (18/35) partial response (PR) to CAV-E, and 39% (13/33) CR and 39% PR (13/33) to CAV-T. Sixty-three patients showed ED (31 assigned to Arm A and 32 to Arm B); their responses were 22.5% (7/31) CR and 52% (16/31) PR to CAV-E, and 12.5% (4/32) CR and 50% (16/32) PR to CAV-T. Drug-related toxicity was WHO Grade 3-4 myelosuppression in 20% of 292 CAV-E courses and in 27% of 252 CAV-T courses. There were 6 toxic deaths, 1 in Arm A and 5 in Arm B (chi-square = 2.86); 2 patients in Arm A discontinued therapy due to persistent leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. No other remarkable toxicities were observed. Actuarial median survival (MS) was 13.7 months (range, 1.0-62.5 months) for patients with LD receiving CAV-E (Arm A) and 15.2 months (range, 0.5-68.2 months) for those receiving CAV-T (Arm B) (chi-square = 0.89); in patients with ED it was 10.5 months (range, 0.6-30.4 months) and 8.2 months (range, 0.2-24.8 months), respectively (chi-square = 3.42). Overall, MS was 12 months (range, 0.6-62.5 months) in Arm A and 10 months (range, 0.2-68.2 months) in Arm B (chi square = 0.059). Thirty-nine patients with CR (27.8%) were candidates for the second randomization. Among them, 26 patients (18.5%) complied with the program and were randomized as follows: 14 were assigned to the IFN-alpha arm and 12 Co the control arm. Starting from the second randomization, median time to progression was 12 months (range, 3-51 months) for patients in the IFN-alpha arm versus 7 months (range, 1-59 months) for patients in the control arm (chi-square = 0.12). MS was 15 months (range, 5-52.3 months) versus 9 months (range, 2-60.5 months) (chi-square = 0.13).CONCLUSIONS, This study did not show a wide difference inactivity and toxicity between CAV-E and CAV-T. The number of patients who entered the second randomization was too small to reach the second study endpoint. (C) 1997 American Cancer Society.

TI  - Association of Immune-Related Adverse Events and Efficacy Outcomes With Consolidation Pembrolizumab After Chemoradiation in Patients With Inoperable Stage III Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer
T2  - CLINICAL LUNG CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Many patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with immunotherapy experience immunerelated adverse events (irAEs). We evaluated the safety and efficacy of consolidation pembrolizumab after chemoradiotherapy in patients with stage III NSCLC. Patients who experienced irAEs did not have reduced in efficacy outcomes, and patients who discontinued therapy early because of irAEs and/or received immunosuppressive therapy for irAEs did not have reduced efficacy outcomes despite receiving fewer cycles of consolidation pembrolizumab. Background: Many patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with immunotherapy experience immunerelated adverse events (irAEs). Patients with metastatic NSCLC who receive checkpoint inhibitors (CPI) and experience irAEs generally receive fewer cycles of CPI without decreased efficacy. However, the association between irAEs and efficacy outcomes in patients with locally advanced NSCLC treated with curative intent with CPI after chemoradiation has never been reported. Here we report a retrospective analysis of the association between irAEs and efficacy outcomes from the Hoosier Cancer Research Network (HCRN) LUN 14-179 single-arm phase 2 trial of consolidation pembrolizumab after chemoradiation in patients with stage III NSCLC. Patients and Methods: A total of 92 eligible patients were enrolled from March 2015 to November 2016. Demographics, disease characteristics, and number of pembrolizumab cycles received were reported in patients with and without irAEs. Chi-square test was used for comparisons for categorical variables and Wilcoxon test for continuous variables. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to analyze time to metastatic disease or death (TMDD), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). A log-rank test was used to compare groups. Results: Any grade irAEs occurred in 55.4% of patients. There was no significant difference in number of pembrolizumab cycles received, TMDD, OS, or PFS in patients with and without irAEs. Patients who discontinued pembrolizumab early because of irAEs received significantly fewer cycles of pembrolizumab (5 vs 15, P 1/4 .0016) without a significant difference in TMDD, PFS, or OS. Similarly, patients who received immunosuppressive therapy received fewer numbers of cycles of pembrolizumab (4 vs 16, P < .001) without significantly reduced TMDD, PFS, or OS. Conclusion: irAEs due to pembrolizumab, regardless of grade or number of irAEs, were not associated with decreased efficacy outcomes. Furthermore, early discontinuation of pembrolizumab because of irAEs and/or treatment of irAEs with immunosuppressive therapy was not associated with a decrease in treatment efficacy.

TI  - Modern management of small-cell lung cancer
T2  - DRUGS
M3  - Review
AB  - In this article, we review best standard practice for the management of small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) and indicate the likely areas of development over the next 5-10 years. A number of prognostic scores have been developed and these allow more rational decisions on treatment.Treatment with cisplatin plus etoposide with early, concurrent radiotherapy is the standard of care for patients with limited-stage disease (LD) suitable for this approach. A 5-year survival rate of 25% has been reported for concurrent hyperfractionated radiotherapy; however, the applicability of this in most busy hospitals is uncertain and this treatment is currently being compared with a high-dose, once-daily regimen. Patients unsuitable for concurrent chemo-radiotherapy are treated with a sequential approach. Patients with LD responding to treatment should be offered prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI). A variety of strategies for improving survival have been investigated. Intensification of chemotherapy has not shown any clear survival advantage, but maintenance of dose intensity in patients with good prognosis is important. The evidence around maintenance therapy is conflicting and this is not routinely used.Patients with extensive-stage disease but few other adverse prognostic factors should be treated with a platinum compound plus etoposide, and carboplatin is a reasonable choice. Responding patients should be offered PCI as this is associated with a survival benefit. The initial positive results for irinotecan have not been repeated in a larger study. Age is not a prognostic factor, but caution needs to be exercised as prognostic scores do not reflect co-morbidity.Patients with relapsed disease have a poor prognosis, but there is evidence of a survival benefit for salvage chemotherapy in those fit for treatment. The choice of treatment will depend on a number of factors, including the disease-free interval. Topotecan is the only drug licensed in this indication, but myelosuppression is considerable.A number of new drugs are under evaluation and showing promise in SCLC. One of the most promising of these is amrubicin. A large randomised study has failed to show any benefit from the addition of thalidomide to chemotherapy with carboplatin and etoposide in extensive-stage disease patients responding to chemotherapy. Studies of a number of targeted treatments are also ongoing. The challenge for the future is to identify new targets, overcome drug-resistance mechanisms and redundancy in biological systems, and incorporate these new treatments into concurrent chemo-radiotherapy schedules.

TI  - Fostering efficacy of anti-PD-1-treatment: Nivolumab plus radiotherapy in advanced non-small cell lung cancer-study protocol of the FORCE trial
T2  - BMC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Hypofractionated palliative radiotherapy for metastatic lung cancer patients is frequently used in order to ease pain, to increase bone stability, to treat local mass effects, or to prolong progression-free survival at critical sites. Recently introduced, immunotherapy for patients with non-squamous non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) has significantly improved outcome in this cohort. Preclinical and early clinical data suggest that the combination of photon radiation with programmed death-1 (PD-1) targeting immunotherapies may promote a strong and durable immune response against tumor manifestations both within and beyond radiation targets. Methods/design In the present prospective, two-group, non-randomized, open-label phase II trial, 130 patients with stage IV non-squamous NSCLC in 2nd-line or 3rd-line treatment will be included. 65 patients with a clinical indication for palliative radiotherapy to non-cerebral/non-pulmonary metastatic sites will receive 240 mg nivolumab followed by palliative radiotherapy with 5 x 4 Gray (Gy) = 20 Gy photon radiation, which will be initiated within 72 h after first nivolumab administration (Group A). 65 patients without an indication for radiotherapy will only receive nivolumab (Group B). Nivolumab will be further administered every two weeks in both groups and will be continued until progression and loss of clinical benefit or until occurrence of limiting toxicities. The primary endpoint will be the objective response rate (ORR) according to response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) 1.1. Secondary endpoints will be progression-free survival (PFS) according to RECIST 1.1, overall survival, descriptive subgroup analyses according to PD-L1 expression, toxicity and quality of life. Since response patterns following immunotherapies differ from those after conventional cytostatic agents, both objective response rate and progression-free survival will additionally be assessed according to immune-related RECIST (irRECIST) criteria. Discussion The FORCE study will prospectively investigate response rates, progression-free and overall survival (OS), and toxicity of nivolumab with and without hypofractionated palliative radiotherapy in a group of 130 patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (non-squamous histology) in 2nd-line or 3rd-line treatment. This trial will contribute prospective data to the repeatedly published observation that the combination of hypofractionated photon radiotherapy and medical immunotherapy is not only safe but will also promote antitumoral immune responses.

TI  - A Pilot Study of Atezolizumab Plus Hypofractionated Image Guided Radiation Therapy for the Treatment of Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION ONCOLOGY BIOLOGY PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Preclinical data and subset analyses from immunotherapy clinical trials indi- cate that prior radiation therapy was associated with better progression-free survival and overall survival when combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. We present a prospective study of hypofractionated image guided radiation therapy (HIGRT) to a single site of metastatic disease concurrently with atezolizumab in patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.Methods and Materials: Patients meeting eligibility criteria received 1200 mg of atezolizumab intravenously every 3 weeks with concurrent 3- or 5-fraction HIGRT starting no later than the second cycle. The 3-fraction regimen employed a minimum of 8 Gy per fraction compared with 6 Gy for the 5-fraction regimen. Imaging was obtained every 12 weeks to assess response.Results: From October 2015 to February 2017, 12 patients were enrolled in the study (median age 64; range, 55-77 years). The best response by the Response Evaluation in Solid Tumors criteria was partial response in 3 and stable disease in 3, for a disease control rate of 50%. Five patients had a grade 3 immune-related adverse event, including choreoretinitis (n = 1), pneumonitis (n = 1), transaminitis (n = 1), fatigue (n = 1), and peripheral neuropathy (n = 1). The median progression-free survival was 2.3 months, and the median overall survival was 6.9 months (range, 0.4-not reached). There was no clear association between peripheral blood T cell repertoire characteristics at baseline, PD-L1, or tumor mutations and response or outcome. One long-term survivor exhibited oligoclonal T cell populations in a baseline tumor biopsy that were consistently detected in peripheral blood over the entire course of the study.Conclusions: HIGRT plus atezolizumab resulted in an overall response rate of 25% and disease control rate of 50% in this pilot study. The incidence of grade 3 adverse events was similar to that of atezolizumab alone. Alhough it was a pilot study with limited sample size, the results generated hypotheses worthy of further investigation. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Immune checkpoint blockade in the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer - predictors of response and impact of previous radiotherapy
T2  - ACTA ONCOLOGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe implementation of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) into the standard care of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has improved prognosis for this group of patients. However, long-term survival is rare. The aim of the study was to identify predictors of response and, especially, to investigate the impact radiotherapy might have on duration of response.Material and methodsThe association between pretreatment patient/tumor characteristics and progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and lung cancer-specific survival was investigated in 78 patients receiving an ICI as >= 2nd line treatment for advanced NSCLC, using Cox regression analysis. Due to competing risk, cause-specific deaths were also examined with cumulative incidence plots.ResultsMedian OS was 12.6 months (95% CI 7.8-18.2) and median PFS 4.1 months (95% CI 3.0-6.2), after median follow-up time of 49.7 months (range 20.9-51.5). Increasing CRP and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), were associated with poor PFS (CRP: HR 1.49, 95% CI 1.12-1.98; NLR: HR 1.59, 95% CI 1.22-1.85) and OS (CRP: HR 1.94, 95% CI 1.47-2.56; NLR: HR 1.54, 95% CI 1.27-1.87). Radiotherapy prior to immunotherapy was not significantly associated with patient outcome. However, when the dataset was split at 6 months of follow-up, to be able to identify early and late predictors of prognosis, we found that patients receiving radiotherapy <6 months prior to immunotherapy had better PFS (HR: 0.27, 95% CI 0.09-0.84) and lung cancer-specific survival (HR: 0.41, 95% CI 0.18-0.95) after the first 6 months of follow-up, while increasing CRP (PFS: HR1.61, 95% CI 1.21-2.14; OS: HR2.04, 95% CI 1.51-2.74) and NLR (PFS: HR 1.57, 95% CI 1.29-1.91; OS: HR 1.63, 95% CI 1.35-1.97) were predictors of poor short-term prognosis.ConclusionsRadiotherapy may be of importance to achieve a long-lasting response to immunotherapy, while indicators of systemic inflammation can help in identifying patients with poor short-term prognosis.

TI  - Relating Drugs to Genotypes to Transform Precision Cancer Therapeutics with Tuba-seq - a Novel, Highly Scalable and Quantitative Preclinical Experimental Oncology Platform
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - PROJECT SUMMARYD2G Oncology, Inc. proposes to develop a novel preclinical experimental platform that will effectively relatecancer drugs to genotypes (“D2G”) to predict pharmacogenomic interactions. D2G Oncology's innovativeapproach dramatically improves on established autochthonous mouse models of human cancer. These provenmodels allow controlled genomic alterations to initiate tumors in vivo in an appropriate immune-competentmicroenvironment and faithfully recapitulate progression of human cancer. D2G's innovative methods for thefirst time enable these animal models to become truly scalable and rigorously quantitative, and hence prac-tical to support drug discovery. D2G's approach can efficiently interrogate a large matrix of tumor genotypes topredict differential patient responses to therapies. Pharmaceutical companies are eager to obtain this infor-mation. D2G will significantly advance the state of the art in precision cancer therapy by helping pharma torationally select candidate compounds to advance and better match them to patients. D2G's oncology platformwill increase the success rate of clinical trials and lead to more effective personalized cancer treatments.The key innovation is a novel tumor barcoding and sequencing (Tuba-seq) pipeline. Every clonal tumor isuniquely barcoded, so the identity and number of cancer cells in each tumor can be readily quantified frombulk tumor-bearing tissues. Combined with lentiviral-mediated CRISPR/Cas9 somatic genome editing, tumorbarcoding allows many predefined tumor genotypes to be generated all at once in individual animals andtracked separately. Tuba-seq enables many tens of experiments (which would each ordinarily require separatecohorts of mice) to be multiplexed into a single mouse. Compared with conventional genetically engineeredmouse models, this approach enormously enhances scalability, introduces rigorous quantification, and reducessources of variation.The overall goal of the proposed Direct Phase 2 SBIR project is to transform the Tuba-seq pipeline into a robustplatform that can be marketed as a commercial service to pharmaceutical companies. Specific aims are to (1)expand the panel of tumor suppressor genes that the platform interrogates and carefully calibrate their effectsizes and (2) rigorously validate the ability of the platform to resolve small but clinically meaningful differencesin tumor suppressor gene-drug effect sizes with high statistical confidence, relying only on small cohorts of ani-mals.D2G will create the first practical and scalable preclinical experimental modeling approach that can assess howcandidate drugs interact with diverse, precisely-engineered cancer genotypes to predict differential patientresponses to therapy.

TI  - Radiomics predicts survival of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer undergoing PD-1 blockade using Nivolumab
T2  - ONCOLOGY LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Immune checkpoint blockade is an emerging anticancer strategy, and Nivolumab is a human mAb to PD-1 that is used in the treatment of a number of different malignancies, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), kidney cancer, urothelial carcinoma and melanoma. Although the use of Nivolumab prolongs survival in a number of patients, this treatment is hampered by high cost. Therefore, the identification of predictive markers of response to treatment in patients is required. In this context, PD-1/PDL1 blockade antitumor effects occur through the reactivation of a pre-existing immune response, and the efficacy of these effects is strictly associated with the presence of necrosis, hypoxia and inflammation at the tumour sites. It has been indicated that these events can be evaluated by specific assessments using a computed tomography (CT) texture analysis (TA) or radiomics. Therefore, a retrospective study was performed, which aimed to evaluate the potential use of this analysis in the identification of patients with NSCLC who may benefit from Nivolumab treatment. A retrospective analysis was performed of 59 patients with metastatic NSCLC who received Nivolumab treatment between January 2015 and July 2017 at Siena University Hospital (35 patients, training dataset), Catanzaro University Hospital and Reggio Calabria Grand Metropolitan Hospital, Italy (24 patients, validation dataset). Pre- and post-contrast CT sequences were used to contour the gross tumour volume (GTV) of the target lesions prior to Nivolumab treatment. The impact of variations on contouring was analysed using two delineations, which were performed on each patient, and the TA parameters were tested for reliability using the Intraclass Coefficient Correlation method (ICC). All analyses for the current study were performed using LifeX Software (c). Imaging, clinical and pathological parameters were correlated with progression free survival and overall survival (OS) using Kaplan Meier analysis. An external validation testing was performed for the TA Score using the validation dataset. A total of 59 patients were included in the analysis of the present study. The reliability ICC analysis of 14 TA parameters indicated a highly reproducibility (ICC >0.70, single measure) in 12 (85%) pre- contrast and 13 (93%) post-contrast exams. A specific cut-off was detected for each of the following parameters: volume (score 1 >36 ml), histogram entropy (score 1 > 1.30), compacity (score 1 <3), gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM)-entropy (score 1 >1.80), GLCM-Dissimilarity (score 1 >5) and GLCM-Correlation (score 1<0.54). The global texture score allowed the classification of two subgroups of Low (Score 0-1; 36 patients; 61%) and High Risk patients (Score >1; 23 patients; 39%) that respectively, showed a median OS of 26 (mean +/- SD: 18 +/- 1.98 months; 95% CI 14-21 months) and 5 months (mean +/- SD: 6 +/- 0.99 months; 95% CI: 4-8 months; P=0.002). The current study indicated that TA parameters can identify patients that will benefit from PD-1 blockage by defining the radiological settings that are potentially suggestive of an active immune response. These results require further confirmation in prospective trials.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of PARP inhibitor in non-small cell lung cancer: a systematic review with meta-analysis
T2  - CHINESE CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has undergone a major change in the last decade in terms of survival and prognosis due to the introduction of new drugs in the last 10 years. One of the drugs with the most promising preliminary results in NSCLC are PARP inhibitors (iPARPs), whose clinical trials have very heterogeneous results. The use of iPARPs in NSCLC may lead to increased survival in several selected patients, and their use may become a standard in the coming years. However, there is currently controversy about the efficacy and safety of these drugs in NSCLC. Therefore, future studies are needed to evaluate their role in these tumours. The aim of this review is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of iPARPs in the treatment of NSCLC. Methods: We performed a systematic review with meta-analysis using the different clinical trials (PubMed, COCHRANE, Science Direct, EMBASE and the clinical trial registry) that evaluated the efficacy and safety of iPARP in NSCLC by PRISMA criteria. The primary endpoint was to evaluate the efficacy of iPARPs in the treatment of NSCLC through overall and progression-free survival (OS and PFS). Two authors independently reviewed the articles and abstracts (A.O.H. and J.R.R.), with subsequent confirmation by a third independent reviewer (E.B.M.). The heterogeneity of the included studies in the meta-analysis was assessed by using the I2 statistic. Results: A total of 14 articles were included for analysis (2,651 patients). A total of 1,503 patients were randomised in iPARP arms and 1,148 patients were included in control arms. Three clinical trials were conducted in localised or locally advanced NSCLC and 11 in advanced or metastatic stages. The global OS of the meta-analysis showed a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.85 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.74-0.97] with a heterogeneity (I2) of 0% (P=0.84). PFS showed a HR of 0.93 (95% CI: 0.74-1.17) with an I2=51% (P=0.07). The overall adverse event rate (grade 1-5) was similar in both iPARP and placebo arms. Conclusions: iPARPs are a future promising in the treatment of NSCLC in terms of efficacy and safety. Proper patient selection [homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) positive] is key for future clinical trials. The studies conducted to date open a new approach for a novel treatment modality in NSCLC.

TI  - Prospective Single-Arm Phase 1 and 2 Study: Ipilimumab and Nivolumab With Thoracic Radiation Therapy After Platinum Chemotherapy in Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION ONCOLOGY BIOLOGY PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Consolidative thoracic radiation therapy (TRT) has been shown to improve outcomes for patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer. We hypothesized that the addition of ipilimumab (IPI) and nivolumab (NIVO) after TRT would improve outcomes for patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer.Methods and Materials: Eligibility required stable disease or better after platinum doublet chemotherapy. Study therapy included consolidative TRT to 30 Gy in 10 fractions, targeting residual primary tumor and initially involved regional lymph nodes. Two weeks after TRT, patients received concurrent IPI (3 mg/kg) and NIVO (1 mg/kg) every 3 weeks for 4 doses followed by NIVO monotherapy (480 mg) every 4 weeks until progression or up to 1 year.Results: The study enrolled 21 patients, with 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) of 24% (90% confidence interval [CI], 11%-40%) and a median PFS of 4.5 months (95% CI, 2.7%-4.6%). The 12-month overall survival (OS) was 48% (95% CI, 29%-64%) with a median OS of 11.7 months (95% CI, 4.7%-16.0%). Fifty-two percent of patients had >1 possibly related grade 3 to 4 immune-related adverse event. Grade 3 pulmonary and gastrointestinal immune-related adverse events were recorded in 19% and 24% of patients, respectively. Exploratory analysis showed increased cytotoxic T cell (CD3+CD8+) tumor infiltration was associated with favorable PFS (P = .01) and OS (P = .02). Reduction in peripheral blood CD3+CD8+ from baseline to after first dose of IPI/NIVO was associated with improved PFS (P = .02) and OS (P = .02).Conclusions: Consolidative IPI and NIVO after platinum-based chemotherapy and TRT demonstrated a toxicity profile consistent with the known adverse events attributable to IPI and NIVO. Although the study regimen did not significantly improve PFS, the OS was higher than historic expectations. CD3+CD8+ tumor infiltration and migration may identify patients most likely to have improved outcomes in small cell lung cancer. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Phase II study of multidisciplinary therapy combined with pembrolizumab for patients with synchronous oligometastatic non-small cell lung cancer TRAP OLIGO study (WJOG11118L)
T2  - BMC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Synchronous oligometastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is generally characterised by the limited number of metastases at the time of diagnosis. Several clinical trials have shown that local ablative therapy (LAT) at all sites of the disease might be beneficial for patients with oligometastatic NSCLC. In recent years, the combination of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) inhibitors or programmed cell death ligand 1 with cytotoxic chemotherapy has become a new standard treatment for patients with metastatic NSCLC. Furthermore, multisite LAT would inherently reduce the overall tumour burden, and this could promote T cell reinvigoration to enhance the efficacy of PD-1 inhibitors. Few studies have evaluated the efficacy of the combination of PD-1 inhibitors with LAT at all sites of disease. The aim of the present multicentre single-arm phase II study is to evaluate the efficacy of LAT at all sites of disease following standard platinum doublet chemotherapy with pembrolizumab in patients with oligometastatic NSCLC.Methods: Thirty patients with synchronous oligometastatic NSCLC will be enrolled in the trial. All patients will receive 2-4 cycles of a systemic treatment including pembrolizumab and chemotherapy as induction therapy. Patients who will receive LAT will be determined by a multidisciplinary tumour board, including medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, and thoracic surgeons. LAT will be administered at all sites of disease within 21-56 days of the last dose of induction therapy and will be followed by maintenance therapy within 42 days of the last day of LAT. The primary endpoint is the progression-free survival (PFS) rate of 24 months from the date of initiation of LAT. The secondary endpoints are toxicity, response to induction therapy, PFS, overall survival, and the frequency of LAT.Discussion: This study will provide novel data on the efficacy and safety profile of the combination of LAT and chemotherapy plus immune-checkpoint inhibitors in patients with synchronous oligometastatic NSCLC. If the primary endpoint of this study is met, extensive phase III studies further assessing this strategy will be recommended.

AB  - Project SummaryLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. Non-small cell lung cancer(NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer and despite aggressive treatment strategies that includemedical therapy, surgical resection, and radiation therapy, 5-year survival rates for patients with lung cancerremain dismal. Recently, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved several immune checkpointinhibitor-based therapies for the treatment of NSCLC, establishing immunotherapy as an effective therapeuticoption and standard-of-care treatment for NSCLC. Despite this, many patients fail to respond to immunecheckpoint blockade (ICB) and the subgroup of patients with KRAS and STK11 commutations (KL) hasemerged as a particularly aggressive, immunosuppressive form of NSCLC resistant to ICB. Our group hasrecently discovered that by treating KL-mutated NSCLC with epigenetic de-repressing agents, expression of akey protein in the immune response against lung cancer, stimulator of interferon genes (STING), is restored.When stimulus for the STING pathway is subsequently provided through pulsed inhibition of a spindleassembly checkpoint protein, monopolar spindle 1 (MPS1), potent anti-tumor responses occur, restoringsensitivity to ICB. While these findings have yet to be validated in clinical samples of KL-mutated NSCLC,these samples are now available to use for study. Validation of this therapeutic strategy will show that it ispossible to overcome KL-mutation induced immunosuppression, though, it does not generate neoantigens todrive durable anti-neoplastic immune responses. Fortunately, MPS1 shares kinase homology with CDC2-likekinase (CLK2), a key regulator of mRNA splicing, and dual MPS1/CLK2 inhibitors have been developed. Thisprovides the unique opportunity to additionally dive durable anti-tumor immune responses throughsimultaneous pharmacological disruption of mRNA splicing. Indeed, pharmacological modulation of splicingwas recently demonstrated as a definitive, untapped method to generate neoantigens that elicit anti-tumorimmune responses. The overall goal of this fellowship proposal is, therefore, to provide advanced post-doctoraltraining in translational cancer immunotherapy research while evaluating a novel approach to enhanceimmunogenicity in a highly aggressive and resistant form of NSCLC. We will accomplish this by (1) validatingthe effect of epigenetic de-repression of STING and pulsed MPS1 inhibition in clinical samples of ICB-resistant,KL-mutated NSCLC and (2) examining mRNA splice disruption and neoantigen generation in dual MPS1/CLK2inhibitor treated KL-mutated NSCLC. Together these aims will seek to improve therapeutic outcomes forpatients with NSCLC while enhancing the pool of highly trained physician-scientists.

TI  - Clinicopathologic correlates of first-line pembrolizumab effectiveness in patients with advanced NSCLC and a PD-L1 expression of ≥ 50%
T2  - CANCER IMMUNOLOGY IMMUNOTHERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Single-agent pembrolizumab represents the standard first-line option for metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with a PD-L1 (programmed death-ligand 1) expression of >= 50%. Methods We conducted a multicenter retrospective study aimed at evaluating the clinicopathologic correlates of pembrolizumab effectiveness in patients with treatment-naive NSCLC and a PD-L1 expression of >= 50%. Results One thousand and twenty-six consecutive patients were included. The objective response rate (ORR) was 44.5% (95% CI 40.2-49.1), while the median progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 7.9 months (95% CI 6.9-9.5; 599 events) and 17.2 months (95% CI 15.3-22.3; 598 censored patients), respectively. ECOG-PS >= 2 (p < 0.0001) and bone metastases (p = 0.0003) were confirmed to be independent predictors of a worse ORR. Former smokers (p = 0.0002), but not current smokers (p = 0.0532) were confirmed to have a significantly prolonged PFS compared to never smokers at multivariate analysis. ECOG-PS (p < 0.0001), bone metastases (p < 0.0001) and liver metastases (p < 0.0001) were also confirmed to be independent predictors of a worse PFS. Previous palliative RT was significantly related to a shortened OS (p = 0.0104), while previous non-palliative RT was significantly related to a prolonged OS (p = 0.0033). Former smokers (p = 0.0131), but not current smokers (p = 0.3433) were confirmed to have a significantly prolonged OS compared to never smokers. ECOG-PS (p < 0.0001), bone metastases (p < 0.0001) and liver metastases (p < 0.0001) were also confirmed to be independent predictors of a shortened OS. A PD-L1 expression of >= 90%, as assessed by recursive partitioning, was associated with significantly higher ORR (p = 0.0204), and longer and OS (p = 0.0346) at multivariable analysis. Conclusion Pembrolizumab was effective in a large cohort of NSCLC patients treated outside of clinical trials. Questions regarding the effectiveness in clinical subgroups, such as patients with poorer PS and with liver/bone metastases, still remain to be addressed. We confirmed that the absence of tobacco exposure, and the presence of bone and liver metastasis are associated with worse clinical outcomes to pembrolizumab. Increasing levels of PD-L1 expression may help identifying a subset of patients who derive a greater benefit from pembrolizumab monotherapy.

TI  - Relating Drugs to Genotypes to Transform Precision Cancer Therapeutics with Tuba-seq - a Novel, Highly Scalable and Quantitative Preclinical Experimental Oncology Platform
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - PROJECT SUMMARYD2G Oncology, Inc. proposes to develop a novel preclinical experimental platform that will effectively relatecancer drugs to genotypes (“D2G”) to predict pharmacogenomic interactions. D2G Oncology's innovativeapproach dramatically improves on established autochthonous mouse models of human cancer. These provenmodels allow controlled genomic alterations to initiate tumors in vivo in an appropriate immune-competentmicroenvironment and faithfully recapitulate progression of human cancer. D2G's innovative methods for thefirst time enable these animal models to become truly scalable and rigorously quantitative, and hence prac-tical to support drug discovery. D2G's approach can efficiently interrogate a large matrix of tumor genotypes topredict differential patient responses to therapies. Pharmaceutical companies are eager to obtain this infor-mation. D2G will significantly advance the state of the art in precision cancer therapy by helping pharma torationally select candidate compounds to advance and better match them to patients. D2G's oncology platformwill increase the success rate of clinical trials and lead to more effective personalized cancer treatments.The key innovation is a novel tumor barcoding and sequencing (Tuba-seq) pipeline. Every clonal tumor isuniquely barcoded, so the identity and number of cancer cells in each tumor can be readily quantified frombulk tumor-bearing tissues. Combined with lentiviral-mediated CRISPR/Cas9 somatic genome editing, tumorbarcoding allows many predefined tumor genotypes to be generated all at once in individual animals andtracked separately. Tuba-seq enables many tens of experiments (which would each ordinarily require separatecohorts of mice) to be multiplexed into a single mouse. Compared with conventional genetically engineeredmouse models, this approach enormously enhances scalability, introduces rigorous quantification, and reducessources of variation.The overall goal of the proposed Direct Phase 2 SBIR project is to transform the Tuba-seq pipeline into a robustplatform that can be marketed as a commercial service to pharmaceutical companies. Specific aims are to (1)expand the panel of tumor suppressor genes that the platform interrogates and carefully calibrate their effectsizes and (2) rigorously validate the ability of the platform to resolve small but clinically meaningful differencesin tumor suppressor gene-drug effect sizes with high statistical confidence, relying only on small cohorts of ani-mals.D2G will create the first practical and scalable preclinical experimental modeling approach that can assess howcandidate drugs interact with diverse, precisely-engineered cancer genotypes to predict differential patientresponses to therapy.

TI  - A trial-based cost-utility analysis of sugemalimab vs. placebo as consolidation therapy for unresectable stage III NSCLC in China
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveThe effectiveness of sugemalimab vs. placebo in post-chemoradiotherapy patients with locally advanced, unresectable stage III NSCLC has been demonstrated and approved by China National Medical Products Administration. The purpose of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of sugemalimab vs. placebo for consolidation treatment of stage III NSCLC from the perspective of the Chinese healthcare system. MethodsA 3-state Markov model with a 3-week cycle length was performed to appraise the incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) of sugemalimab consolidation therapy based on the GEMSTONE-301 clinical trial over a 10-year time horizon. Only direct medical costs, including costs of drug (maintenance and subsequent treatment), routine follow-up, best supportive care, and terminal care in end of life were considered in this model. Costs and health utilities were obtained from local databases and published articles. Sensitivity and scenario analyses were adopted to evaluate the model uncertainty. Internal and external data sources were used to justify the plausibility of the extrapolated portion of the survival model chosen. ResultsIn comparison with the placebo, sugemalimab consolidation therapy was not cost-effective as it yielded an ICUR value of $90,277 and $49,692 for the concurrent chemoradiotherapy (cCRT) and the sequential chemoradiotherapy (sCRT) population at the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $37,663/QALYs, respectively. When taking the sugemalimab patient assistance program (PAP) into consideration, sugemalimab consolidation therapy was cost-effective with an ICUR dramatic decreases below the WTP. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the ICUR was most sensitive to the discount rate and subsequent treatment. However, none of the sensitive parameters could affect the cost-effective conclusions without or with PAP. Scenario analyses revealed that the model was particularly affected by assumptions regarding discount in sugemalimab, time horizon, mean duration of sugemalimab maintenance treatment. ConclusionsFrom the perspective of Chinese healthcare system, sugemalimab consolidation therapy was not a cost-effective strategy in cCRT and sCRT patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC. Given that the sugemalimab PAP was available, sugemalimab consolidation therapy became a cost-effective option.

TI  - Baseline total metabolic tumour volume on 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D- GLUCOSE POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY-COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY as a promising biomarker in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer treated with first-line pembrolizumab
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have become the standard of care in the management of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Nevertheless, only a small proportion of patients benefit from ICIs. The aim of the present study is to assess whether 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-GLUCOSE POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY-COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY ([18F]FDG-PET/CT)-derived parameters may be used as biomarkers in patients with advanced NSCLC receiving first-line pembrolizumab.Materials and methods: This is a monocentric retrospective cohort study including patients with advanced NSCLC (stage IV) and Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression >= 50% treated with pembrolizumab. A control group of patients treated with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors for EGFR-mutated NSCLC was also enrolled. Only patients with a positive [18F]18F-FDG PET/CT result within 60 days from treatment initiation were included.Total metabolic tumour volume (tMTV) was calculated for each lesion using a dedicated software (PET VCAR; GE Healthcare), which semiautomatically delineates the tumour's contours with a maximum standardised uptake value (SUVmax) threshold of 42% within the lesion. tMTV was obtained summing each lesion's MTV. Potential prognostic parameters for overall survival (OS) were analysed (tMTV, SUVmax, bone/liver metastasis, neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio >= 4, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status >= 2, lactate dehydrogenase above the upper limit of normal).Results: Overall, 34 patients treated with first line-pembrolizumab and 40 patients treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors were included. In the pembrolizumab group, the median follow- up was 20.3, while the median OS was 4.7 months (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.3-9.1) for patients with tMTV >= 75 cm(3) vs not reached (NR) for patients with tMTV <75 cm(3) (95% CI Z NReNR; hazard ratio [HR] = 5.37; 95% CI = 1.72-16.77; p = 0.004). No difference was found in the control group (HR = 1.43; 95% CI = 0.61 -3.34; p = 0.411).Conclusion: Our data suggest that tMTV >= 75cm(3) can be used as a prognostic biomarker of poor outcomes in patients with PD-L1-high advanced NSCLC treated with first-line pembrolizumab. This information could be useful for the selection of patients who may require the addition of chemotherapy to pembrolizumab. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Sex difference in response to non-small cell lung cancer immunotherapy: an updated meta-analysis
T2  - ANNALS OF MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Background Studying sex differences in the efficacy of immunotherapy may contribute to the practice of the precision medicine, especially in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a kind of cancer with sexual bimorphism. Methods Published randomized controlled trials (RCTs), published by PubMed, Medline, Embase, and Scopus, before 15 June 2022, testing immunotherapy (CTLA-4 or PD-1/L1 inhibitor alone, combination or with chemotherapy) versus non-immunotherapy (receiving chemotherapy or placebo only) were included to assess different efficacy between males and females. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). This meta-analysis was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42022298439). Results Sixteen RCTs, involving 10,155 patients with advanced NSCLC, was collected in this meta-analysis. The pooled HR comparing immunotherapy vs non-immunotherapy were 0.76 (95%CI 0.71-0.81) for males and 0.74 (95%CI 0.63-0.87) for females. The pooled HRs comparing immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy were 0.79 (95%CI 0.70-0.89) for males and 0.63 (95%CI 0.42-0.92) for females. The pooled HRs comparing ICIs versus chemotherapy were 0.74 (95%CI 0.67-0.81) for males and 0.83 (95%CI 0.73-0.95) for females. In squamous NSCLC, the pooled HRs comparing immunotherapy vs non-immunotherapy were 0.73 (95%CI 0.58-0.91) for males and 0.74 (95%CI 0.37-1.48) for females. In non-squamous NSCLC, the pooled HRs comparing immunotherapy versus non-immunotherapy were 0.62 (95%CI 0.71-0.94) for males and 0.59 (95%CI 0.39-0.89) for females. Conclusion Compared to chemotherapy, immunotherapy can improve the prognosis of patients with advanced NSCLC. Meanwhile, there are sex differences in the efficacy of immunotherapy. KEY MESSAGE Compared to chemotherapy, immunotherapy can improve the prognosis of patients with advanced NSCLC. The most interesting thing in this study is that immunotherapy showed significant sex differences in the treatment of squamous NSCLC.

TI  - Efficacy and Toxicity of Different Chemotherapy Protocols for Concurrent Chemoradiation in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer-A Secondary Analysis of the PET Plan Trial
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple SummaryConcurrent chemoradiation (cCRT) with a platinum-based doublet, followed by immunotherapy, is the treatment of choice in locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer. A remaining open question is the difference between cisplatin and carboplatin in combination with second and third generation agents for concurrent chemoradiation, as they have a substantially different toxicity profile and data are scarce and inconclusive concerning cCRT. We here present a secondary analysis of the international PET Plan trial in order to assess the efficacy and toxicity of different chemotherapy regimens as well as the difference between the commonly used platinum based agents, cisplatin and carboplatin. All regimens were well tolerated and cisplatin in combination with vinorelbin either as a single dose or daily doses per cycle showed comparable efficacy. Patients treated with carboplatin doublets had a worse survival, but after adjusting for possibly relevant factors, this difference became non-significant, probably due to existing selection bias.(1) Background: The optimal chemotherapy (CHT) regimen for concurrent chemoradiation (cCRT) is not well defined. In this secondary analysis of the international randomized PET-Plan trial, we evaluate the efficacy of different CHT. (2) Methods: Patients with inoperable NSCLC were randomized at a 1:1 ratio regarding the target volume definition and received isotoxically dose-escalated cCRT using cisplatin 80 mg/m(2) (day 1, 22) and vinorelbin 15 mg/m(2) (day 1, 8, 22, 29) (P1) or cisplatin 20 mg/m(2) (day 1-5, 29-33) and vinorelbin 12.5 mg/m(2) (day 1, 8, 15, 29, 36, 43) (P2) or carboplatin AUC1 (day 1-5, 29-33) and vinorelbin 12.5 mg/m(2) (day 1, 8, 15, 29, 36, 43) (P3) or other CHT at the treating physician's discretion. (3) Results: Between 05/2009 and 11/2016, 205 patients were randomized and 172 included in the per-protocol analysis. Patients treated in P1 or P2 had a better overall survival (OS) compared to P3 (p = 0.015, p = 0.01, respectively). Patients treated with carboplatin had a worse OS compared to cisplatin (HR 1.78, p = 0.03), but the difference did not remain significant after adjusting for age, ECOG, cardiac function creatinine and completeness of CHT. (4) Conclusions: Carboplatin doublets show no significant difference compared to cisplatin, after adjusting for possibly relevant factors, probably due to existing selection bias.

TI  - Predictive Value of Modified Glasgow Prognostic Score and Persistent Inflammation among Patients with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Treated with Durvalumab Consolidation after Chemoradiotherapy: A Multicenter Retrospective Study
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary: Durvalumab consolidation after chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is a standard treatment for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer, which sometimes encounters early recurrence. This retrospective study aimed to identify the predictors of durvalumab consolidation after CRT. A prognostic risk classification was created combining modified Glasgow Prognostic Score (mGPS) before CRT and C-reactive protein (CRP) level after CRT. When patients with pre-CRT mGPS of 0 or mGPS of 1 with post-CRT CRP <= 1 mg/dL were classified as the "low-risk" group, and patients with pre-CRT mGPS of 2 or mGPS of 1 with post-CRT CRP >1 mg/dL were classified as the "high-risk" group, the high-risk group had a significantly shorter median progression-free survival (PFS, hazard ratio [HR]: 2.47, p < 0.001) and overall survival (OS, HR: 3.62, p < 0.001) compared with those in the low-risk group. The prognostic risk classification helps to predict the PFS and OS of durvalumab consolidation after CRT.Background: Durvalumab consolidation after chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is a standard treatment for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, studies on immunological and nutritional markers to predict progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) are inadequate. Systemic inflammation causes cancer cachexia and negatively affects immunotherapy efficacy, which also reflects survival outcomes. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively investigated 126 patients from seven institutes in Japan. Results: The modified Glasgow Prognostic Score (mGPS) values, before and after CRT, were the essential predictors among the evaluated indices. A systemic inflammation-based prognostic risk classification was created by combining mGPS values before CRT, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels after CRT, to distinguish tumor-derived inflammation from CRT-induced inflammation. Patients were classified into high-risk (n = 31) and low-risk (n = 95) groups, and the high-risk group had a significantly shorter median PFS of 7.2 months and an OS of 19.6 months compared with the low-risk group. The hazard ratios for PFS and OS were 2.47 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.46-4.19, p < 0.001) and 3.62 (95% CI: 1.79-7.33, p < 0.001), respectively. This association was also observed in the subgroup with programmed cell death ligand 1 expression of >= 50%, but not in the <50% subgroup. Furthermore, durvalumab discontinuation was observed more frequently in the high-risk group than in the low-risk group. Conclusion: Combining pre-CRT mGPS values with post-CRT CRP levels in patients with locally advanced NSCLC helps to predict the PFS and OS of durvalumab consolidation after CRT.

TI  - Contribution of Enhanced Locoregional Control to Improved Overall Survival with Consolidative Durvalumab after Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy in Locally Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: Insights from Real-World Data
T2  - CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose This study aimed to assess the real-world clinical outcomes of consolidative durvalumab in patients with unresectable locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC) and to explore the role of radiotherapy in the era of immunotherapy. Materials and Methods This retrospective study assessed 171 patients with unresectable LA-NSCLC who underwent concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) with or without consolidative durvalumab at Asan Medical Center between May 2018 and May 2021. Primary outcomes included freedom from locoregional failure (FFLRF), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), progression-free survival Results Durvalumab following CCRT demonstrated a prolonged median PFS of 20.9 months (p=0.048) and a 3-year FFLRF rate of 57.3% (p=0.008), compared to 13.7 months and 38.8%, respectively, with CCRT alone. Furthermore, the incidence of in-field recurrence was significantly greater in the CCRT-alone group compared to the durvalumab group (26.8% vs. 12.4%, p=0.027). While median OS was not reached with durvalumab, it was 35.4 months in patients receiving CCRT alone (p=0.010). Patients positive for programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression showed notably better outcomes, including FFLRF, DMFS, PFS, and OS. Adherence to PACIFIC trial eligibility criteria identified 100 patients (58.5%) as ineligible. The use of durvalumab demonstrated better survival regardless of eligibility criteria. Conclusion The use of durvalumab consolidation following CCRT significantly enhanced locoregional control and OS in patients with unresectable LA-NSCLC, especially in those with PD-L1-positive tumors, thereby validating the role of durvalumab in standard care.

TI  - Operability and Pathological Response of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) after Neoadjuvant Therapy with Immune Checkpoint Inhibition
T2  - PNEUMOLOGIE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The blockade of immune escape mechanisms (e. g. PD1 /PD-L1) using immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) can significantly prolong survival and induce remission in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Less is known about neoadjuvant ICI in patients with resectable (UICC stage III) or oligometastatic (UICC stage IVa) NSCLC. Methods Tissue biopsies from patients with advanced or oligometastatic NSCLC were screened for PD-L1 expression. In case of PD-L1-expression > 50 %, ECOG status of 0 or 1 and expected operability, patients received ICI. After about four weeks, patients underwent thoracic surgical resection. In all patients, a complete staging, including PET-CT, cMRI, and endobronchial ultrasound, was performed. The tolerability, the radiological and the histopathological tumor response as well as the surgical and oncological outcomes were analyzed. Findings Four patients (2 male, 2 female, age 56 - 78 years, n = 3 adenocarcinoma, n = 1 squamous cell carcinoma) with local advanced tumors received ICI before surgical resection. In three cases the mediastinal lymph nodes were positive. One patient had a single cerebral metastasis which was treated with radiotherapy. All four patients underwent therapy with two to six cycles of ICI (3 x pembrolizumab, 1 x atezolizumab) without any complication, and ICI did not delay the time of surgical resection. According to iRECIST, three patients showed partial response (PR), one patient had stable disease (SD). All tumors were completely resected. The thoracic surgical procedures proved to be technically unproblematic despite inflammatory changes. There were neither treatment-related deaths nor perioperative complications. In the resectates, complete pathological response (CPR, regression grade III ) and regression grade IIb were detected twice. The average time of follow-up was 12 (1 - 24) months. Patients with PPR developed distant metastasis after six months or a local recurrence after four months. The CPR patient is relapse free to date. Conclusion In selected patients, neoadjuvant therapy with ICI is well tolerated and can induce a complete remission of the tumor. Treatment with ICI has no negative impact on the surgical procedure. Prognosis seems to be promising in CPR and limited in PPR.

TI  - Avelumab for patients with previously treated metastatic or recurrent non-small-cell lung cancer (JAVELIN Solid Tumor): dose-expansion cohort of a multicentre, open-label, phase 1b trial
T2  - LANCET ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Avelumab, a human Ig-G1 monoclonal antibody targeting PD-L1 and approved in the USA for the treatment of metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma, has shown antitumour activity and an acceptable safety profile in patients with advanced solid tumours in a dose-escalation phase 1a trial. In this dose-expansion cohort of that trial, we assess avelumab treatment in a cohort of patients with advanced, platinum-treated non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Methods In this dose-expansion cohort of a multicentre, open-label, phase 1 study, patients with progressive or platinum-resistant metastatic or recurrent NSCLC were enrolled at 58 cancer treatment centres and academic hospitals in the USA. Eligible patients had confirmed stage IIIB or IV NSCLC with squamous or non-squamous histology, measurable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), tumour biopsy or archival sample for biomarker assessment, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 or 1, among other criteria. Patient selection was not based on PD-L1 expression or expression of other biomarkers, including EGFR or KRAS mutation or ALK translocation status. Patients received infusional avelumab monotherapy 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks until disease progression or toxicity. The primary objective was to assess safety and tolerability. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01772004; enrolment in this cohort is closed and the trial is ongoing.Findings Between Sept 10, 2013, and June 24, 2014, 184 patients were enrolled and initiated treatment with avelumab. Median follow-up duration was 8.8 months (IQR 7.2-11.9). The most common treatment-related adverse events of any grade were fatigue (46 [25%] of 184 patients), infusion-related reaction (38 [21%]), and nausea (23 [13%]). Grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse events occurred in 23 (13%) of 184 patients; the most common (occurring in more than two patients) were infusion-related reaction (four [2%] patients) and increased lipase level (three [2%]). 16 (9%) of 184 patients had a serious adverse event related to treatment with avelumab, with infusion-related reaction (in four [2%] patients) and dyspnoea (in two [1%]) occurring in more than one patient. Serious adverse events irrespective of cause occurred in 80 (44%) of 184 patients. Those occurring in more than five patients (>= 3%) were dyspnoea (ten patients [5%]), pneumonia (nine [5%]), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (six [3%]). Immune-related treatment-related events occurred in 22 patients (12%). Of 184 patients, 22 (12% [95% CI 8-18]) achieved a confirmed objective response, including one complete response and 21 partial responses. 70 (38%) had stable disease. Overall, 92 (50%) of 184 patients achieved disease control (they had a confirmed response or stable disease as their best overall response). One patient was initially thought to have died from grade 5 radiation pneumonitis during the study; however, this adverse event was subsequently regraded to grade 3 and the death was attributed to disease progression.Interpretation Avelumab showed an acceptable safety profile and antitumour activity in patients with progressive or treatment-resistant NSCLC, providing a rationale for further studies of avelumab in this disease setting.

The proposal formulates the first in silico predictorto estimate drug’s immunomodulatory effect and potential to synergize with immunotherapies. Aim 1 builds a novel deeplearning predictor —DeepImmune— to predict immunotherapy response from transcriptomes. Aim 2 estimates theimmunomodulatory effects of drugs from for its drug-induced transcriptomic changes using DeepImmune. Aim 3prioritize top predicted immunomodulatory drugs and validate their effect in pre-clinical models.Outcomes/Impact: The successful completion of the proposal will result in a robust predictor to rationally combinecancer therapies with immunotherapy and set the basis for a clinical trial to test the most promising combination therapy.The career development award and mentored research will enable Dr. Sahu to become a leader in the new field of researchat the intersection of precision immuno-oncology and AI.

TI  - Phase 1 Trial of Pembrolizumab Administered Concurrently With Chemoradiotherapy for Locally Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer A Nonrandomized Controlled Trial
T2  - JAMA ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Question What is the preliminary evidence of safety and tolerability of programmed cell death 1 inhibition concurrently with definitive chemoradiotherapy for stage III non-small cell lung cancer? Findings In this phase 1 nonrandomized controlled trial of chemoradiotherapy with concurrent programmed cell death 1 blockade, grade 4 pneumonitis was the predetermined dose-limiting toxic effect used to define safety. Programmed cell death 1 inhibition and chemoradiotherapy for stage III non-small cell lung cancer was tolerable and showed an 18% rate of grade 3 or greater immune-related adverse events, including grades 3 and 5 pneumonitis, grade 3 interstitial nephritis, and type 1 diabetes. Meaning First-line therapy with programmed cell death 1 inhibition and chemoradiotherapy for stage III non-small cell lung cancer appears to be tolerable and should continue to be evaluated in phase 2 and 3 clinical trials.IMPORTANCE Consolidative programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L) inhibition after chemoradiotherapy improves overall survival and progression-free survival (PFS) for stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and requires safety evaluation for incorporation of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) inhibition at the onset of chemoradiotherapy.OBJECTIVE To determine the safety and tolerability of PD-1 inhibition concurrently with definitive chemoradiotherapy for NSCLC.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This phase 1 prospective multicenter nonrandomized controlled trial using a 3 plus 3 design was performed from August 30, 2016, to October 24, 2018, with a median follow-up of 16.0 (95% CI, 12.0-22.6) months and data locked on July 25, 2019. Twenty-one participants had locally advanced, unresectable, stage III NSCLC as determined by multidisciplinary review, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 or 1, and adequate hematologic, renal, and hepatic function. Data were analyzed from October 17, 2016, to July 19, 2019.INTERVENTIONS Pembrolizumab was combined with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (weekly carboplatin and paclitaxel with 60 Gy of radiation in 2 Gy per d). Dose cohorts evaluated included full-dose pembrolizumab (200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks) 2 to 6 weeks after chemoradiotherapy (cohort 1); reduced-dose pembrolizumab (100 mg intravenously every 3 weeks) starting day 29 of chemoradiotherapy (cohort 2); full-dose pembrolizumab starting day 29 of chemoradiotherapy (cohort 3); reduced-dose pembrolizumab starting day 1 of chemoradiotherapy (cohort 4); and full-dose pembrolizumab starting day 1 of chemoradiotherapy (cohort 5). A safety expansion cohort of 6 patients was planned based on the maximum tolerated dose of pembrolizumab. Dose-limiting toxic effects were defined as pneumonitis of at least grade 4 within cycle 1 of pembrolizumab treatment.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Safety and tolerability of PD-1 inhibition with chemoradiotherapy for NSCLC. Secondary outcomes included PFS and pneumonitis rates.RESULTS Among the 21 patients included in the analysis (11 female [52%]; median age, 69.5 [range, 53.0-85.0] years), no dose-limiting toxic effects in any cohort were observed. One case of grade 5 pneumonitis occurred in the safety expansion cohort with the cohort 5 regimen. Immune-related adverse events of at least grade 3 occurred in 4 patients (18%). Median PFS for patients who received at least 1 dose of pembrolizumab (n = 21) was 18.7 (95% CI, 11.8-29.4) months, and 6- and 12-month PFS were 81.0% (95% CI, 64.1%-97.7%) and 69.7% (95% CI, 49.3%-90.2%), respectively. Median PFS for patients who received at least 2 doses of pembrolizumab (n = 19) was 21.0 (95% CI, 15.3 to infinity) months.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These findings suggest that combined treatment with PD-1 inhibitors and chemoradiotherapy for stage III NSCLC is tolerable, with promising PFS of 69.7% at 12 months, and requires further study.This phase 1 nonrandomized controlled trial assesses the safety and tolerability of programmed cell death 1 inhibition concurrently with definitive chemoradiotherapy compared with programmed cell death 1 inhibition and radiotherapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.

TI  - Impact of chemoradiotherapy on the immune-related tumour microenvironment and efficacy of anti-PD-(L)1 therapy for recurrences after chemoradiotherapy in patients with unresectable locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: A history of radiotherapy and chemoradiotherapy (CRT) reportedly increases the efficacy of the PD-1 blockade in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We investigated the efficacy of anti-PD-(L)1 therapy after CRT failure and how CRT changes the status of PD-L1 expression on tumours and on tumour-infiltrated lymphocytes (TILs).Methods: We retrospectively reviewed patients with unresectable locally advanced NSCLC (LA-NSCLC) who were treated with CRT between 2007 and 2018 and evaluated the efficacy of the PD-(L)1 blockade after CRT failure. We also compared the PD-L1 (clone: 22C3) expression levels and the tumoral and stromal distributions of CD8-positive TILs using paired formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens obtained before and after CRT.Results: We identified 422 patients and 65 patients who had relapsed after CRT received anti-PD-(L)1 therapy. The objective response rate (ORR) and the progression-free survival (PFS) after anti-PD-(L)1 therapy were 48% and 8.7 months (95% CI, 4.5-13), respectively. The RR and PFS did not differ according to the pre-CRT PD-L1 expression levels. PD-L1 expression changed in 16 of the 18 patients between before and after CRT, but a specific trend was not seen (increased, 9 patients; decreased, 7 patients; no change, 2 patients). In contrast, the density of tumoral CD8-positive TILs increased after CRT treatment (pre-CRT median, 110/mm(2) versus post-CRT median, 470/mm(2); p = 0.025).Conclusions: Anti-PD-(L)1 therapy was effective in patients with LA-NSCLC who had progressed after CRT regardless of their pre-CRT PD-L1 expression. The efficacy of anti-PD(L)1 therapy for patients with NSCLC with CRT failure was superior to that of standard second-line treatment for patients with advanced NSCLC. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Systemic treatment of brain metastases in non-small cell lung cancer
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - Brain metastases (BrMs) are associated with significant morbidity and are found in up to 50% of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Most of the literature focuses on symptomatic BrMs, with a lack of baseline brain imaging in asymptomatic patients. Unfortunately, much of the data on local treatments with or without systemic treatment is retrospective. Clinical trials of systemic treatments largely exclude patients with BrMs.Chemotherapy is an active treatment for BrM with response rates in the brain similar to other sites of disease. Targeted systemic treatments in patients with driver mutations (EGFR and ALK-MET to date) have impressive central nervous system (CNS) penetrance and response rates. Unfortunately, no prospective data can currently guide the timings or modality of local therapies with systemic treatments in these patients who have a high incidence of CNS disease, but retrospective data suggest that early local therapies may give better intracranial progression-free survival (ICPFS).Recent immunotherapy trials have included patients with BrMs. These patients have largely been pre-treated with local therapies and are asymptomatic. Thus, the current standard is becoming, early local therapies before or in conjunction with immunotherapy agents. The approach seems to be safe.Prospective studies are needed in NSCLC BrMs patients to make sure any benefit from local therapies on the ICPFS and quality of life is not overlooked. Here we report what we think are reasonable conclusions from the available data and make suggestions for future clinical trials in the management of NSCLC BrMs. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Upfront Advanced Radiotherapy and New Drugs for NSCLC Patients with Synchronous Brain Metastases: Is the Juice Worth the Squeeze? A Real-World Analysis from Lombardy, Italy
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary This study aims to compare effectiveness and cost profile in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients harboring synchronous brain metastases (BMs) who received non-chemo first-line systemic therapy with or without advanced radiotherapy (aRT). A total of 177 lung cancer patients, of whom 58 were treated with systemic treatment (either TKIs or pembrolizumab) plus aRT (STRT) and 119 with systemic treatment alone, were selected. The addition of aRT to systemic treatment was associated with a significantly better OS (p = 0.020) and PFS (p = 0.041) than systemic therapy alone. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) value indicated an average cost of euro3792 for each month of survival after STRT and confirmed clinical effectiveness but higher healthcare costs. This real-world study suggests that upfront aRT in this setting represents a valid treatment strategy, boosting the efficacy of emerging drug classes with sustainable costs for the health service. Aim: Healthcare administrative databases represent a valuable source for real-life data analysis. The primary aim of this study is to compare effectiveness and cost profile in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients harboring synchronous brain metastases (BMs) who received non-chemo first-line systemic therapy with or without advanced radiotherapy (aRT). Methods: Diagnostic ICD-9-CM codes were used for identifying all patients with a new diagnosis of lung cancer between 2012 and 2019. Among these, patients who had started a first-line systemic treatment with either TKIs or pembrolizumab, alone or in combination with intensity-modulated or stereotactic RT, were selected. Clinical outcomes investigated included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and time-to-treatment failure (TTF). The cost outcome was defined as the average per capita cumulative healthcare direct costs of the treatment, including all inpatient and outpatient costs. Results: The final cohort included 177 patients, of whom 58 were treated with systemic treatment plus aRT (STRT) and 119 with systemic treatment alone. The addition of aRT to systemic treatment was associated with a significantly better OS (p = 0.020) and PFS (p = 0.041) than systemic therapy alone. The ICER (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio) value indicated an average cost of euro3792 for each month of survival after STRT treatment and confirmed clinical effectiveness but higher healthcare costs. Conclusions: This real-world study suggests that upfront aRT for NCLSC patients with synchronous BMs represents a valid treatment strategy, boosting the efficacy of novel and emerging drug classes with sustainable costs for the health service. Translational relevance: The present real-world study reports that the use of upfront advanced radiotherapyaRT and new-generation systemic agents, such as TKIs and pembrolizumab, may have higher oncological control and an improved cost-effectiveness profile than the use of new-generation systemic agents alone in NCLSC patients with synchronous brain metastases. Acquired evidence can also be used to inform policymakers that adding advanced radiotherapy results is a sustainable cost for the health service.Since approximately 50% of patients do not meet RCT inclusion criteria, a significant proportion of them is receiving treatment that is not evidence-informed; therefore, these results warrant further studies to identify the best radiotherapy timing and possible dose escalation approaches to improving treatment efficacy in patient subgroups not typically represented in randomized controlled trials.

TI  - Previous radiotherapy and the clinical activity and toxicity of pembrolizumab in the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer: a secondary analysis of the KEYNOTE-001 phase 1 trial
T2  - LANCET ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Preclinical studies have found radiotherapy enhances antitumour immune responses. We aimed to assess disease control and pulmonary toxicity in patients who previously received radiotherapy for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) before receiving pembrolizumab.Methods We assessed patients with advanced NSCLC treated on the phase 1 KEYNOTE-001 trial at a single institution (University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA). Patients were aged 18 years or older, had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 1 or less, had adequate organ function, and no history of pneumonitis. Patients received pembrolizumab at a dose of either 2 mg/kg of bodyweight or 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks, or 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks, until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or other protocol-defined reasons for discontinuation. Disease response and pulmonary toxicity were prospectively assessed by Immune-related Response Criteria and Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. The primary objective of the KEYNOTE-001 trial was to assess the safety, side-effect profile, and antitumour activity of pembrolizumab. For our secondary analysis, patients were divided into subgroups to compare patients who previously received radiotherapy with patients who had not. Our primary objective was to determine whether previous radiotherapy affected progression-free survival, overall survival, and pulmonary toxicity in the intention-to-treat population. The KEYNOTE-001 trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01295827.Findings Between May 22, 2012, and July 11, 2014, 98 patients were enrolled and received their first cycle of pembrolizumab. One patient was lost to follow-up. 42 (43%) of 97 patients had previously received any radiotherapy for the treatment of NSCLC before the first cycle of pembrolizumab. 38 (39%) of 97 patients received extracranial radiotherapy and 24 (25%) of 97 patients received thoracic radiotherapy. Median follow-up for surviving patients was 32.5 months (IQR 29.8-34.1). Progression-free survival with pembrolizumab was significantly longer in patients who previously received any radiotherapy than in patients without previous radiotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] 0.56 [95% CI 0.34-0.91], p= 0.019; median progression-free survival 4.4 months [95% CI 2.1-8.6] vs 2.1 months [1.6-2.3]) and for patients who previously received extracranial radiotherapy compared with those without previous extracranial radiotherapy (HR 0.50 [0.30-0.84], p= 0.0084; median progression-free survival 6.3 months [95% CI 2.1-10.4] vs 2.0 months [1.8-2.1]). Overall survival with pembrolizumab was significantly longer in patients who previously received any radiotherapy than in patients without previous radiotherapy (HR 0.58 [95% CI 0.36-0.94], p= 0.026; median overall survival 10.7 months [95% CI 6.5-18.9] vs 5.3 months [2.7-7.7]) and for patients who previously received extracranial radiotherapy compared with those without previous extracranial radiotherapy (0.59 [95% CI 0.36-0.96], p=0.034; median overall survival 11.6 months [95% CI 6.5-20.5] vs 5.3 months [3.0-8.5]). 15 (63%) of 24 patients who had previously received thoracic radiotherapy had any recorded pulmonary toxicity versus 29 (40%) of 73 patients with no previous thoracic radiotherapy. Three (13%) patients with previous thoracic radiotherapy had treatment-related pulmonary toxicity compared with one (1%) of those without; frequency of grade 3 or worse treatment-related pulmonary toxicities was similar (one patient in each group).Interpretation Our data suggest that previous treatment with radiotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC results in longer progression-free survival and overall survival with pembrolizumab treatment than that seen in patients who did not have previous radiotherapy, with an acceptable safety profile. Further clinical trials investigating this combination are needed to determine the optimal treatment strategy for patients with advanced NSCLC.

TI  - Concurrent irradiation with the anti-programmed cell death ligand-1 immune checkpoint blocker durvalumab: Single centre subset analysis from a phase 1/2 trial
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: To assess preliminary safety and efficacy results of the anti-programmed cell death ligand-1 (anti-PD-L1) durvalumab in combination with radiotherapy (RT) in an expansion cohort of patients included in a phase 1/2 trial at our institution.Patients and methods: Data from patients who received concurrent palliative RT with durvalumab (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks via intravenous infusion) were analysed in terms of safety (CTCAE v4.0) and efficacy (RECIST v1.1 and tumour growth rate [TGR]).Results: Between 02/2014 and 04/2016, 10 patients received palliative local irradiation of 15 isolated lesions. Most patients (90%) had received one or more prior lines of systemic therapy for advanced disease. The median duration of exposure to durvalumab was 5.2 months with a median delivery of 11 cycles (range, 4-38 cycles). RT (conformal 3D RT, 79% and intracranial stereotactic RT, 21%) was delivered at a median biologically-effective dose of 28 Gy (range, 6-92), in a median number of five fractions (range, 1-10) and over a median duration of 6 d (range, 1-14). Five patients (50%) reported an irradiation-related adverse event (AE) grade (G) 1 or 2 and one patient had two G2 AEs. The most frequently reported AE (3/6) was G2 mucositis. There was no G3 or more RT-related AEs. All AEs were transient, lasted less than one week, and were manageable by standard guidelines. There was no unexpected AE. On 10/15 in-field (IF) evaluable lesions, the objective response (OR) rate was 60% (complete response, 2/10 and partial response, 4/10) and 4/10 stable disease (SD). All evaluated IF lesions had a TGR decrease resulting in a significant decrease in the TGR between the two periods (before versus after RT; p < 0.01). Outfields disease evaluation retrieved 10/14 SD and 4/14 progressive disease (PD). There was no out-field OR, no abscopal effect and no out-field difference between the two periods according to TGR (p = 0.09).Conclusion: In this small data set of patients, concurrent palliative RT with the anti-PD-L1 durvalumab was well tolerated.

TI  - Induction Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors and Chemotherapy Before Definitive Chemoradiation Therapy for Patients With Bulky Unresectable Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION ONCOLOGY BIOLOGY PHYSICS

AB  - Purpose: In the era of immunotherapy, the treatment for bulky, locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC) remains challenging. This study explored the feasibility of induction immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) plus chemotherapy before definitive chemoradiation therapy (CRT) for bulky LA-NSCLC.Methods and Materials: Patients with bulky, unresectable stage III NSCLC (primary tumor =5 cm in greatest dimension or metastatic lymph nodes =2 cm in shortest diameter) receiving ICIs and chemotherapy before CRT from 2018 to 2022 were identified. Survival outcomes and toxic effects were analyzed. Radiation therapy plans on computed tomography images before and after 2 cycles of induction chemoimmunotherapy were simulated to evaluate dosimetric outcomes. Results: Seventy-five patients were included. One- and 2-year overall-survival (OS) rates were 91.5% (95% CI, 85.2%-98.3%) and 75.1% (95% CI, 64.1%-88.0%), respectively. One- and 2-year progression-free-survival (PFS) rates were 85.8% (95% CI, 78.0%-94.4%) and 64.2% (95% CI, 52.5%-78.6%), respectively. Median OS was not reached (NR). Median PFS was 30.6 months (95% CI, 25.9 months to NR). Grade 2 and =3 pneumonitis occurred in 26.7% and 9.3% of patients, respectively. Grade =3 pneumonitis was significantly associated with poorer OS (P =.003) and PFS (P =.018). Treatment discontinuation was significantly associated with shorter OS (P =.023) and PFS (P =.047). Patients with consolidation ICIs exhibited numerically better OS than those without consolidation ICIs (2-year OS, 85.8% vs 64.2%; P =.170). The objective response rate was 76.1% for induction treatment and 86.7% for induction treatment plus CRT. The disease control rate after 2 cycles of induction therapywas significantly greater than after 4 (P =.046) or more cycles (P =.025). Simulated radiation plans indicated that all target volumes, mean lung dose, and volume of lung parenchyma receiving =5 Gy, =20 Gy, and =30 Gy significantly decreased after 2 cycles (all P <.005).Conclusions: Two cycles of induction ICIs plus chemotherapy before definitive CRT were feasible for bulky LA-NSCLC, with significant tumor reduction and normal lung protection. Further investigations on CRT combined with induction and consolidation ICIs are warranted. (c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - The Multidisciplinary Approach in Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer over Ten Years: From Radiation Therapy Optimisation to Innovative Systemic Treatments
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a highly heterogeneous group of diseases with wide differences in tumor size and in nodal involvement and, although the intent of treatments is potentially curative, survival data still remain disappointing in some cases. The treatment of locally advanced NSCLC involves a multidisciplinary approach to determine which patients might benefit from a trimodality treatment that includes tumour resection and to identify patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC who are candidates for definitive chemo-radiation therapy (CRT). The main aim of this work was to provide a real-world description of treatment evolution and survival outcomes of stage III NSCLC patients referred to the Veneto Institute of Oncology-IRCCS and University Hospital of Padova for about 10 years. Background: About 30% of new non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cases are diagnosed at a locally advanced stage, which includes a highly heterogeneous group of patients with a wide spectrum of treatment options. The management of stage III NSCLC involves a multidisciplinary team, adequate staging, and a careful patient selection for surgery or radiation therapy integrated with systemic treatment. Methods: This is a single-center observational retrospective and prospective study including a consecutive series of stage III NSCLC patients who were referred to the Veneto Institute of Oncology and University Hospital of Padova (Italy) between 2012 and 2021. We described clinico-pathological characteristics, therapeutic pathways, and treatment responses in terms of radiological response in the entire study population and in terms of pathological response in patients who underwent surgery after induction therapy. Furthermore, we analysed survival outcomes in terms of relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). Results: A total of 301 patients were included. The majority of patients received surgical multimodality treatment (n = 223, 74.1%), while the remaining patients (n = 78, 25.9%) underwent definitive CRT followed or not by durvalumab as consolidation therapy. At data cut-off, 188 patients (62.5%) relapsed and the median RFS (mRFS) of the entire population was 18.2 months (95% CI: 15.83-20.57). At the time of analyses 140 patients (46.5%) were alive and the median OS (mOS) was 44.7 months (95% CI: 38.4-51.0). A statistically significant difference both in mRFS (p = 0.002) and in mOS (p < 0.001) was observed according to the therapeutic pathway in the entire population, and selecting patients treated after 2018, a significant difference in mRFS (p = 0.006) and mOS (p < 0.001) was observed according to treatment modality. Furthermore, considering only patients diagnosed with stage IIIB-C (N = 131, 43.5%), there were significant differences both in mRFS (p = 0.047) and in mOS (p = 0.022) as per the treatment algorithm. The mRFS of the unresectable population was 16.3 months (95% CI: 11.48-21.12), with a significant difference among subgroups (p = 0.030) in favour of patients who underwent the PACIFIC-regimen; while the mOS was 46.5 months (95% CI: 26.46-66.65), with a significant difference between two subgroups (p = 0.003) in favour of consolidation immunotherapy. Conclusions: Our work provides insights into the management and the survival outcomes of stage III NSCLC over about 10 years. We found that the choice of radical treatment impacts on outcome, thus suggesting the importance of appropriate staging at diagnosis, patient selection, and of the multidisciplinary approach in the decision-making process.Our results confirmed that the PACIFIC trial and the following introduction of durvalumab as consolidation treatment may be considered as a turning point for several improvements in the diagnostic-therapeutic pathway of stage III NSCLC patients.

TI  - Durvalumab after Chemoradiotherapy in Stage III Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer
T2  - NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUNDMost patients with locally advanced, unresectable, non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have disease progression despite definitive chemoradiotherapy (chemotherapy plus concurrent radiation therapy). This phase 3 study compared the anti-programmed death ligand 1 antibody durvalumab as consolidation therapy with placebo in patients with stage III NSCLC who did not have disease progression after two or more cycles of platinum-based chemoradiotherapy.METHODSWe randomly assigned patients, in a 2: 1 ratio, to receive durvalumab (at a dose of 10 mg per kilogram of body weight intravenously) or placebo every 2 weeks for up to 12 months. The study drug was administered 1 to 42 days after the patients had received chemoradiotherapy. The coprimary end points were progression-free survival (as assessed by means of blinded independent central review) and overall survival (unplanned for the interim analysis). Secondary end points included 12-month and 18-month progression-free survival rates, the objective response rate, the duration of response, the time to death or distant metastasis, and safety.RESULTSOf 713 patients who underwent randomization, 709 received consolidation therapy (473 received durvalumab and 236 received placebo). The median progression-free survival from randomization was 16.8 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 13.0 to 18.1) with durvalumab versus 5.6 months (95% CI, 4.6 to 7.8) with placebo (stratified hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.65; P<0.001); the 12-month progression-free survival rate was 55.9% versus 35.3%, and the 18-month progression-free survival rate was 44.2% versus 27.0%. The response rate was higher with durvalumab than with placebo (28.4% vs. 16.0%; P<0.001), and the median duration of response was longer (72.8% vs. 46.8% of the patients had an ongoing response at 18 months). The median time to death or distant metastasis was longer with durvalumab than with placebo (23.2 months vs. 14.6 months; P<0.001). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in 29.9% of the patients who received durvalumab and 26.1% of those who received placebo; the most common adverse event of grade 3 or 4 was pneumonia (4.4% and 3.8%, respectively). A total of 15.4% of patients in the durvalumab group and 9.8% of those in the placebo group discontinued the study drug because of adverse events.CONCLUSIONSProgression-free survival was significantly longer with durvalumab than with placebo. The secondary end points also favored durvalumab, and safety was similar between the groups.

TI  - Nivolumab for adults with Hodgkin's lymphoma (a rapid review using the software RobotReviewer)
T2  - COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - BackgroundHodgkin's lymphoma (HL) is a cancer of the lymphatic system, and involves the lymph nodes, spleen and other organs such as the liver, lung, bone or bone marrow, depending on the tumour stage. With cure rates of up to 90%, HL is one of the most curable cancers worldwide. Approximately 10% of people with HL will be refractory to initial treatment or will relapse; this is more common in people with advanced stage or bulky disease. Standard of care for these people is high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT), but only 55% of participants treated with high-dose chemotherapy and ASCT are free from treatment failure at three years, with an overall survival (OS) of about 80% at three years.Checkpoint inhibitors that target the interaction of the programmed death (PD)-1 immune checkpoint receptor, and its ligands PDL1 and PD-L2, have shown remarkable activity in a wide range of malignancies. Nivolumab is an anti-(PD)-1 monoclonal antibody and currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma and, since 2016, for classical Hodgkin's lymphoma (cHL) after treatment with ASCT and brentuximab vedotin.Objectives To assess the benefits and harms of nivolumab in adults with HL (irrespective of stage of disease).Search methodsWe searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, conference proceedings and six study registries from January 2000 to May 2018 for prospectively planned trials evaluating nivolumab.Selection criteriaWe included prospectively planned trials evaluating nivolumab in adults with HL. We excluded trials in which less than 80% of participants had HL, unless the trial authors provided the subgroup data for these participants in the publication or after we contacted the trial authors.Data collection and analysisTwo review authors independently extracted data and assessed potential risk of bias. We used the software RobotReviewer to extract data and compared results with our findings. As we did not identify any randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or non-RCTs, we did not meta-analyse data.Main resultsOur search found 782 potentially relevant references. Fromthese, we included three trialswithout a control group, with 283 participants. In addition, we identified 14 ongoing trials evaluating nivolumab, of which two are randomised. Risk of bias of the three included studies was moderate to high. All of the participants were in relapsed stage, most of them were heavily pretreated and had received at least two previous treatments, most of them had also undergone ASCT. As we did not identify any RCTs, we could not use the software RobotReviewer to assess risk of bias. The software identified correctly that one study was not an RCT and did not extract any trial data, but extracted characteristics of the other two studies (although also not RCTs) in a sufficient way.Two studies with 260 participants evaluated OS. After six months, OS was 100% in one study and median OS (the timepoint when only 50% of participants were alive) was not reached in the other trial after a median follow-up of 18 months (interquartile range (IQR) 15 to 22 months) (very low certainty evidence, due to observational trial design, heterogenous patient population in terms of pretreatments and various follow-up times (downgrading by 1 point)). In one study, one out of three cohorts reported quality of life. It was unclear whether there was an effect on quality of life as only a subset of participants filled out the follow-up questionnaire (very low certainty evidence). Three trials (283 participants) evaluated progression-free survival (PFS) (very low certainty evidence). Six-month PFS ranged between 60% and 86%, and median PFS ranged between 12 and 18 months. All three trials (283 participants) reported complete response rates, ranging from 12% to 29%, depending on inclusion criteria and participants' previous treatments (very low certainty evidence).One trial (243 participants) reported drug-related grade 3 or 4 adverse events (AEs) only after a median follow-up of 18 months (IQR 15 to 22 months); these were fatigue (23%), diarrhoea (15%), infusion reactions (14%) and rash (12%). The other two trials (40 participants) reported 23% to 52% grade 3 or 4 AEs after six months' follow-up (very low certainty evidence). Only one trial (243 participants) reported drug-related serious AEs; 2% of participants developed infusion reactions and 1% pneumonitis (very low certainty evidence).None of the studies reported treatment-related mortality.Authors' conclusionsTo date, data on OS, quality of life, PFS, response rate, or short-and long-term AEs are available from small uncontrolled trials only. The three trials included heavily pretreated participants, which had previously undergone regimens of BV or ASCT. For these participants, median OS was not reached after follow-up times of at least 16 months (more than 50% of participants with a limited life expectancy were alive at this timepoint). Only one cohort out of three only reported quality of life, with limited follow-up data so that meaningful conclusions were not possible. Serious adverse events occurred rarely. Currently, data are too sparse to make a clear statement on nivolumab for people with relapsed or refractory HL except for heavily pretreated people, which had previously undergone regimens of BV or ASCT. When interpreting these results, it is important to consider that proper RCTs should confirm these findings.As there are 14 ongoing trials evaluating nivolumab, of which two are RCTs, it is possible that an update of this review will be published in the near future and that this update will show different results to those reported here.

TI  - Local therapy of cancer with free IL-2
T2  - CANCER IMMUNOLOGY IMMUNOTHERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - This is a position paper about the therapeutic effects of locally applied free IL-2 in the treatment of cancer. Local therapy: IL-2 therapy of cancer was originally introduced as a systemic therapy. This therapy led to about 20% objective responses. Systemic therapy however was very toxic due to the vascular leakage syndrome. Nevertheless, this treatment was a break-through in cancer immunotherapy and stimulated some interesting questions: Supposing that the mechanism of IL-2 treatment is both proliferation and tumoricidal activity of the tumor infiltrating cells, then locally applied IL-2 should result in a much higher local IL-2 concentration than systemic IL-2 application. Consequently a greater beneficial effect could be expected after local IL-2 application (peritumoral = juxtatumoral, intratumoral, intra-arterial, intracavitary, or intratracheal = inhalation). Free IL-2: Many groups have tried to prepare a more effective IL-2 formulation than free IL-2. Examples are slow release systems, insertion of the IL-2 gene into a tumor cell causing prolonged IL-2 release. However, logistically free IL-2 is much easier to apply; hence we concentrated in this review and in most of our experiments on the use of free IL-2. Local therapy with free IL-2 may be effective against transplanted tumors in experimental animals, and against various spontaneous carcinomas, sarcomas, and melanoma in veterinary and human cancer patients. It may induce rejection of very large, metastasized tumor loads, for instance advanced clinical tumors. The effects of even a single IL-2 application may be impressive. Not each tumor or tumor type is sensitive to local IL-2 application. For instance transplanted EL4 lymphoma or TLX9 lymphoma were not sensitive in our hands. Also the extent of sensitivity differs: In Bovine Ocular Squamous Cell Carcinoma (BOSCC) often a complete regression is obtained, whereas with the Bovine Vulval Papilloma and Carcinoma Complex (BVPCC) mainly stable disease is attained. Analysis of the results of local IL-2 therapy in 288 cases of cancer in human patients shows that there were 27% Complete Regressions (CR), 23% Partial Regressions (PR), 18% Stable Disease (SD), and 32% Progressive Disease (PD). In all tumors analyzed, local IL-2 therapy was more effective than systemic IL-2 treatment. Intratumoral IL-2 applications are more effective than peritumoral application or application at a distant site. Tumor regression induced by intratumoral IL-2 application may be a fast process (requiring about a week) in the case of a highly vascular tumor since IL-2 induces vascular leakage/edema and consequently massive tumor necrosis. The latter then stimulates an immune response. In less vascular tumors or less vascular tumor sites, regression may require 9-20 months; this regression is mainly caused by a cytotoxic leukocyte reaction. Hence the disadvantageous vascular leakage syndrome complicating systemic treatment is however advantageous in local treatment, since local edema may initiate tumor necrosis. Thus the therapeutic effect of local IL-2 treatment is not primarily based on tumor immunity, but tumor immunity seems to be useful as a secondary component of the IL-2 induced local processes. If local IL-2 is combined with surgery, radiotherapy or local chemotherapy the therapeutic effect is usually greater than with either therapy alone. Hence local free IL-2 application can be recommended as an addition to standard treatment protocols.Local treatment with free IL-2 is straightforward and can readily be applied even during surgical interventios. Local IL-2 treatment is usually without serious side effects and besides minor complaints it is generally well supported. Only small quantities of IL-2 are required. Hence the therapy is relatively cheap. A single IL-2 application of 4.5 million U IL-2 costs about 70 Euros. Thus combined local treatment may offer an alternative in those circumstances when more expensive forms of treatment are not available, for instance in resource poor countries.

The CPP has provided PK support for various agents in phase I/II      trials: suramin, TNP-470, CAI, UCN-01, docetaxel, flavopiridol, thalidomide, lenalidomide,      pomalidomide, intraperitoneal cisplatin/carboplatin, paclitaxel, 17-DMAG, imatinib, sorafenib,      nelfinavir, bevacizumab, romidepsin, clopidrogrel, bortezomib, TRC-105, vandetanib, olaparib,      topotecan, irinotecan, mithramycin, durvalumab, abiraterone, belinostat with cisplatin and      etoposide, temozolomide, seviteronel, selumetinib, and immunotoxin LMB-100. During the current      fiscal year, the CPP provided PK support for several phase I/II clinical studies, including a      first-in-human phase I study of LMB-100 in patients with mesothelioma and other solid tumors      expressing mesothelin; phase I trial of zotiraciclib in combination with temozolomide for      patients with recurrent high-grade astrocytomas; phase I study of lenalidomide and      radiotherapy in children with gliomas; phase II trial of M6620 (a first-in-class competitive      inhibitor of ATR) and topotecan in relapsed SCLC patients; phase II study of pomalidomide in      patients with refractory chronic graft-versus-host disease; phase I/II of cabozantinib and      docetaxel in patients with mCRPC; checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy during pregnancy for      relapsed-refractory Hodgkin lymphoma; phase I study of single agent NIZ985, a recombinant      heterodimeric IL-15 agonist, in adult patients with metastatic or unresectable solid tumors;      phase 1 study of sorafenib and irinotecan in pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory      solid tumors. Over the years, we have conducted population PK (popPK) modeling of the      following compounds: depsipeptide, romidepsin, sorafenib, olaparib, docetaxel in combination      with the p-glycoprotein antagonist tariquidar, TRC105, TRC102, belinostat, mithramycin and      seviteronel. Recent efforts have focused on characterizing the complex PK of NLG207, a      nanoparticle-drug conjugate of the potent topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin (CPT), in      order to better describe CPT release from nanoparticles using a popPK model. In collaboration      with Drs. Mark Ratain and Daniel Goldstein, we're evaluating in silico-based extended dosing      regimens for monoclonal antibody immune checkpoint inhibitors. Based on patient-specific      estimates for clearance, optimal alternative dosing strategies can be simulated to lower drug      and cost burden yet maintain therapeutic levels, especially as the clearance of the drug      decreases over time. We hypothesize that longer dosing intervals than those currently approved      (without commensurate dose increases) will maintain efficacy. To this end, we are      collaborating on a multi-institutional, randomized, non-inferiority trial to investigate the      PK of standard interval dosing compared to extended interval dosing of nivolumab or      pembrolizumab in locally advanced or metastatic cancers. The primary objective is to assess      the noninferiority of extended interval dosing relative to standard dosing, as assessed by      drug trough levels above the target concentration of 1.5 ug/ml for both nivolumab and      pembrolizumab. Nivolumab and pembrolizumab, anti-programmed cell death protein 1 monoclonal      antibodies, have revolutionized oncology but are expensive. Using an interventional      pharmacoeconomic approach, these drugs can be administered less often to reduce costs and      increase patient convenience while maintaining efficacy. Both drugs are good candidates for      less frequent dosing because of long half-lives and no evidence of a relationship of dose to      efficacy. Established population pharmacokinetic models for both nivolumab and pembrolizumab      were used to simulate profiles for multiple dosing regimens on 1000 randomly generated virtual      patients. Simulations were initially performed on standard dose regimens to validate these in      silico predictions. Next, simulations of nivolumab 0.3 mg/kg every 3 weeks revealed that      95% of patients maintained greater than or equal to 1.5 ug/mL at steady state, which was      inferred as the minimum effective concentration (MEC) for both drugs. Various alternative      dosing regimens were simulated for both drugs to determine which regimen(s) can maintain this      MEC in 95% of patients. Extended dosing regimens of nivolumab 240 mg every 4 weeks and 480      mg every 8 weeks along with pembrolizumab 200 mg every 6 weeks were simulated, showing that      95% of patients maintained MEC or greater. These simulations demonstrate the potential to      reduce drug exposure by at least 50%, thus substantially reducing patient visits (as well as      costs), while maintaining equivalent efficacy. These models provide the scientific      justification for an ongoing prospective randomized clinical trial comparing standard interval      fixed dosing with extended interval fixed dosing, and ultimately an efficacy-driven      comparative trial. The CPP participates in several preclinical pharmacology projects in order      to study drug metabolism, PK, drug formulation and bioavailability, as well as efficacy in      preclinical models of drug development to allow for more accurate dosing estimates for future      first-in-human studies. The CPP has validated assays and conducted PK analysis for the      following compounds: 3-deazaneplanocin (DZ-Nep), PV1162, schweinfurthin G, englerin A,      aza-englerin, XZ-419, aurora kinase A/B inhibitor SCH-1473759, and a long-acting prodrug of      talazoparib. We have conducted bioavailability studies for schweinfurthin G, englerin A, and      aza-englerin. We collaborate with both intramural and extramural investigators to evaluate the      preclinical PK of various novel therapeutics in mouse tumor models and/or non-human primate      (NHP) models including 5-azacytidine, pexidartinib, photo-activatable paclitaxel prodrug, and      panobinostat. We evaluated the preclinical PK of sapanisertib (mTORC1/2 inhibitor) and      trametinib (MEK inhibitor) in mucosal melanoma xenograft models. We also investigated how dual      mTORC1/2 inhibition compromises cell defenses against exogenous stress potentiating      obatoclax-induced cytotoxicity in atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors. In collaboration with the      Molecular Targets Laboratory and the Natural Products Branch, the CPP provided preclinical PK      support to study the bioavailability of two new classes of analogs of englerin A (extracted      from the Tanzanian plant Phyllanthus engleri Pax on the basis of its high potency and      selectivity for inhibiting renal cancer cell growth). The first class of analogs are modified      at the esters to improve stability and oral bioavailability, while the second class of analogs      are modified on the bridgehead of the seven-membered ring within the main englerin body of the      compound. Replacement of the isopropyl group by other, larger substituents yielded compounds    *TRUNCATED*

During the current fiscal year, the CPP provided PK support for several phase I/II clinical studies, including a first-in-human phase I study of LMB-100 in patients with mesothelioma and other solid tumors expressing mesothelin; phase I trial of zotiraciclib in combination with temozolomide for patients with recurrent high-grade astrocytomas; phase I study of lenalidomide and radiotherapy in children with gliomas; phase II trial of M6620 (a first-in-class competitive inhibitor of ATR) and topotecan in relapsed SCLC patients; phase II study of pomalidomide in patients with refractory chronic graft-versus-host disease; phase I/II of cabozantinib and docetaxel in patients with mCRPC. Over the years, we have conducted population PK (popPK) modeling of the following compounds: depsipeptide, romidepsin, sorafenib, olaparib, docetaxel in combination with the p-glycoprotein antagonist tariquidar, TRC105, TRC102, belinostat, mithramycin and seviteronel. Recent efforts have focused on characterizing the complex PK of NLG207, a nanoparticle-drug conjugate of the potent topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin (CPT), in order to better describe CPT release from nanoparticles using a popPK model. The PK of NLG207 was characterized by combining two linear two-compartment models with first-order kinetics each to describe nanoparticle-bound (conjugated) and free CPT. CPT release from the nanoparticle formulation was characterized via an initial rapid clearance of 5.71 L/h, which decreased via first-order decay (estimated half-life of 0.307 h) to the steady-state value of 0.0988 L/h by  4 h after end of infusion. Renal clearance of free CPT was 0.874 L/h. The popPK model confirmed nanoparticle behavior of conjugated CPT and mechanistically characterized CPT release from NLG207. The current analysis provides a strong foundation for future study as a potential predictive tool in ongoing NLG207 clinical trials. In collaboration with Drs. Mark Ratain and Daniel Goldstein, we're evaluating in silico-based extended dosing regimens for monoclonal antibody immune checkpoint inhibitors. Based on patient-specific estimates for clearance, optimal alternative dosing strategies can be simulated to lower drug and cost burden yet maintain therapeutic levels, especially as the clearance of the drug decreases over time. We hypothesize that longer dosing intervals than those currently approved (without commensurate dose increases) will maintain efficacy. To this end, we are collaborating on a multi-institutional, randomized, non-inferiority trial to investigate the PK of standard interval dosing compared to extended interval dosing of nivolumab or pembrolizumab in locally advanced or metastatic cancers. The primary objective is to assess the noninferiority of extended interval dosing relative to standard dosing, as assessed by drug trough levels above the target concentration of 1.5 ug/ml for both nivolumab and pembrolizumab. We are also interested in alternative methods of drug delivery and/or drug formulations. Enzalutamide is an established standard-of-care treatment for advanced prostate cancer with a commercially available formulation that may be inconvenient for some patients. We proposed a study to evaluate the bioequivalence of a liquid formulation to provide an alternative method of administration. This was a single-dose, randomized, open-label, two-way crossover pilot bioequivalence study to compare two oral formulations of enzalutamide: four enzalutamide 40 mg liquid-filled soft-gelatin capsules (commercially available) administered whole versus enzalutamide 160 mg liquid (extracted from capsules) administered via oral syringe. To assess bioequivalence, patients were randomized to receive a single dose of one formulation, then cross over to receive the alternative formulation following a 42-day washout period. The study did not meet proposed accrual, with only one patient enrolled, thus limiting the bioequivalence evaluation. Although both formulations appeared well tolerated with no adverse events reported, the tolerability assessment questionnaire revealed an unpleasant taste of the liquid formulation. Preliminary evidence suggests a similar pharmacokinetic profile when administering liquid extracted from enzalutamide soft-gelatin capsules compared with intact capsules in patients with prostate cancer. Tolerability may limit use in clinical practice. The CPP participates in several preclinical pharmacology projects in order to study drug metabolism, PK, drug formulation and bioavailability, as well as efficacy in preclinical models of drug development to allow for more accurate dosing estimates for future first-in-human studies. The CPP has validated assays and conducted PK analysis for the following compounds: 3-deazaneplanocin (DZ-Nep), PV1162, schweinfurthin G, englerin A, aza-englerin, XZ-419, aurora kinase A/B inhibitor SCH-1473759, and a long-acting prodrug of talazoparib.

The first class of analogs are modified at the esters to improve stability and oral bioavailability, while the second class of analogs are modified on the bridgehead of the seven-membered ring within the main englerin body of the compound. Replacement of the isopropyl group by other, larger substituents yielded compounds which displayed excellent selectivity and potency comparable to the natural product. Selected compounds were also evaluated for their effect on the ion channel TRPC4 and for intravenous toxicity in mice, and these had lower potency in both assays compared to englerin A.

AB  - Objective To evaluate the safety and tolerance of sequential thoracic radiotherapy combined with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) after induction systemic therapy.Methods ES-SCLC patients from a phase I trial and a real-world study were enrolled for those who received thoracic radiotherapy after induction systemic treatment (chemotherapy/chemotherapy combined with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors) and consolidated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors.These two studies were both approved by the Ethics Committee of Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Cancer Hospital (Clinical Trials,gov number,NCT03971214,NCT04947774).Results Between January 2019 and March 2021,a total of 11 patients with ES-SCLC were analyzed,aged 52-73 years,with a median age of 62 years.Among them,five patients (45.5%) received induction chemotherapy and six patients (54.5%) received chemotherapy combined with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor,and then all received intensity-modulated thoracic radiotherapy after evaluation of systemic treatment efficacy.Two patients developed treatment-related grade G3-5 toxicity (18.2%,1 treatment-related pneumonitis and 1 radiation esophagitis).G1-G2 hematologic toxicity,pneumonia,and anorexia were common mild toxicities.Only one patient (9.1%) terminated immunotherapy due to immune-related pneumonitis.During a median follow-up time of 12.5 months (range:3.5-16.4 months),the median disease progression-free survival and overall survival was 7.4 months (95%CI:6.9-8.0 months) and 14.6 months (95%CI:9.0-20.2 months),respectively.Conclusions Sequential thoracic radiotherapy followed by PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor is safe and feasible in patients with ES-SCLC after induction therapy.Given that both thoracic radiotherapy and immunotherapy benefits the ES-SCLC in survival,this comprehensive treatment modality warrants further investigation.

AB  - Immune checkpoint inhibitors have recently been demonstrated to improve survival in metastatic and locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Radiation therapy has a well-established role in the treatment of NSCLC and has more recently been shown to be immunostimulatory, with the potential to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy. This comprehensive review details the current roles of radiation therapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors in NSCLC, discusses the intersection of these two modalities and their potential to have combined synergistic responses, and highlights existing preclinical and clinical data and ongoing clinical trials of combined immunotherapy and radiotherapy across all NSCLC stages.

TI  - Potential benefits of volumetric modulated arc therapy to reduce the incidence of ≥ grade 2 radiation pneumonitis in radiotherapy for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients
T2  - JAPANESE JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The use of volumetric modulated arc therapy is gradually widespread for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer. The purpose of this study was to identify the factors that caused >= grade 2 radiation pneumonitis and evaluate the impact of using volumetric modulated arc therapy on the incidence of >= grade 2 radiation pneumonitis by comparing three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy.Methods: We retrospectively evaluated 124 patients who underwent radical radiotherapy for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer in our institution between 2008 and 2019. The following variables were analysed to detect the factors that affected >= grade 2 radiation pneumonitis; age, sex, the presence of interstitial lung disease, pulmonary emphysema, tumour location, stage, PTV/lung volume, lung V-20Gy, total dose, concurrent chemoradiotherapy, adjuvant immune checkpoint inhibitor, radiotherapy method. Radiation pneumonitis was evaluated using the common terminology criteria for adverse events (version 5.0).Results: A total of 84 patients underwent three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT group) and 40 patients underwent volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT group). The cumulative incidence of >= grade 2 radiation pneumonitis at 12 months was significantly lower in the VMAT group than in the 3D-CRT group (25% vs. 49.1%). The use of volumetric modulated arc therapy was a significant factor for >= grade 2 radiation pneumonitis (HR:0.32, 95% CI: 0.15-0.65, P = 0.0017) in addition to lung V-20Gy (>= 24%, HR:5.72 (95% CI: 2.87-11.4), P < 0.0001) and total dose (>= 70 Gy, HR:2.64 (95% CI: 1.39-5.03), P = 0.0031) even after adjustment by multivariate analysis.Conclusions: We identified factors associated with >= grade 2 radiation pneumonitis in radiotherapy for patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Volumetric modulated arc therapy has potential benefits to reduce the risk of >= grade 2 radiation pneumonitis.

TI  - Prolonging Survival: The Role of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in the Treatment ofExtensive-StageSmall Cell Lung Cancer
T2  - ONCOLOGIST
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) represents approximately 15% of lung cancers, and approximately 70% are diagnosed as extensive-stage SCLC (ES-SCLC). Although ES-SCLC is highly responsive to chemotherapy, patients typically progress rapidly, and there is an urgent need for new therapies. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have recently been investigated in SCLC, and this review provides guidance on the use of these agents in ES-SCLC based on phase III evidence. Methods Published and presented literature on phase III data addressing use of ICIs in ES-SCLC was identified using the key search terms "small cell lung cancer" AND "checkpoint inhibitors" (OR respective aliases). Directed searches of eligible studies were periodically performed to ensure capture of the most recent data. Results Six phase III trials were identified, with four assessing the benefits of ICIs plus chemotherapy first-line, one evaluating ICIs as first-line therapy maintenance, and one assessing ICI monotherapy after progression on platinum-based chemotherapy. The addition of ipilimumab or tremelimumab to first-line treatment or as first-line maintenance did not improve survival. Two out of three studies combining PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors with first-line platinum-based chemotherapy demonstrated significant long-lasting survival benefits and improved quality of life with no unexpected safety concerns. PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors as first-line maintenance or in later lines of therapy did not improve survival. Biomarker research is ongoing as well as research into the role of ICIs in combination with radiation therapy in limited-stage SCLC. Conclusion The addition of atezolizumab or durvalumab to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy for ES-SCLC prolongs survival and improves quality of life. Implications for Practice Platinum-based chemotherapy has been standard of care for extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) for more than a decade. Six recent phase III trials investigating immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have clarified the role of these agents in this setting. Although ICIs were assessed first-line, as first-line maintenance, and in later lines of therapy, the additions of atezolizumab or durvalumab to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy were the only interventions that significantly improved overall survival and increased quality of life. These combinations should therefore be considered standard therapy for first-line ES-SCLC. Biomarker research and investigations into the role of ICIs for limited-stage disease are ongoing.

AB  - Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive neuroendocrine tumor characterized by early metastatic spread and responsiveness to initial therapy. The incidence of SCLC has been declining in the United States in parallel with the decreasing prevalence of cigarette smoking. Limited stage disease is potentially curable with chemoradiotherapy followed by cranial irradiation. Extensive stage disease is incurable, but systemic chemotherapy can improve quality of life and prolong survival. Nearly all patients relapse with chemoresistant disease. Molecularly targeted therapy has failed to yield convincing clinical benefits. Nevertheless, many biologically rational strategies, including immune checkpoint inhibition, show promise in ongoing clinical trials.

TI  - Thoracic radiotherapy in small cell lung cancer-a narrative review
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL LUNG CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) represents 10?15% of all lung cancers and has a poor prognosis. Thoracic radiotherapy plays a central role in current SCLC management. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CTRT) is the standard of care for localised disease (stage I?III, limited-stage, LS). Definitive thoracic radiotherapy may be offered in metastatic patients (stage IV, extensive stage, ES-SCLC) after chemotherapy. For LS-SCLC, the gold standard is early accelerated hyperfractionated twice-daily CTRT (4 cycles of cisplatin etoposide, starting with the first or second chemotherapy cycle). Modern radiation techniques should be used with involved-field radiotherapy based on baseline CT and PET/CT scans. In ES-SCLC, thoracic radiotherapy should be discussed in cases of initial bulky mediastinal disease/residual thoracic disease not progressing after induction chemotherapy. This strategy was however not assessed in recent trials establishing chemo-immunotherapy as the standard first line treatment in ES-SCLC. Future developments include technical radiotherapy advances and the incorporation of new drugs. Thoracic irradiation is delivered more precisely given technical developments (IMRT, image-guided radiotherapy, stereotactic radiotherapy), reducing the risks of severe adverse events. Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy may be discussed in rare early stage (T1 to 2, N0) inoperable patients. A number of current clinical trials are investigating immunoradiotherapy. In this review, we highlight the current role of thoracic radiotherapy and describe ongoing research in the integration of biological surrogate markers, advanced radiotherapy technologies and novel drugs in SCLC patients.

TI  - Radiation therapy for extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer in the era of immunotherapy
T2  - CANCER LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Unlike non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the progression of small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is slow. Extensivestage SCLC (ES-SCLC) is a serious threat to human health, with a 5-year survival rate of <7%. Chemotherapy has been the first-line treatment for the past 30 years. The anti-PD-L1 checkpoint blockades durvalumab and atezolizumab have greatly prolonged overall survival and have become the standard first-line therapy for ES-SCLC since the CASPIAN and IMpower133 trials. In the era of chemotherapy, radiation therapy (RT), including thoracic radiation therapy (TRT) and brain radiation therapy (BRT), has shown clinical effects in randomized and retrospective studies on ES-SCLC. RT-immunotherapy has shown exciting synergistic effects in NSCLC. For ESSCLC, the clinical effects of combining TRT/BRT with immunotherapy have not yet been systematically explored. In this review, we found that studies on RT-immunotherapy in ES-SCLC are relatively few and limited to early phase studies focusing on toxicity. The efficacy and safety profiles of early phase studies encourage prospective clinical trials. In this review, we discuss the best population, optimum TRT dose, proper TRT time, and strategies for reducing radiation-induced neurotoxicity. Furthermore, we suggest that biomarkers and patient performance status should be fully assessed before RT-immunotherapy treatment. Prospective trials are needed to provide more evidence for RT-immunotherapy applications in ES-SCLC.

TI  - The efficiency and safety of immune checkpoint inhibitors in the treatment of small cell lung cancer: a meta-analysis
T2  - ANNALS OF PALLIATIVE MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is highly invasive and fatal, sensitive to chemotherapy and radiotherapy but prone to relapse, with a poor overall survival rate. It is particularly urgent for SCLC patients to receive effective follow-up treatment. In the past 20 years, there has been no breakthrough in clinical treatment of SCLC. Currently, clinical studies on immunotherapy for SCLC with extensive stage disease (ED) have achieved good efficacy, bringing new hope for the treatment of small-cell lung cancer. PD-1 inhibitors used to treat small cell lung cancer include Pembrolizumab and Nivolumab. PD-L1 inhibitors mainly include Atezolizumab and Durvalumab. Other PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, such as Avelumab, are currently being tried for SCLC and the results have not yet been published. This study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of immunotherapy in patients with ED SCLC.Methods: A literature search of the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were performed. Two reviewers independently screened the literature, extracted the data, and evaluated the risk of bias of the included studies. RevMan 5.3 software was used for meta-analysis.Results: Four studies involving 1,981 patients with ED SCLC were included. Both overall survival (OS) [hazard ratio (HR)=0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) (0.68, 0.95), P=0.009] and progression-free survival (PFS) [HR=0.82, 95% CI (0.75, 0.90), P<0.00001] were longer in the immunotherapy group than in the chemotherapy group. The incidence of total treatment-related adverse events in the immunotherapy group were lower than those in the chemotherapy group [relative risk (RR)=1.050, 95% CI (1.010, 1.080), P=0.007], and the differences were statistically significant.Conclusions: Immunotherapy has better efficacy and safety than chemotherapy for the treatment of ED SCLC.

TI  - Feasibility of intensity modulated radiotherapy with involved field radiotherapy for Japanese patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF RADIATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The feasibility of intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) with involved field radiotherapy (IFRT) for Japanese patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC) remains unclear. Here we reviewed our initial experience of IMRT with IFRT for Japanese patients with LA-NSCLC to evaluate the feasibility of the treatment. Twenty LA-NSCLC patients who were treated with IMRT with IFRT during November 2019 to October 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. All patients received 60 Gy in 30 fractions of IMRT and were administered concurrent platinum-based chemotherapy. The median patient age was 71 years old and the group included 15 men and 5 women. The patient group included 2 patients with stage IIB, 11 patients with stage IIIA, 5 patients with stage IIIB, and 2 patients with stage IIIC disease. Histological diagnosis was squamous cell carcinoma in 14 patients, adenocarcinoma in 5 patients, and non-small cell lung cancer in 1 patient. The median follow-up period was 8 months. The incidence of grade 3 or greater pneumonitis was 5%, and grade 3 or greater esophagitis was not observed. None of the patients developed regional lymph node, with only recurrence reported so far. These findings indicate that IMRT with IFRT for Japanese patients with LA-NSCLC is feasible in terms of acute toxicity. Further study with a larger number of patients and longer follow-up to clarify the effect of treatment on patient prognosis is required.

TI  - Anti-PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors in combination with etoposide and platinum for extensive-stage small cell lung cancer: a case report
T2  - ANNALS OF PALLIATIVE MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The conventional etoposide-platinum (EP) regimen and adjuvant radiotherapy remain the gold-standard treatment for small cell lung cancer (SCLC). However, most patients already have multiple metastases when they are first diagnosed with SCLC. The objective response rate (ORR) and 1-year survival rate are low in these patients despite active radiotherapy and chemotherapy. SCLC is oncologically featured by the high tumor mutational burden (TMB) of multiple genes, which makes immunotherapy a possible new treatment strategy for SCLC. New data from the IMpower 133 and CASPIAN trials will shed new light on the treatment of SCLC. In 2020, the results from the phase 3 CASPIAN trial have already suggested that programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors may represent breakthroughs in the management of SCLC. Here, we report a patient with extensive-stage SCLC (ES-SCLC) treated with first-line anti- PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitor (PD-L1 inhibitor) (i.e., durvalumab) combined with the EP regimen for 6 cycles. The patient consistently achieved partial response (PR) [nearly complete response (CR)], and no immune-related adverse events were noted during this period. The Karnofsky performance status (PS) score maintained at 1-2 points. We further review the history of SCLC treatment and elucidate the role of combination with immunotherapy in treating SCLC in the coming years.

TI  - Radiotherapy for extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer in the immunotherapy era
T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Currently, chemoimmunotherapy is the first-line treatment for extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). However, only 0.8%-2.5% of the patients presented complete response after chemoimmunotherapy. Considering that ES-SCLC is highly sensitive to radiotherapy, the addition of radiotherapy after first-line treatment for ES-SCLC could further improve local control, which may be beneficial for patients' survival. Prior studies have shown that consolidative thoracic radiotherapy (cTRT) can decrease disease progression and improve overall survival in patients with ES-SCLC who respond well to chemotherapy. However, the efficacy and safety of cTRT in the immunotherapy era remain unclear owing to a lack of prospective studies. Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) has been shown to decrease brain metastasis (BM) and prolong survival in patients with limited-stage SCLC in previous reports. However, according to current guidelines, PCI is not commonly recommended for ES-SCLC. Immunotherapy has the potential to reduce the incidence of BM. Whether PCI can be replaced with regular magnetic resonance imaging surveillance for ES-SCLC in the era of immunotherapy remains controversial. Whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) is the standard treatment for BM in SCLC patients. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has shown promise in the treatment of limited BM. Considering the potential of immunotherapy to decrease BM, it is controversial whether SRS can replace WBRT for limited BM in the immunotherapy era. Additionally, with the addition of immunotherapy, the role of palliative radiotherapy may be weakened in patients with asymptomatic metastatic lesions. However, it is still indispensable and urgent for patients with obvious symptoms of metastatic disease, such as spinal cord compression, superior vena cava syndrome, lobar obstruction, and weight-bearing metastases, which may critically damage the quality of life and prognosis. To improve the outcome of ES-SCLC, we discuss the feasibility of radiotherapy, including cTRT, PCI, WBRT/SRS, and palliative radiotherapy with immunotherapy based on existing evidence, which may offer specific prospects for further randomized trials and clinical applications.

TI  - Tackling the current dilemma of immunotherapy in extensive-stage small cell lung cancer: A promising strategy of combining with radiotherapy
T2  - CANCER LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Progress in the treatment of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) has been modest over the past decades until the advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors, which have redefined the standard first-line treatment for extensive-stage SCLC (ES-SCLC). However, despite the positive results of several clinical trials, the limited survival benefit achieved suggests that the priming and sustaining of immunotherapeutic efficacy are poor and further investigation is urgently needed. In this review, we aim to summarize the potential mechanisms underlying the limited efficacy of immunotherapy and intrinsic resistance in ES-SCLC, including impaired antigen presentation and limited T cell infiltration. Moreover, to tackle the current dilemma, given the synergistic effects of radiotherapy on immunotherapy, especially the unique advantages of low-dose radiotherapy (LDRT), such as less immunosup-pression and lower radiation toxicity, we propose radiotherapy as a booster to enhance the immunotherapeutic efficacy by overcoming the poor priming effect. Recent clinical trials, including ours, have also focused on adding radiotherapy, including LDRT, to first-line treatment of ES-SCLC. Additionally, we also suggest combination strategies to sustain the immunostimulatory effect of radiotherapy, as well as the cancer-immunity cycle, and further improve survival outcomes.

TI  - Chemoradioimmunotherapy of inoperable stage III non-small cell lung cancer: immunological rationale and current clinical trials establishing a novel multimodal strategy
T2  - RADIATION ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have dramatically changed the landscape of lung cancer treatment. Preclinical studies investigating combination of ICI with radiation show a synergistic improvement of tumor control probability and have resulted in the development of novel therapeutic strategies. For advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), targeting immune checkpoint pathways has proven to be less toxic with more durable treatment response than conventional chemotherapy. In inoperable Stage III NSCLC, consolidation immune checkpoint inhibition with the PD-L1 inhibitor durvalumab after completion of concurrent platinum-based chemoradiotherapy resulted in remarkable improvement of progression-free and overall survival. This new tri-modal therapy has become a new treatment standard. Development of predictive biomarkers and improvement of patient selection and monitoring is the next step in order to identify patients most likely to derive maximal benefit from this new multimodal approach. In this review, we discuss the immunological rationale and current trials investigating chemoradioimmunotherapy for inoperable stage III NSCLC.

M3  - Review
AB  - Brain metastases (BrM) are common in both non-small-cell lung cancer and small-cell lung cancer. Substantial progress in BrM management has occurred in the past decade related to advances in both radiation and medical oncology. Recent and ongoing radiation trials have focused on increasing the candidacy for focal therapy of BrM with stereotactic radiosurgery; reducing the toxicity and improving patient selection for whole brain radiotherapy; and, in small-cell lung cancer, evaluating brain magnetic resonance imaging surveillance without prophylactic cranial irradiation, hippocampal avoidance in prophylactic cranial irradiation and whole brain radiotherapy, and the role of upfront stereotactic radiosurgery for BrM. In medical oncology, the development of multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitors with encouraging CNS activity and emerging data on the CNS activity of immune checkpoint inhibitors in some patients have opened the door to novel systemic and multidisciplinary treatment strategies for the management of BrM. Future research will focus on more robust characterizations of the CNS activity of targeted therapy and immunotherapies, as well as optimal integration and patient selection for multidisciplinary strategies involving CNS-active drugs, radiation therapy, and CNS surveillance.

In fact, the standard treatment regimen for limited stage SCLC has not appreciably shifted in more than 20 years, consisting of four to six cycles of cisplatin and etoposide chemotherapy concurrent with thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) followed by prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) for responsive disease. Nevertheless, long-term outcomes have improved with median survival approaching 25-30 months, and approximately one third of patients now survive 5 years. This is likely attributable in part to improvements in staging, including use of brain magnetic resonance imaging and fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography imaging, advances in radiation treatment planning, and supportive care. The CONVERT and CALGB 30610 phase III trials failed to demonstrate a survival advantage for high-dose, once-daily TRT compared with standard 45 Gy twice-daily TRT, although high-dose, once-daily TRT remains common in practice. A phase III comparison of high-dose 60 Gy twice-daily TRT versus 45 Gy twice-daily TRT aims to confirm the provocative outcomes reported with 60 Gy twice daily in the phase II setting. Efforts over time have shifted from intensifying PCI, to attempting to reduce treatment-related neurotoxicity, to more recently questioning whether careful magnetic resonance imaging surveillance may obviate the routine need for PCI. The addition of immunotherapy has resulted in mixed success in extensive-stage SCLC with modest benefit observed with programmed death-ligand 1 inhibitors, and several ongoing trials assess programmed death-ligand 1 inhibition concurrent or adjuvant to chemoradiotherapy in limited-stage SCLC. Major advances in future treatment will likely depend on a better understanding and exploiting of molecular characteristics of SCLC with increasing personalization of therapy.

T2  - JOURNAL OF HEMATOLOGY & ONCOLOGY
M3  - Letter
AB  - The life expectancy of extensive-stage small cell lung (ES-SCLC) cancer patients has not improved in the last 2-3 decades until two recent trials (CASPIAN and IMpower133) showing the addition of anti-programmed death ligand (PD-L1) therapy to chemotherapy has survival benefit over chemotherapy alone. However, such benefit is relatively small and was not even observed in some other trials using immunotherapy, raising the question of optimal chemoimmunotherapy combination in the 1st-line setting for ES-SCLC. Here, we discussed several thought-provoking questions with the focus on IMpower133 and CASPIAN trials.

TI  - Durable Response to Atezolizumab in Extensive-Stage Small-Cell Lung Cancer Leading to 60 Months Overall Survival: A Case Report
T2  - CURRENT ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) remains a disease with poor prognosis, particularly in extensive-stage SCLC (ES-SCLC). Current standard-of-care treatment includes chemotherapy with platinum agents and etoposide plus immunotherapy with atezolizumab or durvalumab, which has achieved a mean overall survival of 12-13 months in clinical trials. However, long-term survival in ES-SCLC, even with the addition of immunotherapy, continues to be rare. We present the case of a middle-aged male patient diagnosed with ES-SCLC who was treated with four cycles of induction chemotherapy (carboplatin and etoposide) and atezolizumab, starting maintenance atezolizumab every 21 days thereafter, and thoracic radiotherapy. After 9 months, he experienced mild disease progression and was rechallenged with six cycles of carboplatin and etoposide with continued atezolizumab. Subsequent imaging showed near-complete disease resolution which has been sustained since. He has continued on maintenance atezolizumab since diagnosis and has achieved 60 months overall survival and 44 months progression-free survival. Throughout treatment, he has maintained a high functional capacity and only experienced one immune-related adverse event. Our patient is representative of a small subset who are capable of achieving durable responses to immunotherapy and his case highlights the need for further research to elucidate the clinical and biological factors driving this response.

M3  - Review
AB  - Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a type of neuroendocrine neoplasms with high aggressiveness and poor prognosis. Chemotherapy has been the standard first-line therapy for SCLC over the past several decades. In recent years, results of randomized phase III CASPIAN and IMpower-133 trials indicated that the combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) with platinum-etoposide chemotherapy improved the overall survival (OS) of patients with extensive stage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC), which has transformed the treatment model for ES-SCLC. ICIs combined with chemotherapy has become the new first-line standard treatment of ES-SCLC with the latest research results from CASPIAN and ASTRUM-005 studies. This review summarizes the recent progress of ICIs in the treatment of ES-SCLC and expounds the mode and efficacy of immunotherapy for ES-SCLC. Future research focused on exploring basic SCLC biology and identifying novel predictive biomarkers in response to ICIs in ES-SCLC is essential. Double-ICIs treatment strategies, bispecific antibodies, and ICIs combined with other therapies, such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and targeted therapy, represent a new modality and show great promise for the treatment of ES-SCLC, which should achieve greater therapeutic effects through multiple synergistic mechanisms.

TI  - Is there role of adjuvant radiotherapy after complete resection of locally advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer?
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of reviewThis review aims to provide a timely and relevant overview of the role of postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) in completely resected stage IIIA-N2 nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Given the controversy surrounding the use of PORT and the emergence of advanced radiation techniques and therapies, this review provides valuable insight into current and potential treatment strategies.Recent findingsThe Lung ART and PORT-C trials have provided valuable insights into the efficacy of PORT in stage IIIA-N2 NSCLC. While the results have been mixed, studies have shown that advanced radiation techniques, such as intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and proton therapy, can reduce cardiopulmonary toxicities associated with PORT. Molecular targeted therapies and immunotherapies have also shown potential in improving NSCLC treatment outcomes.SummaryThe role of radiotherapy becomes smaller and smaller in new era. However, it is too early to abolish radiotherapy for all the patients after complete resection of locally advanced NSCLC. Nowadays, it is recommended to adopt individualized treatment approaches guided by multidisciplinary team consultations. The integration of IMRT, proton therapy, and emerging therapies offers the potential to enhance treatment efficacy while minimizing toxicity. Further research is needed to optimize the use of PORT and explore the method to identify the patients who can really benefit from PORT.

M3  - Review
AB  - From radiation therapy and surgery to chemotherapy and targeted therapy, the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has remarkably evolved over the past few decades. In recent years, immunotherapy has become an increasingly attractive area of interest in the treatment of NSCLC, especially those in advanced stages. Cytokine and immune checkpoint inhibitors are among the most studied immunotherapies for many cancer types. Herein, we provide an overview of current popular cytokine and checkpoint inhibitor treatment regimens available for patients with NSCLC. Ongoing clinic trials and novel molecular targets that are discussed here could lead to promising new treatment options for NSCLC. The evidence summarized in this review might be helpful for clinicians to better manage patients with NSCLC.

TI  - Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors and Chemoradiation for Limited-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer
T2  - CURRENT TREATMENT OPTIONS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Opinion statement Limited-stage small cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC) is a potentially curable disease. However, most patients develop disease relapse shortly after definitive treatment. The landmark trials IMpower133 and CASPIAN demonstrated a survival benefit with the addition of immunotherapy to first-line platinum/etoposide for extensive-stage small cell lung cancer. Therefore, it is critical to determine whether advancements in overall survival with immunotherapy can be translated earlier into the treatment paradigm for LS-SCLC. Decades of robust preclinical research into the synergism of radiation therapy and immunotherapy set the stage for the combination of these treatment modalities. Recently published data suggests tolerability of single agent immunotherapy concurrent with chemoradiation in LS-SCLC, along with promising efficacy. However, combination immunotherapy in the consolidation setting appears too toxic, although this may be reflective of the dosing schedule rather than inherent to any combination immune checkpoint blockade. Here, we review underlying mechanisms of synergy with the combination of radiation and immunotherapy, the safety and efficacy of respective treatment modalities, and the ongoing trials that are exploring novel therapeutic approaches for LS-SCLC. Pivotal trials in LS-SCLC are ongoing and anticipated to aid in understanding efficacy and safety of immunotherapy with concurrent platinum-based chemoradiotherapy.

TI  - Safety and tolerability of stereotactic radiotherapy combined with durvalumab with or without tremelimumab in advanced non-small cell lung cancer, the phase I SICI trial
T2  - LUNG CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: This phase I study primarily addresses the safety and tolerability of Stereotactic radiotherapy on the primary tumor combined with double Immune Checkpoint Inhibition (SICI) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Increasing the release of neoantigens by radiotherapy might enhance response to immunotherapy. Especially, by targeting trunk mutations in the primary tumor. Materials and Methods: In three sequential cohorts, immunotherapy regimes combined with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) on the primary tumor (1x20 Gy on 9 cc) were studied in stage IIIB/IV NSCLC patients progressing on chemotherapy. The first cohort (n = 3) received durvalumab. The second (n = 6) received a combination of tremelimumab and durvalumab followed by durvalumab monotherapy. The third cohort (n = 6) was similar except that the combination was reversed. Descriptive statistics were used to assess safety parameters and the exploratory outcomes of efficacy. Adverse events were reported using NCI CTCAE version 4.03. Exhaled breath was analyzed at baseline. Results: Fifteen patients were included. Median irradiated volume was 9.13 cc, on a median primary tumor volume of 79 cc. There were seven patients with grade 1-2, and two patients with grade 3 treatment related adverse events. There was 1 dose limiting toxicity (colitis) with double immunotherapy. Conclusion: The combination of SBRT to the primary tumor and double immunotherapy in advanced NSCLC patients is safe and feasible.

M3  - Article
AB  - The immunotherapy combined chemotherapy has been the standard treatment strategy for extensive-stage small lung cancer (ES-SCLC). The CREST trial reported consolidative thoracic radiotherapy (cTRT) improved overall survival (OS) for ES-SCLC with intrathoracic residual after chemotherapy. In this study, patients with ES-SCLC who received immunotherapy were assigned to receive either TRT or no TRT. TRT significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS), local recurrence-free survival (LRFS) and OS with well tolerated toxicity. Further sub-cohort analysis, TRT significantly improved LRFS in patients with oligo-metastasis and without liver metastasis.

TI  - PD-1/PD-L1 Blockade Therapy in Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer: Current Status and Future Directions
T2  - ONCOLOGIST
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has become one of the most promising approaches in the field of cancer therapy. Unlike the current therapies that target tumor cells, such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or targeted therapy, ICIs directly restore the exhausted host antitumor immune responses mediated by the tumors. Among multiple immune modulators identified, the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death protein ligand 1 (PD-L1) axis leading to the exhaustion of T-cell immunity in chronic infections and tumors has been widely investigated. Therefore, blocking antibodies targeting PD-1 or PD-L1 have been developed and approved for the treatment of various advanced cancers, including non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), making them the most successful ICIs. Compared with chemotherapy or radiotherapy, PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy significantly improves the durable response rate and prolongs long-term survival with limited adverse effects in both monotherapy and combination therapy for advanced NSCLC. However, extensive challenges exist for further clinical applications, such as a small fraction of benefit population, primary and acquired resistance, the lack of predictive and prognostic biomarkers, and treatment-related adverse effects. In this article, we summarize the latest clinical applications of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy in advanced NSCLC worldwide, as well as in China, and discuss the bottlenecks related to the use of this therapy in clinical practice. An exploration of the underlying mechanism of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy and biomarker identification will maximize the application of ICIs in advanced NSCLC and facilitate bedside-to-bench studies in cancer immunotherapy as well.

AB  - Advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains a high unmet medical need. The first line standard-of care therapy comprises concurrent chemotherapy-immunotherapy with pembrolizumab. Concurrent irradiation with pembrolizumab has been shown to significantly improve survival benefit compared with immunotherapy alone in a pooled analysis of 2 randomized phase 2 trials. We present the rationale and study design of the ???PD-1 iNhibitor and chemotherapy with concurrent IRradiation at VAried tumor sites in advanced Non-small cell lung cAncer??? (NIRVANA Lung) tr ial (ClinicalTr ials.gov identifier, NCT03774732). This study is a national multicenter 1:1 randomized phase III trial testing in 460 patients, the addition of multisite radiotherapy in advanced NSCLC treated with standard immune checkpoint inhibitors (pembrolizumab)-chemotherapy in first line. The pr imary objective of the tr ial is to compare the overall survival between the 2 arms at year 1 of the study. The secondary objective is to compare the progression-free survival and cancer-specific survival at year 1 and 2, as well as to determine quality of life, local and distant control in irradiated and nonirradiated sites at 6 months and year 1.

TI  - Radiation and PD-1 inhibition: Favorable outcomes after brain-directed radiation
T2  - RADIOTHERAPY AND ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and purpose: Patients with metastatic melanoma, renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are increasingly treated with immune checkpoint blockade targeting the programed death (PD)-1 receptor, often with palliative radiation therapy. Outcome data are limited in this population.Material and methods: We retrospectively reviewed consecutive patients with metastatic NSCLC, melanoma, and RCC who received radiation and a nti-PD-1 therapy at four centers.Results: We identified 137 patients who received radiation and PD-1 inhibition. Median survival from first PD-1 therapy was 192, 394, and 121 days for NSCLC, melanoma, and RCC patients. Among 59 patients who received radiation following the start of PD-1 blockade, 25 continued to receive PD-1 inhibition for a median of 179 days and survived for a median of 238 additional days. Median survival following first course of radiation for brain metastases was 634 days. Melanoma patients received brain directed radiation relatively less frequently following the start of PD-1 inhibitor treatment.Conclusions: Incorporation of palliative radiation does not preclude favorable outcomes in patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors; patients irradiated after the start of PD-1 inhibition can remain on therapy and demonstrate prolonged survival. Of note, patients irradiated for brain metastases demonstrate favorable outcomes compared with historical controls. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Real-world outcomes of PD-L1 inhibitors combined with thoracic radiotherapy in the first-line treatment of extensive stage small cell lung cancer
T2  - RADIATION ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe CREST study showed that the addition of thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) could improve the survival rate in patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC), but whether TRT can bring survival benefit in the era of immunotherapy remains controversial. This study aimed to explore the efficacy and safety of adding TRT to the combination of PD-L1 inhibitors and chemotherapy.MethodsThe patients who received durvalumab or atezolizumab combined with chemotherapy as the first-line treatment of ES-SCLC from January 2019 to December 2021 were enrolled. They were divided into two groups, based on whether they received TRT or not. Propensity score matching (PSM) with a 1:1 ratio was performed. The primary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and safety.ResultsA total of 211 patients with ES-SCLC were enrolled, of whom 70 (33.2%) patients received standard therapy plus TRT as first-line treatment, and 141 (66.8%) patients in the control group received PD-L1 inhibitors plus chemotherapy. After PSM, a total of 57 pairs of patients were enrolled in the analysis. In all patients, the median PFS (mPFS) in the TRT and non-TRT group was 9.5 and 7.2 months, respectively, with HR = 0.59 (95%CI 0.39-0.88, p = 0.009). The median OS (mOS) in the TRT group was also significantly longer than that in the non-TRT group (24.1 months vs. 18.5 months, HR = 0.53, 95%CI 0.31-0.89, p = 0.016). Multivariable analysis showed that baseline liver metastasis and the number of metastases & GE; 3 were independent prognostic factors for OS. Addition of TRT increased the incidence of treatment-related pneumonia (p = 0.018), most of which were grade 1-2.ConclusionsAddition of TRT to durvalumab or atezolizumab plus chemotherapy significantly improves survival in ES-SCLC. Although it may leads to increased incidence of treatment-related pneumonia, a majority of the cases can be relieved after symptomatic treatment.

TI  - Immunotherapy and Radiation Therapy for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer-A Stimulating Partnership
T2  - SEMINARS IN RESPIRATORY AND CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common subtype of lung cancer and the leading cause of cancer-related death. Although durable local control rates are high after surgical resection or definitive radiotherapy for early-stage disease, a substantial proportion of these patients eventually experience regional and/or distant failure and succumb to their metastatic disease. The discovery of immunotherapeutics and targeted biologics has revolutionized the treatment of locally advanced and metastatic disease, improving progression-free and overall survival when incorporated with the current standards of care. Notably, post-hoc analyses and early clinical trials provide a growing body of evidence to support a synergistic effect between radiation and immunotherapy for the treatment of NSCLC from early-stage to metastatic disease. Radiotherapy appears to be capable of not only potentiating the effect of immunotherapy in targeted lesions, but also eliciting an antitumor response in distant lesions without any direct exposure to radiation. This review explores the biologic basis of immunotherapy, targeted biologics, and radiotherapy as well as the preclinical and clinical data that support the combined use of radioimmunotherapy for early-stage, locally advanced, and metastatic NSCLC.

TI  - Immunotherapeutics in lung cancers: from mechanistic insight to clinical implications and synergistic perspectives
T2  - MOLECULAR BIOLOGY REPORTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Background Lung cancer is one of the highly lethal forms of cancer whose incidence has worldwide rapidly increased over the past few decades. About 80-85% of all lung cancer cases constitute non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and large cell carcinoma as the main subtypes. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have led to significant advances in the treatment of a variety of solid tumors, significantly improving cancer patient survival rates.Methods and Results The cytotoxic drugs in combination with anti-PD-(L)1 antibodies is a new method that aims to reduce the activation of immunosuppressive and cancer cell prosurvival responses while also improving direct cancer cell death. The most commonly utilized immune checkpoint inhibitors for patients with non-small cell lung cancer are monoclonal antibodies (Atezolizumab, Cemiplimab, Ipilimumab, Pembrolizumab etc.) against PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4. Among them, Atezolizumab (TECENTRIQ) and Cemiplimab (Libtayo) are engineered monoclonal anti programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibodies that inhibit binding of PD-L1 to PD-1 and B7.1. As a result, T-cell proliferation and cytokine synthesis are inhibited leading to restoring the immune homeostasis to fight cancer cells.Conclusions In this review article, the path leading to the introduction of immunotherapeutic options in lung cancer treatment is described, with analyzing the benefits and shortages of the current immunotherapeutic drugs. In addition, possibilities to co-administer immunotherapeutic agents with standard cancer treatment modalities are also considered.

TI  - Central nervous system metastases in advanced non-small cell lung cancer: A review of the therapeutic landscape
T2  - CANCER TREATMENT REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - Up to 40% of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) develop central nervous system (CNS) metastases. Current treatments for this subgroup of patients with advanced NSCLC include local therapies (surgery, stereotactic radiosurgery, and, less frequently, whole-brain radiotherapy), targeted therapies for oncogene-addicted NSCLC (small molecules, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and antibody-drug conjugates), and immune checkpoint inhibitors (as monotherapy or combination therapy), with multiple new drugs in development. However, confirming the intracranial activity of these treatments has proven to be challenging, given that most lung cancer clinical trials exclude patients with untreated and/or progressing CNS metastases, or do not include prespecified CNS-related endpoints. Here we review progress in the treatment of patients with CNS metastases originating from NSCLC, examining local treatment options, systemic therapies, and multimodal therapeutic strategies. We also consider challenges regarding assessment of treatment response and provide thoughts around future directions for managing CNS disease in patients with advanced NSCLC.

TI  - Lung cancer immunotherapy: progress, pitfalls, and promises
T2  - MOLECULAR CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - Lung cancer is the primary cause of mortality in the United States and around the globe. Therapeutic options for lung cancer treatment include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and targeted drug therapy. Medical management is often associated with the development of treatment resistance leading to relapse. Immunotherapy is profoundly altering the approach to cancer treatment owing to its tolerable safety profile, sustained therapeutic response due to immunological memory generation, and effectiveness across a broad patient population. Different tumor-specific vaccination strategies are gaining ground in the treatment of lung cancer. Recent advances in adoptive cell therapy (CAR T, TCR, TIL), the associated clinical trials on lung cancer, and associated hurdles are discussed in this review. Recent trials on lung cancer patients (without a targetable oncogenic driver alteration) reveal significant and sustained responses when treated with programmed death-1/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) checkpoint blockade immunotherapies. Accumulating evidence indicates that a loss of effective anti-tumor immunity is associated with lung tumor evolution. Therapeutic cancer vaccines combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) can achieve better therapeutic effects. To this end, the present article encompasses a detailed overview of the recent developments in the immunotherapeutic landscape in targeting small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Additionally, the review also explores the implication of nanomedicine in lung cancer immunotherapy as well as the combinatorial application of traditional therapy along with immunotherapy regimens. Finally, ongoing clinical trials, significant obstacles, and the future outlook of this treatment strategy are also highlighted to boost further research in the field.

TI  - The role of thoracic consolidative radiotherapy in the setting of immunotherapy in extensive stage small cell lung cancer
T2  - THERAPEUTIC ADVANCES IN MEDICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The improvement in treatment strategies and outcomes in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) has lagged behind other cancers. The addition of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), durvalumab and atezolizumab, to the platinum-based chemotherapy in frontline setting has improved the survival in extensive stage SCLC, (ES-SCLC), albeit modestly, and is now the new standard of care. Prior to advent of immunotherapy into the therapeutic armamentarium in ES-SCLC, consolidative thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) was associated with improved thoracic control and survival outcomes. In the era of ICIs, the role of TRT is not well defined, chiefly because TRT was not incorporated in any immunotherapy trials, secondly due to concerns regarding the increased risks of pneumonitis, and finally uncertain magnitude of benefit with this combined approach. In principle, radiation can increase in the immunogenicity of tumor and hence the activity of immune checkpoint blockade, thereby increasing efficacy both locally and distantly. Such an approach has been promising in non-small cell lung cancer with ICIs improving outcomes after concurrent chemoradiation, but remains unanswered in ES-SCLC. It is, thus, possible that the modest improvement in survival by addition of ICIs to chemotherapy in ES-SCLC can be further improved by the incorporation of consolidative TRT in selected patients. Several early phase trials and retrospective studies have suggested that such an approach may be feasible and safe. Prospective trials are ongoing to answer whether adding radiation therapy to chemoimmunotherapy will improve outcomes in ES-SCLC.

M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with unresectable stage III non-small-cell lung cancer constitute a heterogeneous group in which the available treatments may range from radical therapies with radio-chemotherapy to supportive treatments depending on the extent of the disease and comorbidities present. For years the standard treatment based on the combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy (RT) has remained unchanged and survival outcomes have been poor.AIM: Recent advances in molecular biology and RT technology have resulted in improved survival. This article reviews the treatments that constitute current standard treatment in unresectable advanced lung cancer and the situations and indications for the management of patients who are not candidates for radical therapy.RELEVANCE FOR PATIENTS: Although unresectable lung cancer does not have a good prognosis, new drugs and new technologies in radiation oncology can offer treatment options adapted to the patient's clinical situation, ranging from therapies administered with radical intent to others aimed mainly at improving the patient's quality of life, which, judiciously chosen, will provide optimal management of the patient.

TI  - Full Dose SBRT in Combination With Mediastinal Chemoradiation for Locally Advanced, Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Practical Guide for Planning, Dosimetric Results From a Phase 2 Study, and a Treatment Planning Guide for the Phase 3 NRG Oncology LU-008 Trial

AB  - Purpose: Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) has been used with high effectiveness in early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) but has not been studied extensively in locally advanced NSCLC. We conducted a phase 2 study delivering SBRT to the pri-mary tumor followed by conventionally fractionated chemoradiation to the involved lymph nodes for patients with node-positive locally advanced NSCLC. This manuscript serves as both a guide to planning techniques used on this trial and the subsequent phase 3 study, NRG Oncology LU-008, and to report patient dosimetry and toxicity results.Methods and Materials: We initiated a phase 2 multicenter single arm study evaluating SBRT to the primary tumor (50-54 Gy in 3-5 fractions) followed by conventionally fractionated chemoradiation to 60 Gy in 2 Gy fractions with doublet chemotherapy to the involved lymph nodes for patients with stage III or unresectable stage II NSCLC. Patients eligible for adjuvant immunotherapy received up to 12 months of durvalumab. We report a detailed guide for the entire treatment process from computed tomography simulation through treat-ment planning and delivery. The dosimetric outcomes from the 60 patients who completed therapy on study are reported both for target coverage and normal structure doses. We also report correlation between radiation-related toxicities and dosimetric parameters.Results: Sixty patients were enrolled between 2017 and 2022. Planning techniques used were primarily volumetric modulated arc ther-apy for SBRT to the primary tumor and conventionally fractionated radiation to the involved nodes, with a minority of cases using dynamic conformal arc technique or static dynamic multileaf collimator intensity modulated radiation therapy. Grade 2 or higher pneumonitis was associated with lung dose V5 Gy > 70% and grade 2 or higher pulmonary toxicity was associated with lung dose V10 Gy > 50%. Only 3 patients (5%) experienced grade 3 or higher pneumonitis. Grade 2 or higher esophagitis was associated with esoph-ageal doses, including mean dose > 20 Gy, V60 Gy > 7%, and D1cc > 55 Gy. Only 1 patient (1.7%) experienced grade 3 esophagitis.Conclusions: SBRT to the primary tumor followed by conventionally fractionated chemoradiation to the involved lymph nodes is feasi-ble with planning techniques as described. Radiation-related toxicity on this phase 2 study was low. This manuscript serves as a guide-line for the recently activated NRG Oncology LU-008 phase 3 trial evaluating this experimental regimen.(c) 2023 American Society for Radiation Oncology.

TI  - Pneumonitis Incidence in Patients With Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer on Immunotherapy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer, often diagnosed at the advanced stage (metastatic). Treatment options for metastatic NSCLC include radiotherapy, chemotherapy, target drug therapy, and immunotherapy. Immunotherapy (utilization of checkpoint inhibitors) boosts the immune system to recognize and destroy cancer cells. However, it is often associated with immune-related complications such as pneumonitis. This review aims to determine the incidence of pneumonitis in metastatic NSCLC patients treated with different immunotherapy drugs. PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase databases were scoured for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) until October 2023. Published RCTs with similar research objectives were included, while non-English articles, reviews, case reports, ongoing trials, non-randomized studies, conference abstracts, and studies on small cell lung cancer (SCLC) were excluded. The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials (RoB 2) was used to assess the risk of bias among the included studies. The statistical analyses were performed with the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software. The subgroup analysis of the 16 included RCTs showed that metastatic NSCLC patients treated with nivolumab and pembrolizumab had a higher incidence of any grade pneumonitis than those treated with atezolizumab (4.5% and 5.1% vs. 1.6%, respectively). Similarly, the incidence of grade >= 3 pneumonitis was higher among patients receiving nivolumab (1.3%) and pembrolizumab (2.4%) than those receiving atezolizumab (0.7%). Furthermore, the subgroup analysis showed that patients with naive-treated NSCLC on immunotherapy had a higher incidence of any grade pneumonitis than those with previously treated NSCLC (6.5% vs. 3.9%). Treatment-naive patients recorded higher grade >= 3 pneumonitis incidences than those previously treated (3.1% vs. 1.3%). Programmed death 1 (PD-1) inhibitors (i.e., pembrolizumab and nivolumab) have higher incidences of pneumonitis than programmed death-ligand 1 inhibitors (atezolizumab).

TI  - Current Management and Progress in Radiotherapy for Small Cell Lung Cancer
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Radiotherapy (RT) and chemotherapy continue to be widely utilized in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) management. In most limited stage (LS)-SCLC cases, the standard initial therapy remains concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT), typically with an etoposide and platinum-based regimen. Hyperfractionated twice daily (BID) RT remains the standard of care, though conventional daily (QD) RT is now a viable alternative supported by randomized evidence. In LS-SCLC patients who experienced good response to CRT, prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) remains the standard of care. Brain imaging, ideally with MRI, should be performed prior to PCI to screen for clinically apparent brain metastases that may require a higher dose of cranial irradiation. Platinum doublet chemotherapy alone is the historic standard initial therapy in extensive stage (ES)-SCLC. Addition of immunotherapy such as atezolizumab and durvalumab to chemotherapy is now recommended after their benefits were demonstrated in recent trials. In patients with response to chemotherapy, consolidation thoracic RT and PCI could be considered, though with caveats. Emergence of hippocampal avoidance cranial irradiation and SRS in SCLC patients may supplant whole cranial irradiation as future standards of care. Incorporation of novel systemic therapies such as immunotherapies has changed the treatment paradigm and overall outlook of patients with SCLC. This narrative review summarizes the current state, ongoing trials, and future directions of radiotherapy in management of SCLC.

TI  - Thoracic irradiation as consolidation therapy in patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of reviewSmall cell lung cancer (SCLC) is marked by an exceptionally high proliferative rate and poor prognosis. Given its high propensity to metastasize, nearly two-thirds of SCLC patients are diagnosed with extensive-stage (ES) disease when surgery is not a treatment option anymore. Over several decades, only minimal changes have been made in the therapeutic armamentarium of ES-SCLC. Recently, however, several new therapeutic avenues were defined, thus renewing the hope for patients with this recalcitrant cancer. Here, we present an overview of the most current therapeutic advances in ES-SCLC focusing in particular on consolidative thoracic radiation therapy (cTRT) and chemo-immunotherapy.Recent findingsThe incorporation of immunotherapy in the standard-of-care of ES-SCLC patients and the resulting outcomes are both a remarkable hallmark of progress and a disappointment. Indeed, chemo-immunotherapy with or without cTRT and prophylactic cranial irradiation contributes to longer survival outcomes with minimal toxicity rates in well selected and properly monitored patients. Nevertheless, the gain in overall survival is still modest relative to that seen in many other solid tumors.Despite the encouraging results, further clinical trials are needed to determine the efficacy and safety of these therapeutic approaches, and moreover, to identify new predictive biomarkers of response.

TI  - Perioperative Immunotherapy for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: Practical Application of Emerging Data and New Challenges
T2  - CLINICAL LUNG CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Immune checkpoint inhibition, with or without chemotherapy, is an established standard of care for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). For locally advanced NSCLC treated with chemoradiotherapy, consolidation immunotherapy has dramatically improved outcomes. Recently, immunotherapy has also been established as a valuable component of treatment for resectable NSCLC with pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, and nivolumab all approved for use in this setting. As more results read out from ongoing per ioperative clinical tr ials, navigating treatment options will likely become increasingly complex for the practicing oncologist. In this paper, we distill key outcomes from major perioperative trials and highlight current knowledge gaps. In addition, we provide practical considerations for incorporating perioperative immunotherapy into the clinical management of operable NSCLC.

TI  - DARES: A Phase II Trial of Durvalumab and Ablative Radiation in Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer.
T2  - Clinical lung cancer
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Immunotherapy in combination with chemotherapy is first-line treatment for patients with extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). Growing evidence suggests that radiation, specifically stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), may enhance the immunogenic response as well as cytoreduce tumor burden. The primary objective of the study is to determine the progression free survival for patients with newly diagnosed ES-SCLC treated with combination multisite SBRT and chemo-immunotherapy (carboplatin, etoposide, and durvalumab).METHODS: This is a multicenter, single arm, phase 2 study. Patients with treatment-naive, ES-SCLC will be eligible for this study. Patients will receive durvalumab 1500mg IV q3w, carboplatin AUC 5 to 6 mg/mL q3w, and etoposide 80 to 100 mg/m2 on days 1 to 3 q3w for four cycles, followed by durvalumab 1500mg IV q4w until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Ablative radiation will be delivered 1 to 4 extracranial sites in 3 or 5 fractions, determined by location, during cycle 2. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival, measured from day 1 of chemoimmunotherapy. Secondary endpoints include grade ≥3 toxicity by CTCAE v5.0 within three months of RT, overall survival, response rate, time to second line systemic therapy, and time to new distant progression.CONCLUSIONS: Now that immunotherapy is an established part of ES-SCLC management, it is important to further optimize its use and effect. This study will investigate the progression-free survival of combined SBRT and chemo-immunotherapy in patients with ES-SCLC. In addition, the data from this study may further inform the immunogenic role of SBRT with chemo-immunotherapy, as well as identify clinical, biological, or radiomic prognostic features.

T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - When treating patients with unresectable stage III non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), those with a good performance status and disease measured within a radical treatment volume should be considered for definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy (cCRT). This guidance is based on key scientific rationale from two large Phase 3 randomised studies and meta-analyses demonstrating the superiority of cCRT over sequential (sCRT). However, the efficacy of cCRT comes at the cost of increased acute toxicity versus sequential treatment. Currently, there are several documented approaches that are addressing this drawback, which this paper outlines. At the point of diagnosis, a multidisciplinary team (MDT) approach can enable accurate assessment of patients, to determine the optimal treatment strategy to minimise risks. In addition, reviewing the Advisory Committee on Radiation Oncology Practice (ACROP) guidelines can provide clinical oncologists with additional recommendations for outlining target volume and organ-at-risk delineation for standard clinical scenarios in definitive cCRT (and adjuvant radiotherapy). Furthermore, modern advances in radiotherapy treatment planning software and treatment delivery mean that radiation oncologists can safely treat substantially larger lung tumours with higher radiotherapy doses, with greater accuracy, whilst minimising the radiotherapy dose to the surrounding healthy tissues. The combination of these advances in cCRT may assist in creating comprehensive strategies to allow patients to receive potentially curative benefits from treatments such as immunotherapy, as well as minimising treatment-related risks.

AB  - Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a rapidly progressive neuroendocrine carcinoma that, until recently, had a very small armamentarium of effective treatments. Advances in DNA sequencing and whole transcriptomics have delineated key subtypes; therefore, SCLC is no longer viewed as a homogeneous cancer. Chemoimmunotherapy with PD1 blockade is now the standard of care for advanced disease, and ongoing research efforts are moving this strategy into the limited stage setting. Combination strategies of immunotherapy with radiation are also under active clinical trial in both limited and extensive stage disease. Plain Language Summary Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a rapidly progressive neuroendocrine carcinoma that, until recently, had a very small armamentarium of effective treatments.Chemoimmunotherapy with immune check point inhibitors is now the standard of care for advanced disease.This comprehensive review provides an overview of current treatment strategies for SCLC, unmet needs in this patient population, and emerging treatment strategies incorporating immunotherapy that will hopefully further improve outcomes for patients.

TI  - Emerging drugs for small cell lung cancer: a focused review on immune checkpoint inhibitors
T2  - EXPERT OPINION ON EMERGING DRUGS
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive malignancy that accounts for 15% of all lung cancers. It is characterized by initial responsiveness to therapy followed by rapid disease progression that is relatively resistant to further treatment. Recently, the addition of an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) to chemotherapy has improved survival in patients with advanced disease, the first advance in systemic therapy in SCLC in over 30 years. Areas covered In this review, we present an overview of SCLC with a focus on the scope of the problem and standard treatment, followed by a critical assessment of scientific rationale for immunotherapy in SCLC and the clinical trials that have been performed with ICIs in SCLC. Finally, we address ongoing hurdles for the development of ICIs in SCLC and potential avenues for further study. Expert opinion Despite solid biological rationale, the results of clinical trials of ICIs in SCLC have yielded modest benefits. A small subset of patients does achieve long-term benefit, but further development of ICIs in SCLC will depend on the identification of predictive biomarkers and the design of combination regimens that take advantage of the molecular alterations that drive the immune-avoidance mechanisms and survival of SCLC cells.

TI  - Management of Brain Metastases in the New Era of Checkpoint Inhibition
T2  - CURRENT NEUROLOGY AND NEUROSCIENCE REPORTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of the Review Brain metastasis is a common complication of advanced malignancies, especially, lung cancer, breast cancer, renal cell carcinoma, and melanoma. Traditionally surgery, when indicated, and radiation therapy, either as whole-brain radiation therapy or stereotactic radiosurgery, constituted the major treatment options for brain metastases. Until recently, most of the systemic chemotherapy agents had limited activity for brain metastases. However, with the advent of small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors and immunotherapy agents, there has been renewed interest in using these agents in the management of brain metastases.Recent Findings Immune checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized the treatment of metastatic melanoma, lung cancer, kidney cancer, and bladder cancer among others. They modulate the immune system to recognize tumor antigens as "non-self" antigens and mount an immune response against them.Summary Initial studies of using immune checkpoint inhibitors in brain metastases have shown promising activity, and several clinical trials are currently underway. Studies are also assessing the combination of radiation therapy and immunotherapy in brain metastases. The results of these ongoing clinical trials have the potential to change the therapeutic paradigm in patients with brain metastases.

TI  - Feasibility and long-term outcomes of post-chemotherapy-based consolidation radiotherapy in extensive stage small-cell lung cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE NATIONAL CANCER CENTER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The target definition of consolidation radiotherapy (RT) for extensive stage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) has not been standardized. This study aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of post-chemotherapy based consolidation RT in ES-SCLC.Methods: All ES-SCLC patients without initial brain metastases who completed >= 4 cycles of systemic therapy at Department of Radiation and Medical Oncology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from 2012 to 2021 were included in this retrospective study. We correlated the site of first recurrence to the post-chemotherapy-based radiation volume (small-field). Relapse pattern, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were compared between those received and did not receive consolidation RT.Results: A total of 152 patients were followed up for a median of 31.7 months (interquartile range [IQR], 23.9- 39.6 months). The median PFS and OS of the cohort were 8.3 months (IQR, 6.1-11.2 months) and 16.2 months (IQR, 9.9-24.9 months), respectively. Thoracic consolidation RT served not only as an independent prognostic factor for improved PFS in the entire cohort, but also significantly prolonged OS in the subgroup without syn-chronous liver metastases. Small-field consolidation RT markedly reduced in-field recurrences (hazard ratio [HR], 0.28 [95% CI, 0.12-0.38]; P < 0.001) without increasing out-of-field recurrences (HR, 0.40 [95% CI, 0.13-1.16]; P = 0.080). No relapse was observed at the margin of the targets. Treatment-related toxicities were moderate, with grade 3 acute radiation pneumonia, radiation esophagitis, and bone marrow suppression rates of 8.3%, 3.1%, and 12.5%, respectively. No grade 5 toxicity occurred.Conclusion: Small-field consolidation RT based on post-chemotherapy volume is safe and can significantly im -prove local control in ES-SCLC.

T2  - CANCER COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Review
AB  - In China, lung cancer is a primary cancer type with high incidence and mortality. Risk factors for lung cancer include tobacco use, family history, radiation exposure, and the presence of chronic lung diseases. Most early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients miss the optimal timing for treatment due to the lack of clinical presentations. Population-based nationwide screening programs are of significant help in increasing the early detection and survival rates of NSCLC in China. The understanding of molecular carcinogenesis and the identification of oncogenic drivers dramatically facilitate the development of targeted therapy for NSCLC, thus prolonging survival in patients with positive drivers. In the exploration of immune escape mechanisms, programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor monotherapy and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor plus chemotherapy have become a standard of care for advanced NSCLC in China. In the Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology's guidelines for NSCLC, maintenance immunotherapy is recommended for locally advanced NSCLC after chemoradiotherapy. Adjuvant immunotherapy and neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy will be approved for resectable NSCLC. In this review, we summarized recent advances in NSCLC in China in terms of epidemiology, biology, molecular pathology, pathogenesis, screening, diagnosis, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy.

TI  - Chemotherapy-free radiotherapy combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors: a new regimen for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer?
T2  - CANCER BIOLOGY & MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Maintenance immunotherapy after concurrent chemoradiotherapy remains the standard therapeutic approach in patients with unresectable locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC). The efficacy of pembrolizumab without chemotherapy in stage IV NSCLC has incited interest in similar approaches for LA-NSCLC. Several recent investigations involving the synergistic potential of immunotherapy combined with radiotherapy (iRT) have generated encouraging results. This review discusses the existing studies and prospective directions of chemotherapy-free iRT strategies in unresectable LA-NSCLC. Although the initial findings of chemotherapy-free iRT strategies have shown promising efficacy, we must consider the methodologic limitations of current studies and the myriad of challenges that accompany the implementation of chemotherapy-free iRT. These challenges include determining the optimal dose and fractionation, precise target volume delineation, and identification of additional suitable patient cohorts. Furthermore, the feasibility of chemotherapy-free iRT as a novel treatment modality for select patients with LA-NSCLC is contingent upon validation through randomized phase III trials.

TI  - Prophylactic cranial irradiation or MRI surveillance for extensive stage small cell lung cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF THORACIC DISEASE
M3  - Review
AB  - The treatment paradigm for extensive stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) is evolving. Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) has long been considered a component of standard treatment in patients with extensive stage disease who respond to chemotherapy. However, in the modern era of magnetic resonance imaging, the role of PCI has become an area of controversy following conflicting level I evidence. Due to conflicting data and toxicity concerns, the routine use of PCI has declined. Recent improvements in systemic disease control with the use of immunotherapy and reductions in the toxicity attributable to PCI with hippocampal avoidance and memantine have reignited the discussion. As such, we present here a narrative review of PCI with a focus on historical milestones, randomized data, risk mitigation and future directions.

TI  - Radiation Therapy for Small Cell Lung Cancer: An ASTRO Clinical Practice Guideline
T2  - PRACTICAL RADIATION ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Several sentinel phase III randomized trials have recently been published challenging traditional radiation therapy (RT) practices for small cell lung cancer (SCLC). This American Society for Radiation Oncology guideline reviews the evidence for thoracic RT and prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) for both limited-stage (LS) and extensive-stage (ES) SCLC.Methods: The American Society for Radiation Oncology convened a task force to address 4 key questions focused on indications, dose fractionation, techniques and timing of thoracic RT for LS-SCLC, the role of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) compared with conventional RT in stage I or II node negative SCLC, PCI for LS-SCLC and ES-SCLC, and thoracic consolidation for ES-SCLC. Recommendations were based on a systematic literature review and created using a consensus-building methodology and system for grading evidence quality and recommendation strength.Results: The task force strongly recommends definitive thoracic RT administered once or twice daily early in the course of treatment for LS-SCLC. Adjuvant RT is conditionally recommended in surgically resected patients with positive margins or nodal metastases. Involved field RT delivered using conformal advanced treatment modalities to postchemotherapy volumes is also strongly recommended. For patients with stage I or II node negative disease, SBRT or conventional fractionation is strongly recommended, and chemotherapy should be delivered before or after SBRT. In LS-SCLC, PCI is strongly recommended for stage II or III patients who responded to chemoradiation, conditionally not recommended for stage I patients, and should be a shared decision for patients at higher risk of neurocognitive toxicities. In ES-SCLC, radiation oncologist consultation for consideration of PCI versus magnetic resonance surveillance is strongly recommended. Lastly, the use of thoracic RT is strongly recommended in select patients with ES-SCLC after chemotherapy treatment, including a conditional recommendation in those responding to chemotherapy and immunotherapy.Conclusions: RT plays a vital role in both LS-SCLC and ES-SCLC. These guidelines inform best clinical practices for local therapy in SCLC. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of American Society for Radiation Oncology.

TI  - Protocol of the TREASURE study: Thoracic RadiothErapy with Atezolizumab in Small cell lUng canceR Extensive disease - a randomized, open-label, multicenter phase II trial
T2  - BMC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Recently, the combination of the programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor atezolizumab with first-line chemotherapy has demonstrated to improve outcome for patients with advanced small cell lung cancer (SCLC), leading to approval of this regimen. At the same time, accumulating (pre-)clinical data suggest synergisms of radiotherapy and immunotherapy via the radiation-mediated induction of anti-tumor immunogenicity. Combining the recent findings, the TREASURE trial aims at further enhancing response to upfront chemo-immunotherapy by the addition of thoracic radiotherapy ( TRT).Methods/design: The TREASURE trial is a randomized, multicenter, phase II clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT04462276). One hundred four patients suffering from extensive disease (ED) SCLC, with any response to the standard of care induction chemo-immunotherapy will be randomized to receive atezolizumab maintenance therapy with or without TRT. The primary endpoint of this study is overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints include further measures of efficacy, safety, and the collection of biomarker samples. A safety interim analysis will take place after n = 23 patients receiving TRT have been observed for three months after the end of TRT.Discussion: This trial will investigate whether treatment efficacy can be improved by adding TRT to atezolizumab maintenance therapy in ED SCLC patients with any response after chemo-immunotherapy. Safety and feasibility of such a regimen will be evaluated, and biomaterials for a translational research project will be collected. Together, the results of this trial will deepen our comprehension of how checkpoint inhibition and radiotherapy interact and contribute to the evolving landscape of SCLC therapy.

TI  - Immunotherapy for Non-small-cell Lung Cancer: Current Status and Future Obstacles
T2  - IMMUNE NETWORK
M3  - Review
AB  - Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. There are 2 major subtypes of lung cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). Studies show that NSCLC is the more prevalent type of lung cancer that accounts for approximately 80%-85% of cases. Although, various treatment methods, such as chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation therapy have been used to treat lung cancer patients, there is an emergent need to develop more effective approaches to deal with advanced stages of tumors. Recently, immunotherapy has emerged as a new approach to combat with such tumors. The development and success of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)/program death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) blockades in treating metastatic cancers opens a new pavement for the future research. The current mini review discusses the significance of immune checkpoint inhibitors in promoting the death of tumor cells. Additionally, this review also addresses the importance of tumor-specific antigens (neoantigens) in the development of cancer vaccines and major challenges associated with this therapy. Immunotherapy can be a promising approach to treat NSCLC because it stimulates host's own immune system to recognize cancer cells. Therefore, future research should focus on the development of new methodologies to identify novel checkpoint inhibitors and potential neoantigens.

TI  - Developments in radiation techniques for thoracic malignancies
T2  - EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Radiation therapy is a cornerstone of modern lung cancer treatment alongside surgery, chemotherapy, immunotherapy and targeted therapies. Advances in radiotherapy techniques have enhanced the accuracy of radiation delivery, which has contributed to the evolution of radiation therapy into a guideline-recommended treatment in both early-stage and locally advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer. Furthermore, although radiotherapy has long been used for palliation of disease in advanced lung cancer, it is increasingly having a role as a locally ablative treatment in patients with oligometastatic disease.This review provides an overview of recent developments in radiation techniques, particularly for non-radiation oncologists who are involved in the care of lung cancer patients. Technical advances are discussed, and findings of recent clinical trials are highlighted, all of which have led to a changing perception of the role of radiation therapy in multidisciplinary care.

TI  - Alliance A082002-a randomized phase II/III trial of modern immunotherapy-based systemic therapy with or without SBRT for PD-L1-negative, advanced non-small cell lung cancer
T2  - CLINICAL LUNG CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Treatment of advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has changed dramatically due to immunotherapy. However, patients without Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) protein expression often benefit less from immunotherapy. This trial is designed to test if stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) to a single tumor site can significantly enhance the outcome of patients with advanced stage PD-L1(-) NSCLC when added to systemic therapy including immunotherapy. Materials and Methods: Alliance A082002 is based on subgroup analysis from the randomized phase II PEMBRO-RT trial., PEMBRO-RT compared pembrolizumab alone or with SBRT and revealed improved progression-free and overall survival (PFS and OS, respectively) in PD-L1(-) patients when adding SBRT (8 Gy x 3 fractions). In A082002, patients without PD-L1 expression will be randomized to SBRT (8 Gy x3) plus systemic therapy vs. systemic therapy alone. The pr imary endpoint of the phase II portion of the tr ial is PFS and will require 100 patients. The primary endpoint of the phase III portion of the trial is OS and will require an additional 284 patients. This trial will clarify whether adding SBRT to systemic therapy can improve PFS and OS in a larger multi-institutional cohort. Several systemic treatment options are allowed including either immunotherapy alone or chemo-immunotherapy. Conclusions: This phase II/III Alliance trial A082002 will test whether the addition of SBRT to a single tumor site will enhance the anti-tumor activity of systemic immunotherapy or chemo-immunotherapy in patients with stage IV PD-L1(-) NSCLC. It is now open in the National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN).

TI  - Effect of Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy on Diverse Organ Lesions in Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients Receiving Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors
T2  - CURRENT MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveThe combination of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) is actively being explored in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. However, little is known about the optimal fractionation and radiotherapy target lesions in this scenario. This study investigated the effect of SBRT on diverse organ lesions and radiotherapy dose fractionation regimens on the prognosis of advanced NSCLC patients receiving ICIs.MethodsThe medical records of advanced NSCLC patients consecutively treated with ICIs and SBRT were retrospectively reviewed at our institution from Dec. 2015 to Sep. 2021. Patients were grouped according to radiation sites. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were recorded using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared between different treatment groups using the log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test.ResultsA total of 124 advanced NSCLC patients receiving ICIs combined with SBRT were identified in this study. Radiation sites included lung lesions (lung group, n=43), bone metastases (bone group, n=24), and brain metastases (brain group, n=57). Compared with the brain group, the mean PFS (mPFS) in the lung group was significantly prolonged by 13.3 months (8.5 months vs. 21.8 months, HR=0.51, 95%CI: 0.28-0.92, P=0.0195), and that in the bone group prolonged by 9.5 months with a 43% reduction in the risk of disease progression (8.5 months vs. 18.0 months, HR=0.57, 95%CI: 0.29-1.13, P=0.1095). The mPFS in the lung group was prolonged by 3.8 months as compared with that in the bone group. The mean OS (mOS) in the lung and bone groups was longer than that of the brain group, and the risk of death decreased by up to 60% in the lung and bone groups as compared with that of the brain group. When SBRT was concurrently given with ICIs, the mPFS in the lung and brain groups were significantly longer than that of the bone group (29.6 months vs. 16.5 months vs. 12.1 months). When SBRT with 8-12 Gy per fraction was combined with ICIs, the mPFS in the lung group was significantly prolonged as compared with that of the bone and brain groups (25.4 months vs. 15.2 months vs. 12.0 months). Among patients receiving SBRT on lung lesions and brain metastases, the mPFS in the concurrent group was longer than that of the SBRT -> ICIs group (29.6 months vs. 11.4 months, P=0.0003 and 12.1 months vs. 8.9 months, P=0.2559). Among patients receiving SBRT with <8 Gy and 8-12 Gy per fraction, the mPFS in the concurrent group was also longer than that of the SBRT -> ICIs group (20.1 months vs. 5.3 months, P=0.0033 and 24.0 months vs. 13.4 months, P=0.1311). The disease control rates of the lung, bone, and brain groups were 90.7%, 83.3%, and 70.1%, respectively.ConclusionThe study demonstrated that the addition of SBRT on lung lesions versus bone and brain metastases to ICIs improved the prognosis in advanced NSCLC patients. This improvement was related to the sequence of radiotherapy combined with ICIs and the radiotherapy fractionation regimens. Dose fractionation regimens of 8-12 Gy per fraction and lung lesions as radiotherapy targets might be the appropriate choice for advanced NSCLC patients receiving ICIs combined with SBRT.

TI  - How to integrate stereotactic body radiation therapy and hypofractionation in the management of stage III lung cancer in the age of immunotherapy
T2  - ANALES DEL SISTEMA SANITARIO DE NAVARRA
M3  - Review
AB  - The constant advances in the field of lung cancer immunotherapy have recently reached the treatment of locally advanced disease with the approval of durvalumab after concurrent chemoradiation. However, radiation therapy continues to be key for controlling the disease at this stage. Over the years, different strategies have been employed to try to optimize outcomes using radiotherapy, with cardiac and pulmonary toxicity as the main limitation on its success. The interest in the use of hypofractionation and stereotactic body radiation therapy for stage III non-small cell lung cancer has increased as knowledge regarding these kinds of treatments has been enhanced. Hypofractionation is a relatively frequent treatment, although the level of evidence that supports it is limited. For its part, stereotactic body radiation therapy has been particularly studied as a boost after chemoradiation, with encouraging results. In both cases, study of how to integrate these tools with chemotherapy and particularly with immunotherapy is essential, as they may have an immunomodulatory role.YY

TI  - Hypofractionated radiotherapy with immunochemotherapy for extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer
T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionThe combination of a PD-L1 inhibitor plus carboplatin/cisplatin and etoposide (EC/EP) has become a new standard first-line treatment for extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). Combining concurrent palliative hypofractionated radiotherapy of the thorax (HFRT) and immunochemotherapy may have a synergistic effect. In this study, we explored an optimal model of combination radiotherapy with immunochemotherapy as first-line treatment of ES-SCLC. Patients and methodsIn this multicenter single-arm phase 2 trial, patients with ES-SCLC received atezolizumab with EC/EP for two cycles (induction phase), then, those who did not progress received concurrent palliative HFRT and two cycles of atezolizumab with EC/EP (combination phase). Afterward they received atezolizumab every 3 weeks for a maximum of 2 years after study enrolment (maintenance phase). Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) was recommended. The primary endpoints were safety and tolerance; the second endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS). ResultsForty patients were enrolled, and all had completed palliative HFRT and four cycles of immunochemotherapy. There were seven grade 3 adverse events (3 decreased neutrophil count, 1 anemia, 2 pneumonitis, 1 esoenteritis), two grade 4 adverse events (2 decreased white cell count) and no grade 5 toxicities. The pneumonitis rate was 12.5% (three grade 2 and two grade 3 events). At the median follow-up of 14.2 months (range, 6.8-28.7), the median PFS was 8.6 months (95%CI, 6.1-11.1). ConclusionThe addition of concurrent hypofractionated thoracic radiotherapy to first-line immunochemotherapy for ES-SCLC was well tolerated and showed promising clinical efficacy. Additional randomized trials are needed to validate benefits.

TI  - Recent developments in radiotherapy for small-cell lung cancer: a review by the Oncologic Group for the Study of Lung Cancer (Spanish Radiation Oncology Society)
T2  - CLINICAL & TRANSLATIONAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for 13% of all lung tumours. The standard treatment in patients with limited-stage disease is radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy. In extensive SCLC, the importance of consolidation thoracic radiotherapy in patients with a good treatment response has become increasingly recognized. In both limited and extensive disease, prophylactic cranial irradiation is recommended in patients who respond to treatment. New therapeutic approaches such as immunotherapy are being increasingly incorporated into the treatment of SCLC, although more slowly than in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Diverse radiation dose and fractionation schemes, administered in varying combinations with these new drugs, are being investigated. In the present study we review and update the role of radiotherapy in the treatment of SCLC. We also discuss the main clinical trials currently underway in order to identify future trends.

TI  - PD-L1 inhibitors combined with whole brain radiotherapy in patients with small cell lung cancer brain metastases: Real-world evidence
T2  - CANCER MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Numerous studies have demonstrated that brain metastases patients may benefit from intracranial radiotherapy combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). However, it is unclear whether this treatment is effective for patients with small cell lung cancer brain metastases (SCLC-BMs). Methods: We conducted a retrospective study by analyzing medical records of patients with SCLC-BMs from January 1, 2017 to June 1, 2022. Data related to median overall survival (mOS), median progression-free survival (mPFS), and intracranial progression-free survival (iPFS) were analyzed. Results: A total of 109 patients were enrolled, of which 60 received WBRT and 49 received WBRT-ICI. Compared to the WBRT alone cohort, the WBRT-ICI cohort showed longer mOS (20.4 months vs. 29.3 months, p = 0.021), mPFS (7.9 months vs. 15.1 months, p < 0.001), and iPFS (8.3 months vs. 16.5 months, p < 0.001). Furthermore, WBRT-ICI cohort had a better response rate for both BMs. (p = 0.035) and extracranial diseases (p < 0.001) compared to those receiving WBRT alone. Notably, the use of WBRT before ICI was associated with longer mOS compared to the use of WBRT after ICI (23.3 months for the ICI-WBRT group vs. 34.8 months for the WBRT-ICI group, p = 0.020). Conclusion: Our results indicated that WBRT combined with immunotherapy improved survival in SCLC-BMs patients compared to WBRT monotherapy. Administering WBRT prior to ICI treatment is associated with improved survival outcomes compared to WBRT following ICI treatment, for patients with SCLC-BMs. These findings highlight the significance of conducting further prospective researches on combination strategies of intracranial radiotherapy and ICI in SCLC-BMs patients.

TI  - Systemic Immunostimulatory Effects of Radiation Therapy Improves the Outcomes of Patients With Advanced NSCLC Receiving Immunotherapy
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY-CANCER CLINICAL TRIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - The understanding of localized radiation therapy's immunostimulatory properties combined with its well-known effects on the cell cycle and insights into the immunomodulation mechanisms that occur at the molecular and cellular levels has changed our traditional view of the anticancer effects of ionizing radiation. The potential interactions between the tumor's immune system and radiation therapy have revealed that local radiation has the ability to induce systemic antitumor responses in patients with advanced cancers. The recognition of systemic antitumor effects of radiation therapy has allowed investigators to begin uncovering the integral players in these pathways. Parallel to this, there has been progress in understanding how tumor immunology leads to the development of novel immunotherapies using immune checkpoint blockade therapies in the treatment of advanced cancers. To date there has been limited success in this benefiting only a small fraction of patients. The concept of priming the body's immune system by radiation to make less responsive tumors more responsive to immunotherapy provides an opportunity to explore the use of the combination of radiation therapy and immunotherapy for the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer and other cancers. This article provides an overview of the current state of knowledge of the clinical experience using radiation therapy in combination with immune therapy and discusses the rationale for integrating these 2 modalities in the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Available data supports the use of radiation therapy in combination with immunotherapy to achieve improved local and systemic tumor control. Evidence from the early clinical trials has shown that using radiation therapy and immune checkpoint blockade therapies together produces a greater clinical effect than using either modality alone. To maximize the clinical benefit and successful integration of these two modalities as well as optimizing radiation therapy dosing and its schedule, improvement in its field design and the development of reliable predictors of clinical tumor response needs to be established.

TI  - An Overview of the Role of Radiotherapy in the Treatment of Small Cell Lung Cancer- A Mainstay of Treatment or a Modality in Decline?
T2  - CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for about 15% of all lung cancers. Chemotherapy, immunotherapy and radiotherapy all play important roles in the management of SCLC. The aim of this study was to provide a comprehensive overview of the role and evidence of radiotherapy in the cure and palliation of SCLC.Materials and methods: The search strategy included a search of the PubMed database, hand searches, reference lists of relevant review articles and relevant published abstracts. ClinicalTrials.gov was also queried for relevant trials.Results: Thoracic radiotherapy improves overall survival in limited stage SCLC, but the timing and dose remain controversial. The role of thoracic radiotherapy in extensive stage SCLC with immunotherapy is the subject of several ongoing trials. Current evidence supports the use of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) for limited stage SCLC but the evidence is equivocal in extensive stage SCLC. Whole brain radiotherapy is well established for the treatment of brain metastases but evidence is rapidly accumulating for the use of stereotactic radiosurgery. Further studies will define the role of PCI, whole brain radiotherapy and hippocampal avoidant PCI in the immunotherapy era.Conclusion: Radiotherapy is an essential component in the multimodality management of SCLC. Technological advances have allowed safer delivery of radiotherapy with reduced toxicities. Discussion at multidisciplinary team meetings is important to ensure radiotherapy is considered and offered in appro-priate patients.Crown Copyright (c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Royal College of Radiologists.

M3  - Review
AB  - Treatment of stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) traditionally has involved combinations of chemotherapy, radiation, and surgical resection. Although the multimodality approach remains standard, only a fraction of patients with stage III lung cancer can undergo complete resection, and long-term prognosis remains poor. The PACIFIC trial generated significant enthusiasm when it demonstrated that the programmed death ligand-1 inhibitor, durvalumab, improved survival in patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC after completion of definitive concurrent chemoradiation. This article reviews the indications for traditional therapies in stage III NSCLC and highlights ongoing advances that have led to the incorporation of novel therapeutic agents.

TI  - The Real-World Outcome of First Line Atezolizumab in Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Multicenter Prospective Cohort Study
T2  - CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose The addition of immune checkpoint inhibitors to chemotherapy has improved survival outcomes in patients with extensivestage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). However, their real -world effectiveness remains unknown. Therefore, we investigated the effectiveness of atezolizumab plus chemotherapy in ES-SCLC in actual clinical settings. Materials and Methods In this multicenter prospective cohort study, patients with ES-SCLC receiving or scheduled to receive atezolizumab in combination with etoposide and carboplatin were enrolled between June 2021 and August 2022. The primary outcomes were progression -free survival (PFS) and the 1 -year overall survival (OS) rate. Results A total of 100 patients with ES-SCLC were enrolled from seven centers. Median age was 69 years, and 6% had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) >= 2. The median PFS was 6.0 months, the 1 -year OS rate was 62.2%, and the median OS was 13.5 months. An ECOG PS of 2-3 and progressive disease as the best response were poor prognostic factors for PFS, while an ECOG PS of 2-3 and brain metastasis were associated with poor prognosis for OS. In addition, consolidative thoracic radiotherapy was found to be an independent favorable prognostic factor for OS (hazard ratio, 0.336; p=0.021). Grade >= 3 treatmentrelated adverse events were observed in 7% of patients, with treatment -related deaths occurring in 2% of patients. Conclusion We provided evidence of the favorable real -world effectiveness and safety of atezolizumab plus chemotherapy in ES-SCLC patients, including in the elderly and those with poor ECOG PS. Additional consolidative thoracic radiotherapy may also benefit ES-SCLC patients.

TI  - Checkpoint inhibition in combination with an immunoboost of external beam radiotherapy in solid tumors (CHEERS): study protocol for a phase 2, open-label, randomized controlled trial
T2  - BMC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: While the introduction of checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs) as standard of care treatment for various tumor types has led to considerable improvements in clinical outcome, the majority of patients still fail to respond. Preclinical data suggest that stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) could work synergistically with CPIs by acting as an in situ cancer vaccine, thus potentially increasing response rates and prolonging disease control. Though SBRT administered concurrently with CPIs has been shown to be safe, evidence of its efficacy from large randomized trials is still lacking. The aim of this multicenter randomized phase II trial is to assess whether SBRT administered concurrently with CPIs could prolong progression-free survival as compared to standard of care in patients with advanced solid tumors.Methods/design: Ninety-eight patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to receive CPI treatment combined with SBRT (Arm A) or CPI monotherapy (Arm B). Randomization will be stratified according to tumor histology (melanoma, renal, urothelial, head and neck squamous cell or non-small cell lung carcinoma) and disease burden (<= or > 3 cancer lesions). The recommended SBRT dose is 24Gy in 3 fractions, which will be administered to a maximum of 3 lesions and is to be completed prior to the second or third CPI cycle (depending on CPI treatment schedule). The study's primary endpoint is progression-free survival as per iRECIST. Secondary endpoints include overall survival, objective response, local control, quality of life and toxicity. Translational analyses will be performed using blood, fecal and tissue samples. Discussion: The CHEERS trial will provide further insights into the clinical and immunological impact of SBRT when combined with CPIs in patients with advanced solid tumors. Furthermore, study results will inform the design of future immuno-radiotherapy trials.

TI  - The Use of Palliative Radiotherapy in the Treatment of Lung Cancer
T2  - CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - There have been significant advances in the systemic treatment of stage IV lung cancer, which is now recommended first line in patients with adequate fitness. This includes some patients with brain metastases due to the increased understanding of the central nervous system penetration of targeted therapies. The trials evidence base for palliative radiotherapy pre-dated this routine use of systemic therapy in our practice, which means that the sequence and role of palliative radiotherapy are not currently well defined in the first-line treatment setting. However, due to its efficacy in symptom control, radiotherapy remains a core component in the palliative management of lung cancer, particularly in the second-line setting and those unsuited to primary systemic treatment. This overview focuses on the evidence behind palliative radiotherapy to the thorax and brain for non-small cell and small cell lung cancer and the potential for future studies, including the TOURIST Trial Platform, to guide the future direction of these treatments.Crown Copyright (c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Royal College of Radiologists.

TI  - Chemo-radiotherapy integration in unresectable locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer: a review
T2  - CLINICAL & TRANSLATIONAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Approximately one-third of all non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are locally-advanced at diagnosis, and 15-17% of these tumors are unresectable at presentation. Definitive chemo-radiotherapy (CRT) represents the standard therapeutic approach. However, the literature has shown that only 15% of patients are alive at 5 years and this percentage has remained unchanged despite various attempts of improvement. The recent introduction of immunotherapy has not only strongly changed the clinical scenario but has also drawn attention to a stage of disease apparently forgotten for decades. Stage III NSCLC can represent an interesting setting for the combined use of chemo-radiation and immunotherapy, due to the potential synergistic effect between radiation and immune checkpoint inhibitors. We reviewed the available literature in order to report the state of art of stage III NSCLC, by focusing on trials that evaluate different combinations of CRT and new drugs of PD-1/PD-L1 axis, and anti-CTLA-4. The future goal in the management of unresectable stage III NSCLC will be the optimal patients' selection combined with the use of individualized immuno/chemotherapies that could potentially improve clinical outcomes.

TI  - Systemic therapies in the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer brain metastases
T2  - FUTURE ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) brain metastases are common. Even though there are various subsets of NSCLC with molecular alterations, there is a common theme of brain metastases. Current treatment modalities are suboptimal. Systemic therapies for the treatment of NSCLC brain metastases have been explored and recent advances may pave the way for their successful employment in this patient population. While no specific agents have been associated with a marked benefit, stability of disease as well as radiographic responses have been noted in some patients. Biological activity of systemic therapies in some patients with NSCLC brain metastases raises hope for future advances and supports further investigation for this patient population with limited treatment options.

TI  - Recent advances in small cell lung cancer: the future is now?
T2  - MINERVA ENDOCRINOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Small cell lung cancer is a relevant clinical issue as it is a highly malignant cancer, often diagnosed in advanced stage. Similarly to non-small cell lung cancer, tobacco smoking is currently the main risk factor. Its incidence, at least in males, has declined over the past decades, due to the worldwide decreased percentage of active smokers. The typical small cells of this tumor type are characterized by a high Proliferation Index, chromosomal deletions such as 3p(14-23) involving the tumor-suppressor gene FHIT, alterations of the MYC or Notch family proteins and the frequent expression of neu-roendocrine markers. The combination of thoracic radiotherapy and chemotherapy is the standard treatment for limited stage disease, while platinum-based chemotherapy is the most effective choice for extensive stage disease. Unfortunately, whatever chemotherapy is used, the results are disappointing. No regimen has proved to be effective in the long run, in-deed small cell lung cancer rapidly progresses after a frequent initial strong response, and the mortality rate remains still high. The advent of immunotherapy is actually changing the landscape in oncology. As well as in other cancers, recent trials have demonstrated the efficacy of the combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors and chemotherapy, opening new perspectives for the future of our patients.

T2  - TRANSLATIONAL LUNG CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Small cell lung cancer has been a difficult disease to treat with poor survival and few significant improvements in outcomes in the last three decades. Most recently the addition of atezolizumab to chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) resulted in improved overall survival and progression-free survival compared to chemotherapy alone. Recent randomized studies examining both consolidative thoracic radiotherapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in ES-SCLC have impacted the utilization of these interventions. The approval of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) to platinum/etoposide chemotherapy for the treatment of ES-SCLC in the front-line setting may also further impact the role of radiotherapy in this disease. In this article, we review the current evidence supporting thoracic radiotherapy in ES-SCLC and discuss the promising therapeutic implications of thoracic radiation in light of the inclusion of ICIs. We also address how the increasing routine use of surveillance brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ICIs may diminish the use of PCI in ES-SCLC.

TI  - Advances in immunotherapy for treatment of lung cancer
T2  - CANCER BIOLOGY & MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Different approaches for treating lung cancer have been developed over time, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy and targeted therapies against activating mutations. Lately, better understanding of the role of the immunological system in tumor control has opened multiple doors to implement different strategies to enhance immune response against cancer cells. It is known that tumor cells elude immune response by several mechanisms. The development of monoclonal antibodies against the checkpoint inhibitor programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1), on T cells, has led to high activity in cancer patients with long lasting responses. Nivolumab, an anti PD-1 inhibitor, has been recently approved for the treatment of squamous cell lung cancer patients, given the survival advantage demonstrated in a phase III trial. Pembrolizumab, another anti PD-1 antibody, has received FDA breakthrough therapy designation for treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), supported by data from a phase I trial. Clinical trials with anti PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies in NSCLC have demonstrated very good tolerability and activity with response rates around 20% and a median duration of response of 18 months.

TI  - A Review of Concurrent Chemo/Radiation, Immunotherapy, Radiation Planning, and Biomarkers for Locally Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer and Their Role in the Development of ECOG-ACRIN EA5181
T2  - CLINICAL LUNG CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - ECOG-ACRIN EA5181 is a current prospective, randomized trial that is investigating whether the addition of concomitant durvalumab to standard chemo/radiation followed by 1 year of consolidative durvalumab results in an overall survival benefit over standard chemo/radiation alone followed by 1 year of consolidative durvalumab in patients with locally advanced, unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Because multiple phase I/II trials have shown the relative safety of adding immunotherapy to chemo/radiation and due to the known synergism between chemotherapy and immunotherapy, it is hoped that concomitant durvalumab can reduce the relatively high incidence of local failure (38%46%) as seen in recent prospective, randomized trials of standard chemo/radiation in this patient population. We will review the history of radiation for LA-NSCLC and discuss the role of induction, concurrent and consolidative chemotherapy as well as the concerns for late cardiac and pulmonary toxicities associated with treatment. Furthermore, we will review the potential role of next generation sequencing, PD-L1, ctDNA and tumor mutation burden and their possible impact on this trial.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness of immune checkpoint inhibitors in the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer as a second line in Taiwan
T2  - FUTURE ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of immune checkpoint inhibitors versus docetaxel in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. Methods: A Markov model was constructed to simulate the clinical outcomes and costs of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. Clinical outcomes data were derived from randomized clinical trials. Drug acquisition cost and other health resource use were obtained from the claim data of a tertiary hospital and the National Health Insurance. The outcome was an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio expressed as cost per quality-adjusted life year gained. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the uncertainty of the model parameters. Results: In the base case, patients treated with immunotherapies in the second line were associated with higher costs and higher mean survival. The incremental costs per quality-adjusted life year gained for pembrolizumab, nivolumab, or atezolizumab compared to docetaxel were NT$416,102, NT$1,572,912 and NT$1,580,469, respectively. Conclusion: The results showed that pembrolizumab was more cost effective than nivolumab and atezolizumab compared with docetaxel as a second-line regimen for patients with previously treated advanced non-small-cell lung cancer at willingness to pay threshold in Taiwan.Plain language summary Lung cancer is the first leading cause of cancer death in Taiwan. About 75% of patients have advanced disease at the time of diagnosis (stage III/IV) with a median survival of 13.2 months. Most non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients are usually diagnosed at a late stage. The conventional chemotherapy, surgery or radiation regimens may not be of significant benefits. Fortunately, newer immunotherapies or targeted therapies have improved the 5-year survival rates of advanced NSCLC from 15 to 50% with high cost. This study aimed to assess if the newer targeted therapies are cost effective and provide 'value for money' compared with chemotherapy in NSCLC patients with advanced stage. A cost-effectiveness model was created based on the data from the real-world and published phase III randomized controlled trials. The results showed that pembrolizumab is more cost effective than nivolumab and atezolizumab compared with docetaxel as a second-line regimen for patients with previously treated advanced NSCLC at willingness to pay threshold in Taiwan.

TI  - Radiotherapy and Immunotherapy-A Future Partnership towards a New Standard
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The impressive results in terms of survival brought by immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) in metastatic malignant melanoma and the transformation of this disease with a poor prognosis into a chronic disease even with long-term survival cases have opened horizons for a new era in cancer treatments. Later, therapy with CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors became standard in other solid tumors, especially in relapsed and metastatic settings. The PACIFIC clinical trial revolutionized the concept of consolidation immunotherapy after the favorable response to curative chemoradiotherapy in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Two new effects will govern the future of the immunotherapy-radiotherapy association: the local "in situ" vaccination effect and the systemic remote "abscopal" response. Even if stereotactic body irradiation (SBRT) or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRT) seems to be more effective in generating the synergistic effect, the PACIFIC trial demonstrates the role of conventional irradiation in combination with chemotherapy in modulating the host's immune response. Thus, the radiotherapy-chemotherapy-immunotherapy triad may become the future standard in locally advanced disease. The different mechanisms of producing immune-mediated cell death and the indirect role of augmenting the immune effect induced by radiotherapy make the old theories related to the therapeutic sequence, fractionation, doses, and target volumes as well as the protection of healthy tissues to be re-evaluated. The new concept of immuno-radiotherapy in synergistic association has as its physiopathological substrate the dual immunosuppressive and enhancement of antitumor response to irradiation, including the activation of the immune effectors in the tumor microenvironment (TME). The choice of sequential treatment, a hypofractionated irradiation regime, and the possible omission of lymph node irradiation with the limitation of lymphopenia could tilt the balance in favor of the activation and potentiation of the antitumor immune response. The selection of therapeutic targets chosen for the combination of immunotherapy and associated radiotherapy can be conducted based on the classification of tumors in the three immune phenotypes that characterize "cold" and "hot" tumors from the point of view of the response to therapy.

TI  - Immunotherapy for early-stage non-small cell lung cancer: A system review
T2  - JOURNAL OF CANCER RESEARCH AND THERAPEUTICS
M3  - Review
AB  - With the addition of immunotherapy, lung cancer, one of the most common cancers with high mortality rates, has broadened the treatment landscape. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have demonstrated significant efficacy in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and are now used as the first-line therapy for metastatic disease, consolidation therapy after radiotherapy for unresectable locally advanced disease, and adjuvant therapy after surgical resection and chemotherapy for resectable disease. The use of adjuvant and neoadjuvant immunotherapy in patients with early-stage NSCLC, however, is still debatable. We will address several aspects, namely the initial efficacy of monotherapy, the efficacy of combination chemotherapy, immunotherapy-related biomarkers, adverse effects, ongoing randomized controlled trials, and current issues and future directions for immunotherapy in early-stage NSCLC will be discussed here.

T2  - ONCOLOGIST
M3  - Article
AB  - The prevalence of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) has declined in the U.S. as the prevalence of tobacco use has declined. However, a significant number of people in the U.S. are current or former smokers and are at risk of developing SCLC. Routine histological or cytological evaluation can reliably make the diagnosis of SCLC, and immunohistochemistry stains (thyroid transcription factor-1, chromogranin, synaptophysin, and CD56) can be used if there is uncertainty about the diagnosis. Rarely do patients present with SCLC amendable to surgical resection, and evaluation requires a meticulous workup for extra-thoracic metastases and invasive staging of the mediastinum. Resected patients require adjuvant chemotherapy and/or thoracic radiation therapy (TRT), and prophylactic cranial radiation (PCI) should be considered depending on the stage. For limited-stage disease, concurrent platinum-etoposide and TRT followed by PCI is the standard. Thoracic radiation therapy should be started early in treatment, and can be given twice daily to 45 Gy or once daily to 60-70 Gy. For extensive-stage disease, platinum-etoposide remains the standard first-line therapy, and the standard second-line therapy is topotecan. Preliminary studies have demonstrated the activity of immunotherapy, and the response rate is approximately 10-30% with some durable responses observed. Rovalpituzumab tesirine, an antibody drug conjugate, has shown promising activity in patients with high delta-like protein 3 tumor expression (approximately 70% of patients with SCLC). The emergence of these and other promising agents has rekindled interest in drug development in SCLC. Several ongoing trials are investigating novel agents in the first-line, maintenance, and second-line settings.

TI  - Radiotherapy for unresectable locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer: a narrative review of the current landscape and future prospects in the era of immunotherapy
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL LUNG CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Significant recent advances have occurred in the use of radiation therapy for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC). In fact, the past few decades have seen both therapeutic gains and setbacks in the evolution of radiotherapy for LA-NSCLC. The PACIFIC trial has heralded a new era of immunotherapy and has raised important questions for future study, such as the future directions of radiation therapy for LA-NSCLC in the era of immunotherapy. Modern radiotherapy techniques such as three-dimensional (3D) conformal radiotherapy and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) provide opportunities for improved target conformity and reduced normal-tissue exposure. However, the low-dose radiation volume brought by IMRT and its effects on the immune system deserve particular attention when combing radiotherapy and immunotherapy. Particle radiotherapy offers dosimetric advantages and exhibits great immunoregulatory potential. With the ongoing improvement in particle radiotherapy techniques and knowledge, the combination of immunotherapy and particle radiotherapy has tremendous potential to improve treatment outcomes. Of particular importance are questions on the optimal radiation schedule in the settings of radio-immunotherapy. Strategies for the reduction of the irradiated field such as involved-field irradiation (IFI) and omission of clinical target volume (CTV) hold promise for better preservation of immune function while not compromising locoregional and distant control. In addition, different dose-fractionation regimens can have diverse effects on the immune system. Thus, prospective trials are urgently needed to establish the optimal dose fractionation regimen. Moreover, personalized radiotherapy which allows the tailoring of radiation dose to each individual's genetic background and immune state is of critical importance in maximizing the benefit of radiation to patients with LA-NSCLC.

TI  - Evidence to Date: Evaluating Pembrolizumab in the Treatment of Extensive-Stage Small-Cell Lung Cancer
T2  - CLINICS AND PRACTICE
M3  - Review
AB  - Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive subtype of lung cancer characterized by a rapid initial response and early development of resistance to systemic therapy and radiation. The management of SCLC significantly changed for the first time in decades with the introduction of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Pembrolizumab, a humanized IgG4 isotype antibody, targets the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) pathway to restore anti-tumor immunity. Prospective trials of pembrolizumab in patients with previously treated SCLC showed significant durability of responses. These results led to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granting pembrolizumab accelerated approval as second- or third-line monotherapy for patients with extensive-stage (ES) SCLC. In a recent clinical trial that included patients with previously untreated ES-SCLC, pembrolizumab in combination with platinum/etoposide met its progression-free survival endpoint, but overall survival (OS) did not cross the threshold for superiority. With the therapeutic landscape for SCLC rapidly evolving, we review prior experience and future directions of pembrolizumab in ES-SCLC.

TI  - Induction PD-1 inhibitor toripalimab plus chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy and consolidation toripalimab for bulky locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer: protocol for a randomized phase II trial (InTRist study)
T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized the treatment landscape for locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC), whereas responses to anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) or anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) are heterogeneous. Though consolidation ICI following concurrent chemoradiotherapy (cCRT) improves survival of NSCLC, this regimen is challenging for patients with bulky tumors due to excessive target volumes and radiation-resistant hypoxia during upfront cCRT, leading to higher risk of pneumonitis and inferior local-regional control. Recent trials have demonstrated neoadjuvant ICI brought greater benefit to stage III than stage I-II NSCLC. Our previous study also supported the therapeutic advantage of 2-cycle induction ICI for patients with bulky unresectable stage III NSCLC. In the context of induction immunotherapy, radiotherapy is more likely to exert immune synergistic effects, reverse anti-PD-1 resistance, and activate abscopal immune responses. Prospective trials to determine the efficacy and safety of induction ICI for bulky LA-NSCLC are necessary. Methods: This randomized, open-label, two-arm phase II study aims to explore whether 2 cycles of induction anti-PD-1 toripalimab plus chemotherapy can improve progression-free survival (PFS) in bulky LA-NSCLC. Bulky tumors are defined as primary lesion >= 5 cm in greatest dimension or metastatic lymph nodes >= 2 cm in shortest diameter. A total of 50 patients with bulky unresectable stage III NSCLC will be recruited and 1:1 randomized into the experimental arm: 2-cycle induction PD-1 inhibitor toripalimab plus chemotherapy followed by cCRT and consolidation toripalimab; or control arm: 2-cycle induction chemotherapy followed by cCRT and consolidation toripalimab. Patients are stratified by pathology (squamous versus non-squamous). The primary endpoint is PFS. Secondary endpoints are overall survival, overall response rate, disease control rate, duration of response, and incidence of adverse events. Exploratory analyses include PD-L1 expression and liquid biopsy-based biomarker testing, tumor microenvironment profiling at single-cell levels, and quality-of-life assessments. Discussion: The InTRist study is the first randomized phase II trial to investigate the feasibility of induction anti-PD-1 toripalimab plus chemotherapy followed by cCRT and consolidation toripalimab in bulky LA-NSCLC, providing novel evidence for the synergistic strategy combining anti-PD-1 blockade with radiotherapy to prolong immunotherapy benefits, overcome resistance, and enhance abscopal immune response.

TI  - Consolidation systemic treatment after radiochemotherapy for unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer
T2  - CANCER TREATMENT REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - The majority of stage HI NSCLC patients managed with a combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy will develop a locoregional or distant relapse. Concomitant radiochemotherapy allows for improved local control but has no impact on extrathoracic recurrences. To ameliorate this inefficiency the concept of consolidation treatment has been put forward, whereby systemically active doses of chemotherapy, targeted therapy or immune therapy are administered after completion of radiochemotherapy. Randomized trials failed to provide support for consolidation chemotherapy or anti-EGFR therapies. Recently durvalumab, an anti-PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor, administered as consolidation treatment, was shown to substantially improve progression-free survival. This article critically reviews major studies addressing the role of consolidation systemic therapies following definitive concurrent radiochemotherapy and discusses prospects for future research.

TI  - Anlotinib combined with durvalumab in a patient with recurrent multifocal brain metastases of small cell lung cancer after definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy and palliative radiotherapy of the lung and brain: a case report
T2  - ANNALS OF PALLIATIVE MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The brain is a common metastatic site of small cell lung cancer (SCLC), but systematic treatment options are limited by the blood-brain barrier. Currently, the optimal treatment regimen remains controversial, especially for patients already treated by brain radiotherapy. Anlotinib is a novel oral multitarget tyrosine kinase inhibitor which has shown significant improvement in progression-free survival and overall survival in third-line or beyond therapy of advanced SCLC in a randomized, double-blind phase II study (ALTER1202 trial) based on a Chinese population sample. Emerging data has also suggested that immunotherapy, such as the programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor, has a relatively high response rate in brain metastatic SCLC, although there is a lack of large sample-size studies. Integrating anlotinib and immunotherapy for recurrent or relapsing brain metastases (BMs) of SCLC has not been previously reported, but it is possible that these two treatments may have synergistic effects and provide even better outcomes. Here, we present a case of stage III SCLC who developed lung and BMs after concurrent chemoradiotherapy (cCRT) and achieved radiographic locally complete regression following whole brain irradiation (WBI) with a simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) technique. Durvalumab was delivered as maintenance therapy. Asymptomatic multifocal recurrence of BMs occurred after the administration of the second dose of durvalumab. After administration of combined durvalumab and anlotinib, the BMs achieved near-complete regression and no severe toxicity was reported. This suggests a potential synergistic effect of combined durvalumab and anlotinib in previously treated BMs in a patient with SCLC and may provide a direction for future clinical decisions.

TI  - Evolution of systemic therapy for stages I-III non-metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer
T2  - NATURE REVIEWS CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The treatment goal for patients with early-stage lung cancer is cure. Multidisciplinary discussions of surgical resectability and medical operability determine the modality of definitive local treatment (surgery or radiotherapy) and the associated systemic therapies to further improve the likelihood of cure. Trial evidence supports cisplatin-based adjuvant therapy either after surgical resection or concurrently with radiotherapy. Consensus guidelines support neoadjuvant chemotherapy in lieu of adjuvant chemotherapy and carboplatin-based regimens for patients who are ineligible for cisplatin. The incorporation of newer agents, now standard for patients with stage IV lung cancer, into the curative therapy paradigm has lagged owing to inefficient trial designs, the lengthy follow-up needed to assess survival end points and a developmental focus on the advanced-stage disease setting. Surrogate end points, such as pathological response, are being studied and might shorten trial durations. In 2018, the anti-PD-L1 antibody durvalumab was approved for patients with stage III lung cancer after concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Since then, the study of targeted therapies and immunotherapies in patients with early-stage lung cancer has rapidly expanded. In this Review, we present the current considerations in the treatment of patients with early-stage lung cancer and explore the current and future state of clinical research to develop systemic therapies for non-metastatic lung cancer.

T2  - LUNG CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - About 40% of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) develop brain metastases (BMs) throughout the disease, and the occurrence of BMs is considered to have a fairly high mortality rate. Therefore, the management of brain metastases in NSCLC patients is a clinical challenge. Currently, multidisciplinary diagnosis and treatment methods are often used to achieve effective control of intracranial disease and prolong survival. Immunotherapy (IT) is one of the core therapies for NSCLC. Single or combined IT represented by immune checkpoint inhibitors(ICIs) of programmed death-1(PD-1)/ programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) can significantly improve the prognosis of patients with advanced NSCLC.ICIs has been shown to be safe and effective in patients with BMs, although patients with BMs are mostly underrepresented in randomized clinical trials. In this review, we summarized the mechanism of ICIs in the treatment of BMs, and the clinical research and treatment progress of ICIs and their combination with other therapies in patients with BMs s from NSCLC.

TI  - Use of radiation therapy among patients with Extensive-stage Small-cell lung cancer receiving Immunotherapy: Canadian consensus recommendations
T2  - LUNG CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Thoracic radiation therapy (TRT) and prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) are commonly used in the management of extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC); however, Phase III trials of first-line immu-notherapy often excluded these options. Guidance is needed regarding appropriate use of TRT, PCI, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) surveillance while new data are awaited.Materials and methods: In two web-based meetings, a pan-Canadian expert working group of five radiation on-cologists and four medical oncologists addressed eight clinical questions regarding use of radiation therapy (RT) and MRI surveillance among patients with ES-SCLC receiving immunotherapy. A targeted literature review was conducted using PubMed and conference proceedings to identify recent (January 2019-April 2022) publications in this setting. Fifteen recommendations were developed; online voting was conducted to gauge agreement with each recommendation.Results: After considering recently available evidence across lung cancer populations and clinical experience, the experts recommended that all patients with a response to chemo-immunotherapy, good performance status (PS), and limited metastases be considered for consolidation TRT (e.g., 30 Gy in 10 fractions). When considered appropriate after multidisciplinary team discussion, TRT can be initiated during maintenance immunotherapy. All patients who respond to concurrent chemo-immunotherapy should undergo restaging with brain MRI to guide decision-making regarding PCI versus MRI surveillance alone. MRI surveillance should be conducted for two years after response to initial therapy. PCI (e.g., 25 Gy in 10 fractions or 20 Gy in 5 fractions) can be considered for patients without central nervous system involvement who have a response to chemo-immunotherapy and good PS. Concurrent treatment with PCI and immunotherapy or with TRT, PCI, and immunotherapy is appropriate after completion of initial therapy. All recommendations were agreed upon unanimously.Conclusions: These consensus recommendations provide practical guidance regarding appropriate use of RT and immunotherapy in ES-SCLC while awaiting new clinical trial data.

M3  - Review
AB  - Opinion statementNon-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 85% of new lung cancer cases and has 5-year survival rates ranging from 92% in early-stage disease to as low as 13% in locally advanced cases. Radiation therapy is a key component in the treatment repertoire for NSCLC, where it is currently used alone or in combinations with chemotherapy and surgery. Despite the broad use of modern photon radiation techniques, as many as 25% of patients experience isolated locoregional recurrences, and toxicity has been proven to be a limiting factor in many cases. Proton beam therapy (PBT) has emerged as a potential solution to improve upon clinical outcomes in both early-stage and locally advanced disease. The proton beam allows for a sharp dose build-up and drop-off, which is particularly important in lung cancer where nearby structures include the heart, spinal cord, esophagus, and uninvolved lung. There are now numerous studies showing dosimetric advantages of PBT in early and locally advanced NSCLC, particularly in the heart and lung doses. Randomized data comparing clinical outcomes between proton and photon radiation are limited to a small number of studies. Despite early results suggesting improvements or at least comparable outcomes with PBT, the most recent randomized comparisons have failed to show significant differences in toxicity and local control between photon and proton therapy. As newer PBT techniques (e.g., intensity-modulated proton therapy) are increasingly utilized, more dramatic improvements in tumor control and toxicity may be demonstrated. It is also important to recognize that there may be certain subpopulations in which the benefits of proton therapy are greater, such as central early-stage tumors, previously irradiated tumors, and locally advanced tumors, while others may best be treated with traditional photon techniques. As immunotherapy becomes more prevalent in the treatment of NSCLC, improving local control and limiting the toxicity contributed by radiation will be increasingly important. The unique dosimetric advantages of PBT may allow for tumor dose escalation while maintaining normal tissue doses to improve local control, or treating the tumor to the standard dose while decreasing normal tissue doses to improve toxicity. Finally, given the high costs of proton therapy, where low insurance approval rates have limited trial enrollment, it will be important to determine the overall cost-benefit ratio.

AB  - Small cell lung cancer represents a disease with poor prognosis. Despite rapid progress in the fields of medical or radiation oncology, the treatment strategy of the small cell lung cancer has remained almost unchanged for over the last 30 years. Prophylactic cranial irradiation and irradiation of the primary lung tumor according to CREST clinical trial improved the median overall survival in months. Until the launch on immunotherapy, the systemic treatment didnt make significant progress, unfortunately including targeted therapy. Immunotherapy significantly changed the treatment outcomes of the several tumor types and finally even the prognosis of small cell lung cancer. Clinical trials with atezolizumab and durvalumab have further moved forward the median overall survival by more than 2 months without significant increase in the treatment toxicity and worsening of the patients quality of life. In the combination with chemotherapy, atezolizumab and durvalumab represents a new gold standard in the treatment of small cell lung cancer.

AB  - This review addresses means for improving treatment results in small cell and non-small cell lung cancer. In small cell lung cancer lactate dehydrogenase and neuron-specific enolase seem to be important prognostic factors that may reflect not only tumor load but also growth rate. Chemotherapy seems to induce or select differentiated cells in small cell lung cancer, which focuses attention on other treatment modalities such as drugs, which can induce terminally differentiated nonproliferating cells. Scheduling of chemotherapy may improve survival, especially in extensive disease patients. Exciting new techniques for tumor targeting by a radiolabelled somatostatin-analogue and radiolabelled murine anti-epidermal growth factor are reported. The possible adverse effect of heterologous blood transfusions on survival after surgery of stage I and II non-small cell lung cancer remains a very important subject for investigation to solve the essential question whether the need for transfusion or the transfusion itself is the adverse prognostic factor. A possible improvement of survival of non-small cell lung cancer patients by chemotherapy should be investigated in patients with an excellent performance score and a small tumor load, eg, stage IIIa and IIIb patients. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy in such patients may improve survival but a better and especially more uniform design of the trials is urgently needed. Finally, the development of techniques to palliate terminally ill patients quickly and easily by reopening a closed bronchial lumen should be encouraged.

M3  - Review
AB  - Lung cancer is the second most common and the deadliest type of cancer worldwide. Clinically, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common pathological type of lung cancer; approximately one-third of affected patients have locally advanced NSCLC (LA-NSCLC, stage III NSCLC) at diagnosis. Because of its heterogeneity, LA-NSCLC often requires multidisciplinary assessment. Moreover, the prognosis of affected patients is much below satisfaction, and the efficacy of traditional therapeutic strategies has reached a plateau. With the emergence of targeted therapies and immunotherapies, as well as the continuous development of novel radiotherapies, we have entered an era of novel treatment paradigm for LA-NSCLC. Here, we reviewed the landscape of relevant therapeutic modalities, including adjuvant, neoadjuvant, and perioperative targeted and immune strategies in patients with resectable LA-NSCLC with/without oncogenic alterations; as well as novel combinations of chemoradiation and immunotherapy/targeted therapy in unresectable LA-NSCLC. We addressed the unresolved challenges that remain in the field, and examined future directions to optimize clinical management and increase the cure rate of LA-NSCLC.

M3  - Review
AB  - Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive subtype of lung cancer characterized by rapid growth and early spread. It is a highly lethal disease that typically is diagnosed at a late stage. Surgery plays a very small role in this cancer, and management typically involves chemotherapy, delivered with thoracic radiation in early-stage disease. Platinum-based chemotherapy is initially very effective, inducing rapid and often deep responses. These responses, though, are transient, and upon relapse, SCLC is highly refractory to therapy. Immunotherapy has shown promise in delivering meaningful, durable responses and the addition of immunotherapy to first-line chemotherapy has led to the first improvements in survival in decades. Still, the disease remains difficult to manage. Incorporating radiation therapy at specific points in patient management may improve disease control. The development of predictive biomarkers and novel targeted therapies will hopefully improve options for patients in the near future. This review focuses on the current standards of care and future directions.

AB  - Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 85% of the cases of lung cancer in the United States, and 70% of patients with NSCLC have locally advanced or metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. The 5-year overall survival rate for patients with locally advanced NSCLC is 15% to 20%. The traditional treatment paradigm for unresectable locally advanced NSCLC consists of platinum-based chemotherapy with concurrent radiation. Evidence from phase 3 clinical trials has established a role for immunotherapy after chemoradiation, and emerging data continue to elucidate the expanding role of immunotherapy.

M3  - Review
AB  - The prognosis of limited-stage small cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC) continues to improve and is now roughly comparable to that of locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This shift, taken together with the decreased toxicities of modern radiotherapy (RT) for LS-SCLC compared with those reported in historical trials, necessitates further evaluation of whether proton beam therapy (PBT) could further reduce both acute and late toxicities for patients receiving concurrent chemoradiotherapy forLSSCLC. These notions are discussed theoretically, with an emphasis on cardiac events. This is followed by a review of the published evidence to date demonstrating improved dosimetry with PBT over intensity-modulated RT and encouraging safety and efficacy profiles seen in early clinical reports. In addition to covering technical aspects of PBT for LS-SCLC such as intensity-modulated PBT, image-guidance for PBT, and adaptive planning, this review also discusses the need for increased data on intensity-modulated PBT for LS-SCLC, economic and quality of life analyses for future PBT SCLC studies, careful categorization of cardiac events in these patients, and the role for immunotherapy combined with photon-or proton-based RT for LS-SCLC.

TI  - Immunotherapy in Advanced NSCLC Without Driver Mutations: Available Therapeutic Alternatives After Progression and Future Treatment Options
T2  - CLINICAL LUNG CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - The treatment paradigm of non-small-cell lung cancer without oncogenic drivers has varied dramatically in recent years and is constantly evolving. Immune-checkpoint inhibitors have demonstrated unprecedented durable efficacy in a subset of these patients, so these drugs have become the standard of care in most cases. There are different ways to deliver these agents, such as monotherapy and combinations of immunotherapy or chemotherapy plus immunother-apy. Treatment selection is complicated by an absence of head-to-head comparisons in randomized trials because these agents have gained approval by demonstrating super ior ity to platinum-doublet chemotherapy alone. Unfortu-nately, most patients will progress and die from their disease despite advances. Furthermore, after progression on these agents, there is a lack of randomized controlled data to support further management, constituting an unmet need. This review discusses the therapeutic alternatives after progression, summarizes mechanisms of resistance and progression patterns, and describes the main approaches under clinical investigation in the field.

TI  - Pneumonitis Risk After Chemoradiotherapy With and Without Immunotherapy in Patients With Locally Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION ONCOLOGY BIOLOGY PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Chemoradiotherapy (CRT) combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) is the standard of care for patients with unresectable and locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer. This study aimed to determine whether the addition of ICIs to CRT is associated with an increased risk of pneumonitis. Methods and Materials: The PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases were searched for eligible studies published between January 1, 2015, and July 31, 2023. The outcome of interest was the incidence rate of pneumonitis. A random-effects model was used for statistical analysis. Results: A total of 185 studies with 24,527 patients were included. The pooled rate of grade >= 2 pneumonitis for CRT plus ICIs was significantly higher than that for CRT alone (29.6%; 95% CI, 25.7%-33.6% vs 20.2%; 95% CI, 17.7%-22.8%; P < .0001) but not that of grade >= 3 (5.7%; 95% CI, 4.8%-6.6% vs 5.6%; 95% CI, 4.7%-6.5%; P = .64) or grade 5 (0.1%; 95% CI, 0.0%-0.2% vs 0.3%; 95% CI, 0.1%-0.4%; P = .68). The results from the subgroup analyses of prospective studies, retrospective studies, Asian and non-Asian studies, concurrent CRT (cCRT), and durvalumab consolidation were comparable to the overall results. However, CRT or cCRT plus PD-1 inhibitors not only significantly increased the incidence of grade >= 2 but also that of grade >= 3 pneumonitis compared to CRT alone or cCRT plus PD-L1 inhibitors. Conclusions: Compared with CRT alone, durvalumab consolidation after CRT appears to be associated with a higher incidence of moderate pneumonitis and CRT plus PD-1 inhibitors with an increased risk of severe pneumonitis. Nevertheless, these findings are based on observational studies and need to be validated in future large head-to-head studies.

TI  - Intrathoracic Progression Is Still the Most Dominant Failure Pattern after First-Line Chemo-immunotherapy in Extensive-Stage Small-Cell Lung Cancer: Implications for Thoracic Radiotherapy
T2  - CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose This study aimed to compare the failure patterns before and after the introduction of immunotherapy and to determine the role of thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) in extensive -stage small -cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) treatment. Materials and Methods We retrospectively reviewed 294 patients with ES-SCLC, of which 62.2% underwent chemotherapy alone, 13.3% underwent chemotherapy followed by consolidative TRT (TRT group), and 24.5% underwent chemotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI group). We performed propensity -score matching (PSM) to compare each treatment group. Results The median follow-up duration was 10.4 months. At the first relapse, in the cohort showing objective response, the proportion of cases showing intrathoracic progression was significantly lower in the TRT group (37.8%) than in the chemotherapy -alone (77.2%, p < 0.001) and the ICI (60.3%, p=0.03) groups. Furthermore, in the subgroup analysis, TRT showed benefits related to intrathoracic progression -free survival (PFS) in comparison with ICI in patients with less than two involved extrathoracic sites (p=0.008) or without liver metastasis (p=0.02) or pleural metastasis (p=0.005) at diagnosis. After PSM, the TRT group showed significantly better intrathoracic PFS than both chemotherapy -alone and ICI groups (p < 0.001 and p=0.04, respectively), but showed no significant benefit in terms of PFS and overall survival in comparison with the ICI group (p=0.17 and p=0.31, respectively). Conclusion In ES-SCLC, intrathoracic progression was the most dominant failure pattern after immunotherapy. In the era of chemoimmunotherapy, consolidative TRT can still be considered a useful treatment strategy for locoregional control.

TI  - Design and Rationale for a Phase III, Randomized, Placebo-controlled Trial of Durvalumab With or Without Tremelimumab After Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy for Patients With Limited-stage Small-cell Lung Cancer: The ADRIATIC Study
T2  - CLINICAL LUNG CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Limited-stage (LS) small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) remains an area of high unmet medical need. The standard-of-care therapy comprises curative-intent platinum-based chemotherapy with concurrent radiotherapy (cCRT), which can be followed by prophylactic brain irradiation and then observation. However, most patients will relapse. Durvalumab (antiprogrammed cell death ligand-1) has enhanced the efficacy outcomes after cCRT for patients with unresectable, stage III non-small-cell lung cancer. Recently, durvalumab combined with platinum-etoposide demonstrated a significant survival benefit compared with platinum-etoposide as first-line treatment of patients with extensive-stage SCLC and has also shown antitumor activity as monotherapy and combined with tremelimumab (anticytotoxic T-lymphocyte eassociated antigen-4) in pretreated patients with extensive-stage SCLC. ADRIATIC, a phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, global study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT03703297), is designed to investigate the efficacy of durvalumab, with or without tremelimumab, as consolidation therapy for patients with LS-SCLC without disease progression after cCRT. Approximately 600 patients with documented histologic or cytologic LS-SCLC, World Health Organization/Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 or 1, and no progression after 4 cycles of cCRT will be randomized (1:1:1) to treatment (durvalumab 1500 mg plus placebo every 4 weeks [q4w] for 4 cycles, followed by durvalumab 1500 mg q4w; durvalumab 1500 mg plus tremelimumab 75 mg q4w for 4 cycles, followed by durvalumab 1500 mg q4w; or dual placebo q4w for 4 cycles, followed by single placebo q4w) within 1 to 42 days of completing cCRT, stratified by stage and receipt of prophylactic brain irradiation. The primary endpoints are progression-free survival and overall survival. The secondary endpoints are overall survival and progression-free survival rates, objective response rate, and safety and tolerability. Recruitment began in September 2018.

TI  - Current landscape and future of dual anti-CTLA4 and PD-1/PD-L1 blockade immunotherapy in cancer; lessons learned from clinical trials with melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
T2  - JOURNAL FOR IMMUNOTHERAPY OF CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - Immunotherapy is among the most rapidly evolving treatment strategies in oncology. The therapeutic potential of immune-checkpoint inhibitors is exemplified by the recent hail of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approvals for their use in various malignancies. Continued efforts to enhance outcomes with immunotherapy agents have led to the formulation of advanced treatment strategies. Recent evidence from pre-clinical studies evaluating immune-checkpoint inhibitors in various cancer cell-lines has suggested that combinatorial approaches may have superior survival outcomes compared to single-agent immunotherapy regimens. Preliminary trials assessing combination therapy with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 plus anti-CTLA-4 immune-checkpoint inhibitors have documented considerable advantages in survival indices over single-agent immunotherapy. The therapeutic potential of combinatorial approaches is highlighted by the recent FDA approval of nivolumab plus ipilimumab for patients with advanced melanoma. Presently, dual-immune checkpoint inhibition with anti-programmed death receptor-1/programmed cell death receptor-ligand-1 (anti-PD-1/PD-L1) plus anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated antigen-4 (anti-CTLA-4) monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) is being evaluated for a wide range of tumor histologies. Furthermore, several ongoing clinical trials are investigating combination checkpoint inhibition in association with traditional treatment modalities such as chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation. In this review, we summarize the current landscape of combination therapy with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 plus anti-CTLA-4 MoAbs for patients with melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We present a synopsis of the prospects for expanding the indications of dual immune-checkpoint inhibition therapy to a more diverse set of tumor histologies.

TI  - Pneumonitis with combined immune checkpoint inhibitors and chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - FUTURE ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Plain language summaryCombined immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) and chemoradiotherapy (CRT) may cause severe pneumonitis due to overlapped pulmonary toxicity. However, the safety data on pneumonitis are limited to a small number of prospective clinical trials and retrospective studies with limited evidence. Thus we conducted a systematic review of pneumonitis in relation to the combination treatment. A total of 35 studies, involving 5000 patients, were included for the final analysis. The pooled rates of all-grade, grade 3-5 and grade 5 pneumonitis were 33.0, 6.1 and 0.8%, respectively, and 7.6% of patients stopped taking ICIs because of pneumonitis. The pneumonitis rates following combined CRT and ICIs for LA-NSCLC were acceptable, but the pulmonary toxicity of concurrent CRT and nivolumab plus ipilimumab should be noted.Aims: This study systematically evaluated cases of pneumonitis following combined immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) and chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC). Methods: Studies from Embase, PubMed and the Cochrane Library on patients with LA-NSCLC who received CRT and ICIs were reviewed. The primary outcomes were rates of all-grade, grade 3-5 and grade 5 pneumonitis. Results: Overall, 35 studies involving 5000 patients were enrolled. The pooled rates of all-grade, grade 3-5 and grade 5 pneumonitis were 33.0% (95% CI: 23.5-42.6), 6.1% (95% CI: 4.7-7.4) and 0.8% (95% CI: 0.3-1.2), respectively, with 7.6% of patients discontinuing ICIs because of pneumonitis. Conclusion: The incidence rates of pneumonitis following combined CRT and ICIs for LA-NSCLC were acceptable. However, the pulmonary toxicity of concurrent CRT and nivolumab plus ipilimumab should be noted.

TI  - A narrative review of toxicity of chemoradiation and immunotherapy for unresectable, locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL LUNG CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Despite declining smoking rates, lung cancer remains the second most common malignancy in the United States and the leading cause of cancer-related mortality. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) comprises roughly 85% of cases, and patients tend to present with advanced disease. Historically, concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) has been the standard of care for stage III unresectable NSCLC but outcomes even with multimodal therapy have remained relatively poor. Efforts to improve outcomes through radiation dose escalation with conventional dose fractionation were unsuccessful with RTOG 0617, demonstrating significantly decreased overall survival (OS) with high dose radiation with respect to standard therapy. The recent PACIFIC trial established a new role for consolidative immune checkpoint blockade therapy after CRT using the programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor durvalumab, by demonstrating significantly improved progression free survival and OS. Although promising, the addition of immunotherapy to multimodal therapy has generated debate regarding the most effective immune pathways to target, appropriate sequencing of therapy, most effective radiation techniques, and toxicity-related concerns. This review will highlight recent and ongoing trials in unresectable, locally advanced NSCLC that incorporate chemotherapy, radiation, and immunotherapy with an emphasis on analysis of treatment-related toxicities and implications for future study design.

TI  - Radiotherapy Patterns of Care for Locally-advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer in the Pre- and Post-durvalumab Era: A Region-wide Survey in a Japanese Prefecture
T2  - JOURNAL OF RADIATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The promising results of the PACIFIC study led to the approval of consolidation durvalumab for coverage by the National Health Insurance (NHI) in 2018 for patients with locally-advanced unresectable non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) treated with definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT). However, the effect of NHI coverage on the patterns of care for this population remains unclear. Here, we conducted a questionnaire-based survey to determine the patterns of care for patients with stage II-III NSCLC treated with definitive radiotherapy in 2017 (pre-durvalumab era) or in 2019 (post-durvalumab era). Data were obtained from 11 radiotherapy facilities in Gunma prefecture, which has a population of 1.94 million. We identified 80 and 83 patients with stage II-III NSCLC who received definitive radiotherapy in Gunma in 2017 and 2019, respectively. At a given facility, CCRT was the treatment of choice in a significantly greater proportion of patients in 2019 than in 2017 (66% +/- 20% vs 51% +/- 29%, P = 0.041). Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) was more frequent in 2019 than in 2017 (24% vs 1.2%). Carboplatin plus paclitaxel was used for CCRT at higher rate in 2019 than in 2017 (73% vs 44%). Consolidation durvalumab was performed in 73% (40/55) of CCRT-treated patients in 2019, and the treatment was performed for the planned 12 months in 45% (18/40) of patients. These data indicate that NHI coverage of durvalumab might be a possible reason for choosing CCRT in patients with stage II-III NSCLC in the real-world setting.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of G-CSF prophylaxis in patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer receiving chemoimmunotherapy
T2  - EXPERT OPINION ON PHARMACOTHERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectivesWe aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) prophylaxis during chemoimmunotherapy with carboplatin plus etoposide and atezolizumab in extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC).MethodsThis retrospective, multicenter study enrolled ES-SCLC patients receiving carboplatin plus etoposide and atezolizumab, categorized into G-CSF and non-G-CSF groups. Demographic and disease-related data were collected. Response rates, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and toxicity were analyzed.ResultsOf 119 patients (median age: 63 years), the overall response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) were 72.3% and 81.5%, respectively. In the G-CSF group, the ORR was 76.4% compared to 60.0% in the non-G-CSF group (p = 0.33), and the DCR was 85.4% versus 70.0%, respectively (p = 0.46). Median PFS was 8.3 months (95% CI, 6.8-9.8) in the G-CSF group and 6.8 months (95% CI, 6.2-7.5) in the non-G-CSF group (p = 0.24). Median OS was 13.8 months (95% CI, 9.6-18.1) for the G-CSF group and 10.6 months (95% CI, 7.9-13.3) for the non-G-CSF group (p = 0.47). Grade 3 >= adverse events were similar between groups (49.4% vs. 33.3%, respectively, p = 0.12).ConclusionG-CSF prophylaxis can be safely used in ES-SCLC patients undergoing carboplatin plus etoposide and atezolizumab regimen without significantly altering efficacy or increasing toxicity.

TI  - Treating patients with platinum-sensitive extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer in a real-world setting
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) is an aggressive disease with poor 5-year survival. The first-line standard-of-care for ES-SCLC is platinum plus etoposide, along with 1 of the immune checkpoint inhibitors atezolizumab or durvalumab. Although SCLC first-line therapy often leads to rapid responses, treatment becomes more challenging at progression, particularly for those with a chemotherapy-free interval (CTFI) of <= 6 months. The NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines (R)) for SCLC no longer specify treatment recommendations in this setting, but options approved by the US Food and Drug Administration include topotecan and lurbinectedin. Participation in a clinical trial is recommended as an option regardless of CTFI. Other NCCN-recommended regimens are paclitaxel, irinotecan, temozolomide, and cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/vincristine, among others. Nivolumab and pembrolizumab are options in those not previously treated with a checkpoint inhibitor. For patients with platinum-sensitive SCLC (CTFI >6 months), preferred treatment per the NCCN Guidelines (R) for SCLC is retreatment with platinum and etoposide, although the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors is discouraged if there is progression on a drug in this class. Further research on immunotherapies and combination regimens is ongoing, and continuing work on the subcharacterization of SCLC may lead to better precision of therapies that promote more durable responses in individual patients with ES-SCLC.

TI  - The Strategies and Mechanisms of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors for Brain Metastases in NSCLC
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Brain metastases are more and more common among patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). TKI therapy could provide ideal outcomes for patients harboring epidermal growth factor receptor or ALK mutations. For wild-type patients, however, survival is poor because there are few effective treatments other than radiotherapy. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have changed the management of advanced NSCLC. However, the exclusion of patients with active brain metastasis (BM) from most ICI trials precludes the generalization of results. Accordingly, a variety of appropriate real-world studies and clinical trials are being developed to evaluate tumor response. Increasingly encouraging results have suggested that ICIs could be active in the central nervous system (CNS) in select patients with high PD-L1 expression and low CNS disease burden. With the extensive use of ICIs in NSCLC patients with BM, many important questions have emerged concerning issues such as the clinical response to a single ICI, use of ICIs combined with chemotherapy or radiation, the biological mechanism and appropriate sequencing of local and systemic therapy combinations, and safety and toxicity. The present review summarizes the advances in systemic ICIs for the treatment of NSCLC patients with BM, discusses factors associated with efficacy and toxicity, and explores future directions.

M3  - Article
AB  - Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for 15% of lung cancers. Only one-third of patients are diagnosed at limited stage. The median survival remains to be around 15-20 months without significative changes in the strategies of treatment for many years. In stage I and IIA, the standard treatment is the surgery followed by adjuvant therapy with platinum-etoposide. In stage IIB-IIIC, the recommended treatment is early concurrent chemotherapy with platinum-etoposide plus thoracic radiotherapy followed by prophylactic cranial irradiation in patients without progression. However, in the extensive stage, significant advances have been observed adding immunotherapy to platinum-etoposide chemotherapy to obtain a significant increase in overall survival, constituting the new recommended standard of care. In the second-line treatment, topotecan remains as the standard treatment. Reinduction with platinum-etoposide is the recommended regimen in patients with sensitive relapse (>= 3 months) and new drugs such as lurbinectedin and immunotherapy are new treatment options. New biomarkers and new clinical trials designed according to the new classification of SCLC subtypes defined by distinct gene expression profiles are necessary.

M3  - Review
AB  - Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is characterized by rapid growth and high metastatic capacity. It has strong epidemiologic and biologic links to tobacco carcinogens. Although the majority of SCLCs exhibit neuroendocrine features, an important subset of tumors lacks these properties. Genomic profiling of SCLC reveals genetic instability, almost universal inactivation of the tumor suppressor genes TP53 and RB1, and a high mutation burden. Because of early metastasis, only a small fraction of patients are amenable to curative-intent lung resection, and these individuals require adjuvant platinum-etoposide chemotherapy. Therefore, the vast majority of patients are currently being treated with chemoradiation with or without immunotherapy. In patients with disease confined to the chest, standard therapy includes thoracic radiotherapy and concurrent platinum-etoposide chemotherapy. Patients with metastatic (extensive-stage) disease are treated with a combination of platinum-etoposide chemotherapy plus immunotherapy with an anti-programmed death-ligand 1 monoclonal antibody. Although SCLC is initially very responsive to platinum-based chemotherapy, these responses are transient because of the development of drug resistance. In recent years, the authors have witnessed an accelerating pace of biologic insights into the disease, leading to the redefinition of the SCLC classification scheme. This emerging knowledge of SCLC molecular subtypes has the potential to define unique therapeutic vulnerabilities. Synthesizing these new discoveries with the current knowledge of SCLC biology and clinical management may lead to unprecedented advances in SCLC patient care. Here, the authors present an overview of multimodal clinical approaches in SCLC, with a special focus on illuminating how recent advancements in SCLC research could accelerate clinical development.

TI  - American Radium Society Appropriate Use Criteria on Radiation Therapy for Extensive-Stage SCLC

M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The standard-of-care therapy for extensive-stage SCLC has recently changed with the results of two large randomized trials revealing improved survival with the addition of immunotherapy to first-line platinum or etoposide chemotherapy. This has led to a lack of clarity around the role of consolidative thoracic radiation and prophylactic cranial irradiation in the setting of chemoimmunotherapy.Methods: The American Radium Society Appropriate Use Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guidelines include a review and analysis of current evidence with the application of consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of treatments recommended by the panel for extensive-stage SCLC.Results: Current evidence supports either prophylactic cranial irradiation or surveillance with magnetic resonance imaging every 3 months for patients without evidence of brain metastases. Patients with brain metastases should receive whole-brain radiation with a recommended dose of 30 Gy in 10 fractions. Consolidative thoracic radiation can be considered in selected cases with the recommended dose ranging from 30 to 54 Gy; this recommendation was driven by expert opinion owing to the limited strength of evidence, as clinical trials addressing this question remain ongoing.Conclusions: Radiation therapy remains an integral component in the treatment paradigm for ES-SCLC.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of thoracic radiotherapy in extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer patients receiving first-line immunotherapy plus chemotherapy: a propensity score matched multicentre retrospective analysis
T2  - RADIATION ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundPlatinum-etoposide chemotherapy combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has been recommended as the first-line standard treatment for extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). However, the effect of thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) on these patients is still unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TRT for ES-SCLC patients who responded to first-line ICIs and chemotherapy (CHT).MethodsPatients who received 4 to 6 cycles of ICIs and CHT as first-line therapy at three hospitals between 2018 and 2022 were included in the analysis. All patients were divided into two groups based on whether they received TRT as first-line treatment, and propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to ensure that the characteristics of two groups were well-balanced. The primary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), and the secondary endpoint was toxic effects.ResultsA total of 276 patients were included, and the median follow-up time was 22.3 (range, 4.0-53.73) months. After PSM, 197 patients were further analysed, and 99 of whom received TRT. The baseline characteristics were well-balanced between patients in the TRT and non-TRT groups. There were significant differences in PFS between the TRT and non-TRT groups, with the median PFS of 10.76 and 7.63 months, respectively (P = 0.014). Significantly improved OS was observed in the TRT group (21.67 vs. 16.6 months, P = 0.009). In addition, the use of TRT was an independent prognostic factor for PFS and OS of ES-SCLC patients receiving ICIs plus CHT. In terms of safety, no significant increase of any grades adverse event (AE) (P = 0.874) and G3-4 AE (P = 0.909) was observed for patients receiving TRT. Radiation esophagitis, gastrointestinal and hematologic toxicities were the most common AEs in TRT group, which were tolerable. And high-dose radiotherapy was associated with higher incidence of pneumonitis.ConclusionAddition of TRT showed significant survival benefits and well tolerability in ES-SCLC patients receiving platinum-etoposide CHT and ICIs, which could be a feasible first-line treatment strategy for ES-SCLC patients.

TI  - A case report of sustained clinical remission in patients with locally advanced lung adenocarcinoma after sequential immunotherapy following concurrent chemoradiotherapy
T2  - ANNALS OF PALLIATIVE MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Pathologically, lung cancer can be non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or small cell lung cancer (SCLC), while NSCLC accounts for approximately 85% of lung cancer patients. Stage III NSCLC represents a heterogeneous group of disease entities that are potentially curable and are usually dealt with multimodality treatments involving radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and surgical resection. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) target programmed cell death receptor-1 (PD-1) and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). Studies have shown that ICIs have excellent and long-lasting anti-cancer effects in many cancers. The PACIFIC study is the first in the systemic treatment of stage III unresectable NSCLC in the past few decades that both progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) have obtained positive results, However, the performance of this treatment strategy remains to be studied in a real-world setting. Such as who will benefit from treatment is still worthy of our continuous exp loration. In this paper, a patient with locally advanced unresectable NSCLC who underwent concurrent chemoradiotherapy followed by sequential immunotherapy (durvalumab) was reported. The patient obtained sustained clinical benefits despite low PD-L1 expression. This case report may serve as a reference for clinicians to make diagnostic and treatment decisions in clinical practice.

TI  - Radiation combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors for unresectable locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer: synergistic mechanisms, current state, challenges, and orientations
T2  - CELL COMMUNICATION AND SIGNALING
M3  - Review
AB  - Until the advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), definitive radiotherapy (RT) concurrently with chemotherapy was recommended for unresectable, locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC). The trimodality paradigm with consolidation ICIs following definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy has been the standard of care since the PACIFIC trial. Preclinical evidence has demonstrated the role of RT in the cancer-immune cycle and the synergistic effect of RT combined with ICIs (iRT). However, RT exerts a double-edged effect on immunity and the combination strategy still could be optimized in many areas. In the context of LA-NSCLC, optimized RT modality, choice, timing, and duration of ICIs, care for oncogenic addicted tumors, patient selection, and novel combination strategies require further investigation. Targeting these blind spots, novel approaches are being investigated to cross the borders of PACIFIC. We discussed the development history of iRT and summarized the updated rationale for the synergistic effect. We then summarized the available research data on the efficacy and toxicity of iRT in LA-NSCLC for cross-trial comparisons to eliminate barriers. Progression during and after ICIs consolidation therapy has been regarded as a distinct resistance scenario from primary or secondary resistance to ICIs, the subsequent management of which has also been discussed. Finally, based on unmet needs, we probed into the challenges, strategies, and auspicious orientations to optimize iRT in LA-NSCLC. In this review, we focus on the underlying mechanisms and recent advances of iRT with an emphasis on future challenges and directions that warrant further investigation. Taken together, iRT is a proven and potential strategy in LA-NSCLC, with multiple promising approaches to further improve the efficacy.

TI  - Vaccine for Targeted Therapy of Lung Cancer: Advances and Developments
T2  - CURRENT DRUG TARGETS
M3  - Review
AB  - Considering that lung cancer is a leading global perpetrator, novel treatment approaches must be investigated. Due to the broad spectrum of lung cancer, conventional therapies including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgeries, are not always effective and can have adverse consequences. The present study's overarching objective was to enhance the development of a personalized vaccine for targeted lung cancer therapy. Vaccination functions by eliciting a strong and targeted immune response defense by taking advantage of the specific antigens that are expressed by lung cancer cells. Crucial antigens associated with tumor cells have been identified with the recognition of the genetic and immunological circumstances of lung cancer in this review. The vaccine includes these antigens to prime the immune system, directing it toward recognizing and attacking cancerous cells. In this review, we have addressed the possible benefits of a targeted vaccine strategy, which include a reduction in off-target effects and an improvement in health outcomes for patients. These studies highlight the promise of a tailored vaccine in a novel way for the treatment of lung cancer. The integration of molecular profiling and immunological insights offers a rationale for the design and implementation of personalized vaccines. While challenges exist, the promise of improved treatment outcomes and reduced side effects positions targeted vaccine therapy as a compelling avenue for advancing lung cancer treatment.

TI  - Effect of immune checkpoint inhibitors at different treatment time periods on prognosis of patients with extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer
T2  - CLINICAL & TRANSLATIONAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The application of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in treating patients with extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) has brought us new hope, but the real-world outcome is relatively lacking. Our aim was to investigate the clinical use, efficacy, and survival benefit of ICIs in ES-SCLC from real-world data analysis. Methods A retrospective analysis of ES-SCLC patients was conducted between 2012 and 2022. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were assessed between groups to evaluate the value of ICIs at different lines of treatment. PFS1 was defined as the duration from initial therapy to disease progression or death. PFS2 was defined as the duration from the first disease progression to the second disease progression or death. Results One hundred and eighty patients with ES-SCLC were included. We performed landmark analysis, which showed that compared to the second-line and subsequent-lines ICIs-combined therapy group (2SL-ICIs) and non-ICIs group, the first-line ICIs-combined therapy group (1L-ICIs) prolonged OS and PFS1. There was a trend toward prolonged OS in the 2SL-ICIs group than in the non-ICIs group, but the significance threshold was not met (median OS 11.94 months vs. 11.10 months, P = 0.14). A longer PFS2 was present in the 2SL-ICIs group than in the non-ICIs group (median PFS2 4.13 months vs. 2.60 months, P < 0.001). Conclusion First-line ICIs plus chemotherapy should be applied in clinical practice. If patients did not use ICIs plus chemotherapy in first-line therapy, the use of ICIs in the second line or subsequent lines of treatment could prolong PFS2.

T2  - CHINESE MEDICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Review
AB  - Immunotherapy has dramatically altered the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. Currently, the emergence of combination strategies in immunotherapy has brightened the prospects of improved clinical outcomes and manageable safety profiles in the first/second-line settings. However, sub-optimal response rates are still observed in several clinical trials. Hence, alternative combination models and candidate selection strategies need to be explored. Herein, we have critically reviewed and commented on the published data from several clinical trials, including combined immunotherapy and chemotherapy, anti-angiogenic agents, epidermal growth factor receptor/anaplastic lymphoma kinase tyrosine kinase inhibitors, radiotherapy, and other immune checkpoint inhibitors.

TI  - Pathways to improving combined modality therapy for stage III nonsmall-cell lung cancer
T2  - ANNALS OF ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Recent progress in the fields of molecular biology and immunology has improved survival for patients with advanced disease. There have also been improvements in radiotherapy including more precise targeting, modified fractionation, and the use of newer beams. It is hoped that these tools can be successfully employed to better care for patients with stage III disease.Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths, having caused an estimated 1.6 million deaths worldwide in 2012 [Ferlay J, Soerjomataram I, Dikshit R et al. Cancer incidence and mortality worldwide: sources, methods and major patterns in GLOBOCAN 2012. Int J Cancer 2015; 136: E359-E386].Although the majority of patients are not cured with currently available therapies, there have been significant improvements in stage-specific outcomes over time [Videtic G, Vokes E, Turrisi A et al. The survival of patients treated for stage III non-small cell lung cancer in North America has increased during the past 25 years. In The 39th Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, ASCO 2003, Chicago, IL. Abstract 2557. p. 291]. This review focuses on past progress and ongoing research in the treatment of locally advanced, inoperable nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).In the past, randomized trials revealed advantages to the use of thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) and then, the addition of induction chemotherapy. This was followed by studies that determined concurrent chemoradiotherapy to be superior to sequential therapy. A recent large phase III trial found that the administration of 74 Gy of conventionally fractionated photon-based TRT provided poorer survival than did the standard 60 Gy. However, further research on other methods of applying radiotherapy (hypofractionation, adaptive TRT, proton therapy, and stereotactic TRT boosting) is proceeding and may improve outcomes. The molecular characterization of tumors has provided more effective and less toxic targeted treatments in the stage IV setting and these agents are currently under investigation for earlier stage disease. Similarly, immune-enhancing therapies have shown promise in stage IV disease and are also being tested in the locally advanced setting.For locally advanced, inoperable NSCLC, standard therapy has evolved from TRT alone to combined modality therapy. We summarize the recent clinical trial experience and outline promising areas of investigation in an era of greater molecular and immunologic understanding of cancer care.

AB  - ECOG-ACRIN EA5181 is a phase III prospective, randomized trial that randomizes patients undergoing chemo/radiation for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC) to concomitant durvalumab or no additional therapy, with both arms receiving 1 year of consolidative durvalumab. Radiation dose escalation failed to improve overall survival in RTOG 0617. However, conventionally fractionated radiation to 60 Gy with concomitant chemotherapy is associated with a high risk of local failure (38%-46%). It is hoped that concomitant immunotherapy during chemo/radiation can help decrease the risk of local failure, thereby improving overall survival and progression-free survival with acceptable toxicity. In this article, we review conventional chemo/radiation therapy for LA-NSCLC, as well as the quickly evolving world of immunotherapy in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer and discuss the rationale and study design of EA5181.Implications for Practice This article provides an up-to-date assessment of how immunotherapy is reshaping the landscape of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and how the impact of this therapy is now rapidly moving into the treatment of patients with locally advanced NSCLC who are presenting for curative treatment. This article reviews the recent publications of chemo/radiation as well as those combining immunotherapy with chemotherapy and chemo/radiation, and provides a strategy for improving overall survival of patients with locally advanced NSCLC by using concomitant immunotherapy with standard concurrent chemo/radiation.

M3  - Review
AB  - Stage III non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents a heterogeneous group of disease entities with multimodality treatments. For most patients, platinum-based doublet with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) has become the first-choice treatment over the past decade. Immune checkpoint inhibition has revolutionized the management of metastatic NSCLC; however, no major advances in systemic therapy for Stage III NSCLC have been made. The following report is the case of a patient with unresectable Stage IIIA NSCLC successfully treated with durvalumab. The patient completed 1 year of treatment without interruptions, and disease control has been maintained for more than 20 months since the start of durvalumab.

TI  - Prophylactic cranial irradiation in small cell lung cancer: an update
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of reviewThe current review presents recent updates in the seminal literature of research on prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in small cell lung cancer (SCLC).Recent findingsBrain MRI restaging before the administration of PCI reveals a substantial proportion of brain metastasis in baseline brain metastasis free extensive-stage SCLC (ES-SCLC) and limited-stage SCLC (LS-SCLC). Posthoc analyses from the CASPIAN and IMpower133 trials revealed decreases in brain metastasis rates in ES-SCLC treated with chemoimmunotherapy relative to the brain metastasis rates in ES-SCLC treated with chemotherapy alone. A recent meta-analysis of literature published after the landmark 1999 Auperin meta-analysis confirmed the survival benefit of PCI in LS-SCLC patients. A recent study employing PET before and after PCI demonstrated that hippocampal avoidance -PCI (HA-PCI) preserved the metabolic activity of the hippocampi compared with regular PCI. Two phase III trials evaluating neurocognitive functions after HA-PCI versus PCI have yielded conflicting results. Ongoing clinical trials (MAVERICK, PRIMALung, NRG CC003, NCT04535739, NCT04829708 and NCT03514849) regarding PCI versus MRI surveillance and HA-PCI versus PCI were also discussed.Currently, the indications for PCI in SCLC are under question in the modern MRI era. Result from prospective phase III, MRI staged and MRI monitored RCTs are expected to elucidate the role of PCI in LS-SCLC and ES-SCLC. Preliminary results indicated that adding immunotherapy to chemotherapy may reduce brain metastasis rate in SCLC. Further data to this aspect are warranted to determine the role of PCI in the immuno-chemotherapy era. The future direction for PCI should be the comprehensive integration of personalized patient selection, HA-PCI utilization and potential employment of other neurocognitive preservation strategies.

TI  - Combined treatment of non-small cell lung cancer using radiotherapy and immunotherapy: challenges and updates
T2  - CANCER COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Review
AB  - The efficacy of immunotherapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains unsatisfactory, as the majority of patients either do not experience an objective response or acquire secondary resistance. As a result, several methods to enhance the systemic efficacy of immunotherapy have been investigated, including a large area of active research by combining immunotherapy with radiation therapy (RT). Given the rapidly burgeoning concept of combining immunotherapy and RT for increasing therapeutic benefit, we review the progress in this field thus far and explore further avenues for enhancing this combination. This review commences with a discussion of the only two existing randomized trials (and a pooled analysis) showing that the addition of RT to immunotherapy improves the abscopal response rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival in metastatic NSCLC patients. We then discussed factors and biomarkers that may be associated with a proportionally greater benefit to additional RT, such as low programmed cell death protein ligand 1 (PD-L1) status, tumor mutational burden (TMB), and patient's immune function. Next, the implementation of RT to overcome immunotherapy resistance is discussed, including a mechanistic discussion and methods with which these mechanisms could be exploited. Lastly, the emerging role of low-dose RT is discussed, which may help to overcome inhibitory signals in the tumor stroma that limit T-cell infiltration. Taken together, given the current state of this rapidly expanding realm, these futuristic strategies may be reflected upon to further enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy for a wider group of patients.

TI  - Emerging Therapies for Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy and Immunotherapy
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The current standard of care for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) includes radiation, chemotherapy, and surgery in certain individualized cases. In unresectable NSCLC, chemoradiation has been the standard of care for the past three decades. Local and distant failure remains high in this group of patients, so dose escalation has been studied in both single institution and national clinical trials. Though initial studies showed a benefit to dose escalation, phase III studies examining dose escalation using standard fractionation or hyperfractionation have failed to show a benefit. Over the last 17 years, stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) has shown a high degree of safety and local control for stage I lung cancers and other localized malignancies. More recently, phase I/II studies using SBRT for dose escalation after conventional chemoradiation in locally advanced NSCLC have been promising with good apparent safety. Immunotherapy also offers opportunities to address distant disease and preclinical data suggest immunotherapy in tandem with SBRT may be a rational way to induce an "abscopal effect" although there are little clinical data as yet. By building on the proven concept of conventional chemoradiation for patients with locally advanced NSCLC with a subsequent radiation dose intensification to residual disease with SBRT concurrent with immunotherapy, we hope address the issues of metastatic and local failures. This "quadmodality" approach is still in its infancy but appears to be a safe and rational approach to the improving the outcome of NSCLC therapy.

AB  - Radiotherapy (RT) is a cornerstone in the management of advanced stage III and stage IV non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Despite international guidelines, clinical practice remains heterogeneous. Additionally, the advent of stereotactic ablative RT (SABR) and new systemic treatments such as immunotherapy have shaken up dogmas in the approach of these patients. This review will focus on palliative thoracic RT for NSCLC but will also discuss the role of stereotactic radiotherapy, endobronchial brachytherapy (EBB), the interest of concomitant treatments (chemotherapy and immunotherapy), and the role of RT in lung cancer emergencies with palliative intent.

TI  - Modern therapies of nonsmall cell lung cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED GENETICS
M3  - Review
AB  - Lung cancer (LC), particularly nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), is one of the most prevalent types of neoplasia worldwide, regardless of gender, with the highest mortality rates in oncology. Over the years, treatment for NSCLC has evolved from conventional surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy to more tailored and minimally invasive approaches. The use of personalised therapies has increased the expected efficacy of treatment while simultaneously reducing the frequency of severe adverse effects (AEs). In this review, we discuss established modern approaches, including immunotherapy and targeted therapy, as well as experimental molecular methods like clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) and nanoparticles. These emerging methods offer promising outcomes and shorten the recovery time for various patients. Recent advances in the diagnostic field, including imaging and genetic profiling, have enabled the implementation of these methods. The versatility of these modern therapies allows for multiple treatment options, such as single-agent use, combination with existing conventional treatments, or incorporation into new regimens. As a result, patients can survive even in the advanced stages of NSCLC, leading to increased survival indicators such as overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS).

TI  - Efficacy and Safety of PD-L1 Inhibitors plus Chemotherapy versus Chemotherapy Alone in First-Line Treatment of Extensive-Stage Small-Cell Lung Cancer: A Retrospective Real-World Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Most patients with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) have extensive-stage (ES) disease with a poor prognosis. Immunotherapy has shown good therapeutic effects in the treatment of ES-SCLC. We performed a real-world retrospective study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PD-L1 inhibitors plus chemotherapy in patients with ES-SCLC. Method. A total of 224 patients diagnosed with ES-SCLC between March 2017 and April 2021 were included, of which 115 received only etoposide-platinum (EP) chemotherapy,and 109 received programmed cell-death ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors and EP. Results. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) plus platinum were associated with a significant improvement in overall survival (OS), with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.60 (95% CI, 0.42-0.85; P=0.0054); median OS was 19 months in the ICIs plus EP group vs. 12 months in the EP group. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 8.5 and 5.0 months, respectively (HR for disease progression or death, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.31-0.57; P < 0.0001). Male patients < 65 years old, Stage IV, PS 0-1, without liver and brain metastasis had a better OS in the ICIs plus EP group than the EP group. The PFS and OS in the durvalumab plus chemotherapy group were insignificantly longer than that of the atezolizumab plus chemotherapy group. Any adverse effects (AEs) of grade 3 or 4 occurred in 50 patients (45.9%) in the ICIs plus EP group and 48 patients (41.7%) in the EP alone group. The most common immune-related AEs (irAEs) were immune hypothyroidism events (17.1%, 7/41), immune dermatitis (9.8%, 4/41), and immune pneumonia (9.8%, 4/41) in the durvalumab plus platinum-etoposide group. Immune liver insufficiency (10.3%, 7/68) and immune hypothyroidism (8.8%, 6/68) were the most common irAEs in the atezolizumab plus platinum-etoposide group. Conclusion. This study shows that adding PD-L1 inhibitors to chemotherapy can significantly improve PFS and OS in patients with ES-SCLC and demonstrates its safety without additional AEs.

TI  - Neoadjuvant durvalumab with or without stereotactic body radiotherapy in patients with early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer: a single-centre, randomised phase 2 trial
T2  - LANCET ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Previous phase 2 trials of neoadjuvant anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 monotherapy in patients with early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer have reported major pathological response rates in the range of 15-45%. Evidence suggests that stereotactic body radiotherapy might be a potent immunomodulator in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In this trial, we aimed to evaluate the use of stereotactic body radiotherapy in patients with early-stage NSCLC as an immunomodulator to enhance the anti-tumour immune response associated with the anti-PD-Ll antibody durvalumab.Methods We did a single-centre, open-label, randomised, controlled, phase 2 trial, comparing neoadjuvant durvalumab alone with neoadjuvant durvalumab plus stereotactic radiotherapy in patients with early-stage NSCLC, at NewYork-Presbyterian and Weill Cornell Medical Center (New York, NY, USA). We enrolled patients with potentially resectable early-stage NSCLC (clinical stages I-IIIA as per the 7th edition of the American joint Committee on Cancer) who were aged 18 years or older with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to either neoadjuvant durvalumab monotherapy or neoadjuvant durvalumab plus stereotactic body radiotherapy (8 Gy x 3 fractions), using permuted blocks with varied sizes and no stratification for clinical or molecular variables. Patients, treating physicians, and all study personnel were unmasked to treatment assignment after all patients were randomly assigned. All patients received two cycles of durvalumab 3 weeks apart at a dose of 1.12 g by intravenous infusion over 60 min. Those in the durvalumab phis radiotherapy group also received three consecutive daily fractions of 8 Gy stereotactic body radiotherapy delivered to the primary tumour immediately before the first cycle of durvalumab. Patients without systemic disease progression proceeded to surgical resection. The primary endpoint was major pathological response in the primary tumour. All analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrial.gov, NCT02904954, and is ongoing but closed to accrual.Findings Between Jan 25, 2017, and Sept 15, 2020, 96 patients were screened and 60 were enrolled and randomly assigned to either the durvalumab monotherapy group (n=30) or the durvalumab plus radiotherapy group (n=30). 26 (87%) of 30 patients in each group had their tumours surgically resected. Major pathological response was observed in two (6.7% [95% CI 0. 8-22- 1]) of 30 patients in the durvalumab monotherapy group and 16 (53.3% [34.3-71.7]) of 30 patients in the durvalumab plus radiotherapy group. The difference in the major pathological response rates between both groups was significant (crude odds ratio 16.0 [95% CI 3- 2-79- 6]; p<0.0001). In the 16 patients in the dual therapy group with a major pathological response, eight (50%) had a complete pathological response. The second cycle of durvalumab was withheld in three (10%) of 30 patients in the dual therapy group due to immune-related adverse events (grade 3 hepatitis, grade 2 pancreatitis, and grade 3 fatigue and thrombocytopaenia). Grade 3-4 adverse events occurred in five (17%) of 30 patients in the durvalumab monotherapy group and six (20%) of 30 patients in the durvalumab plus radiotherapy group. The most frequent grade 3-4 events were hyponatraemia (three 110%1 patients in the durvalumab monotherapy group) and hyperlipasaemia (three [10%] patients in the durvalumab plus radiotherapy group). Two patients in each group had serious adverse events (pulmonary embolism In=11 and stroke [n=1] in the durvalumab monotherapy group, and pancreatitis [n=1] and fatigue [n=1] in the durvalumab plus radiotherapy group). No treatment-related deaths or deaths within 30 days of surgery were reported.Interpretation Neoadjuvant durvalumab combined with stereotactic body radiotherapy is well tolerated, safe, and associated with a high major pathological response rate. This neoadjuvant strategy should be validated in a larger trial. Copyright (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All nghts reserved.

TI  - New developments in locally advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer
T2  - EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Locally advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer, due to its varying prognosis, is grouped according to TNM stage IIIA, IIIB and IIIC. Developments over the last 3 years have been focused on the integration of immunotherapy into the combination treatment of a locally definitive therapy (surgery or radiotherapy) and chemotherapy. For concurrent chemoradiotherapy, consolidation therapy with durvalumab was established. Adjuvant targeted therapy has again gained increasing interest. In order to adapt treatment to the specific stage subgroup and its prognosis, fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography and pathological evaluation of the mediastinum are important. Tumours should be investigated for immunological features and driver mutations. Regarding toxicity, evaluation of pulmonary and cardiac function, as well as symptoms and quality of life, is of increasing importance. To improve the management and prognosis of this heterogeneous entity, clinical trials and registries should take these factors into account.

TI  - Development of immunotherapy for brain metastasis (Review)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Brain metastasis (BM) is associated with a poor prognosis, with the typical overall survival rate ranging from weeks to months in the absence of treatment. Although the concept of immune privilege in the central nervous system has eroded over time, the advent of immunotherapy has opened a new set of potential therapeutic options for patients with BM. Recently, immunotherapy has been demonstrated to confer survival advantages to patients with multiple malignancies commonly associated with BMs. Data from a number of clinical trials have demonstrated that immune checkpoint inhibitors are effective for patients with BM. In addition, cellular therapies, including the application of chimeric antigen receptors T-cell therapy and dendritic cell vaccine, have also been utilized in the treatment of BM. In the present review, preclinical and clinical evidence supporting the applicability of immunotherapy for the treatment of BMs from melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) were examined, where the challenges and safety of this treatment modality were also discussed.

TI  - Clinical Trials Integrating Immunotherapy and Radiation for Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF THORACIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Methods of harnessing the immune system to treat cancer have been investigated for decades, but yielded little clinical progress. However, in recent years, novel drugs that allow immune recognition and destruction of tumor cells are emerging as potent cancer therapies. Building upon previous immunotherapy strategies that included therapeutic vaccines, recombinant cytokines, and other immunostimulatory agents, newer immunotherapy agents targeting immune checkpoints including programmed cell death 1, programmed cell death ligand-1, and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4, among others, have garnered substantial enthusiasm after demonstrating clinical activity in a broad spectrum of tumor types. Trials evaluating immune checkpoint inhibitors in metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) demonstrate robust and durable responses in a subset of patients. However, with overall response rates less than 20%, combinatorial strategies that extend the benefit of these agents to more patients are desirable. The integration of radiotherapy with immunotherapy is a conceptually promising strategy, as radiotherapy has potent immunomodulatory effects and may contribute not only to local control but may also augment systemic antitumor immune response. Preclinical data and case reports suggest the potential for robust clinical responses in metastatic NSCLC patients using this strategy, but prospective clinical trials evaluating the integration of radiation and immunotherapy are limited. The use of immunotherapy in nonmetastatic settings is also intriguing but understudied. We review the potential clinical settings of interest for the partnering of immunotherapy and radiation in NSCLC, including early stage, locally advanced, and metastatic disease, and review completed, accruing, and developing clinical trials.

TI  - Small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the cervix: From molecular basis to therapeutic advances
T2  - BIOMEDICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Review
AB  - Small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the cervix (SCNECC) is an uncommon but aggressive uterine malignancy, the cause of which is generally associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. A lack of clinical trials and evidence-based treatment guidelines poses therapeutic challenges to this rare tumor. At present, published data remain limited to case series and case reports. While clinical management has tradition-ally followed those of small cell neuroendocrine (SCNE) lung cancer relying on surgery, chemoradiation, and systemic chemotherapy, the prognosis remains dismal. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), such as monoclonal antibodies that target programmed death-1 (PD-1) or programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), atezolizumab and durvalumab have proven effective in extensive-stage SCNE lung cancer. Moreover, pembrolizumab has also proven beneficial effects when added onto chemotherapy in metastatic and recurrent HPV-associated non-SCNE cervical cancer. It holds promise to use ICIs in combination with chemoradiation to improve the clinical outcomes of patients with SCNECC. Future ad-vances in our understanding of SCNECC biology -associated with the study of its genomic and molecular aberrations as well as knowledge from SCNE of lung and other extrap-ulmonary sites-would be helpful in discovering new molecular targets for drug devel-opment. Collaborative efforts and establishment of a SCNECC-specific biobank will be essential to achieve this goal.

TI  - Evaluation of the Prognostic Impact of SP263-Evaluated PD-L1 Expression in Patients with Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSLC) Treated with Radio-Chemotherapy
T2  - BIOMEDICINES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The PACIFIC study showed that after radio-chemotherapy, patients with NSCLC derived a benefit in PFS and OS when treated with durvalumab. This effect was limited to patients with a PD-L1 expression of >1%, partly because the outcome in the observational control arm was surprisingly favorable. Thus, it could be speculated that a lack of PD-L1 expression confers a favorable outcome for patients with stage III NSCLC. Methods: Clinical data, PD-L1 expression, predictive blood markers, and the outcomes of 99 homogeneously treated patients with stage III NSCLC were retrospectively captured. Statistical analyses using the log rank test were performed. Results: The median OS of patients with an expression of PD-L1 < 1% was 20 months (CI 10.5-29.5) and the median OS of patients with an expression of PD-L1 >= 1% was 28 months (CI 16.5-39.2) (p = 0.734). The median PFS of patients with an expression of PD-L1 < 1% was 9 months (CI 6.3-11.6) and the median PFS of patients with an expression of PD-L1 >= 1% was 12 months (CI 9.8-14.2) (p = 0.112). Conclusions: The assumption that the lack of PD-L1 expression represents a favorable prognostic factor after radio-chemotherapy vs. PD-L1 expression > 1% was not confirmed.

AB  - Immunotherapy has emerged as an important treatment modality throughout oncology with a particularly important role in the treatment of lung cancer. Early signals showed responses could be achieved in nonsmall cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer and these monoclonal antibodies have become standards of care for advanced stage disease. They have also shown promise in earlier-stage disease as complements to radiation or surgery, offering the potential for durable, meaningful survival gains.

TI  - Out of the darkness and into the light: New strategies for improving treatments for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer
T2  - CANCER LETTERS
M3  - Review
AB  - The standard treatment for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA NSCLC) includes surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or some combination of these modalities. Many clinical trials have been conducted in attempts to intensify treatment for LA NSCLC, but with little improvement. A therapeutic plateau had been reached, with no major progress in extending survival for patients with this disease. However, several recent trials of newer targeted therapies and immunotherapies may shed new light on potential therapeutic breakthroughs. The potential benefits from new targeted therapies and immunotherapies in combination with other forms of therapy for LA NSCLC are sufficiently striking as to change current treatment paradigms. Trials of these agents are moving forward from patients with advanced disease to those with earlier stage disease, and from palliative intent to curative intent, which may well revolutionize treatment strategies that have been considered standard over the past several decades. Future studies are needed to explore the role of targeted therapies and immunotherapies in combination with existing therapies for earlier stage disease and for frontline treatment, either as concurrent or perhaps neoadjuvant or adjuvant approaches.

TI  - Role of radiation in extensive stage small cell lung cancer: a National Cancer Database registry analysis
T2  - FUTURE ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The role of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) and thoracic radiation therapy (TRT) in extensive-stage small cell lung cancer remains controversial. The authors examined the National Cancer Database and identified patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer with no brain metastasis. Patients were excluded if they died 30 days from diagnosis, did not receive polychemotherapy, had other palliative radiation or had missing information. A propensity score-matched analysis was also performed. A total of 21,019 patients were identified. The majority of patients did not receive radiation (69%), whereas 10% received PCI and 21% received TRT. The addition of PCI and TRT improved median survival and survival at 1 and 2 years (p <= 0.05). The propensity score-matched analysis confirmed the same overall survival benefit with both PCI and TRT. This registry-based analysis of >1500 accredited cancer programs shows that PCI and TRT are not commonly utilized for extensive-stage small cell lung cancer patients who are treated with multiagent chemotherapy. The addition of PCI and TRT significantly improves overall survival in this otherwise poor prognostic group. Further research is needed to confirm the role of PCI and TRT, especially in the era of improved systemic therapy.Lay abstractThe role of radiation therapy in patients with metastatic small cell lung cancer remains controversial.

TI  - A Canadian Perspective on the Challenges for Delivery of Curative-Intent Therapy in Stage III Unresectable Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
T2  - CURRENT ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) comprises a highly heterogenous group of patients with regards to patient fitness and tumour size and distribution, resulting in a wide range of treatment goals and therapy options. Curative-intent multimodality treatment should be considered in all patients with stage III NSCLC. For patients with unresectable disease who are fit, have adequate lung function, and have a disease that can be encompassed within a radical radiation volume, concurrent chemoradiation therapy (cCRT) is the standard of care and can produce cure rates of 20-30%. Recently, consolidation immunotherapy with durvalumab has been recognized as the standard of care following cCRT based on significant improvement rates in overall survival at 4 years. The large heterogeneity of the stage III NSCLC population, along with the need for extensive staging procedures, multidisciplinary care, intensive cCRT, and now consolidation therapy makes the delivery of timely and optimal treatment for these patients complex. Several logistical, communication, and education factors hinder the delivery of guideline-recommended care to patients with stage III unresectable NSCLC. This commentary discusses the potential challenges patients may encounter at different points along their care pathway that can interfere with delivery of curative-intent therapy and suggests strategies for improving care delivery.

AB  - Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is characterized by its initial responsiveness to chemotherapy and the appearance of early metastases. Although combination chemotherapy, in some instances together with radiation, has improved the prognosis of this disease, in most patients SCLC ultimately recurs in a drug-resistant form. Several new strategies for the eradication of SCLC are being explored at the preclinical level. The identification of selective target molecules on the surface of SCLC cells, together with the progress made in antibody engineering, have provided new generations of antibodies and immunoconjugates as well as growth factor antagonists and inhibitors. In addition, recent advances in understanding the biology of SCLC have stimulated new investigations searching to counter the molecular basis underlying the increased proliferation and the apoptosis deficiency of SCLC cells. This can be achieved using antisense oligodeoxynucleotides that repress the expression of growth factor receptors and anti-apoptosis genes, or by gene replacement to compensate for the loss or inactivation of tumor suppressor genes.

T2  - DISCOVER ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveTo investigate the role of consolidative thoracic radiation (TRT) in extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) receiving first-line chemo-immunotherapy followed by immunotherapy maintenance.Patients and methodsOutcomes of patients without disease progression after first-line chemotherapy were retrospectively reviewed (January 2020 to December 2021). Based on TRT or not, patients were allocated to TRT group or non-TRT group. Progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and local-recurrence free survival (LRFS) were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by log-rank test.ResultsOf 100 patients, 47 received TRT and 53 non-TRT. The median follow-up was 20.3 months. The median PFS and OS in TRT were 9.1 months and 21.8 months, versus 8.8 months (p = 0.93) and 24.3 months (p = 0.63), respectively, in non-TRT. The median LRFS time in TRT was not reached, but significantly longer than 10.8 months in non-TRT (HR = 0.27, p < 0.01). Second-line chemotherapy significantly prolonged survival compared to that with chemo-free patients (mOS: 24.5 vs. 21.4 months, p = 0.026). The subgroup analysis showed a trend of patients with brain metastases benefit from TRT (21.8 versus 13.7 months, HR 0.61, p = 0.38) while liver metastases did not. Of 47 patients with TRT, only 10.6% of patients experienced grade 3 radiation-induced pneumonitis, while no grade 4 or 5 adverse events occurred.ConclusionConsolidative TRT in the period of immunotherapy maintenance followed first-line chemo-immunotherapy did not prolong OS and PFS but associated with improved LRFS in ES-SCLC.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of anti-PD-1 inhibitor versus anti-PD-L1 inhibitor in first-line treatment of extensive-stage small cell lung cancer: a multicenter retrospective study
T2  - BMC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundImmunotherapy targeting PD-1/PD-L1 has revolutionized the treatment of extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). However, clinical trials suggest differential efficacy of anti-PD-1 agents and anti-PD-L1 agents in first-line treatment of ES-SCLC. This retrospective multicenter study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of anti-PD-1 agents versus anti-PD-L1 agents in first-line treatment of ES-SCLC in real-world practice.MethodsPatients with pathologically or cytologically confirmed ES-SCLC treated with platinum plus etoposide combined with anti-PD-1 or PD-L1 agents as first-line treatment in different centers of PLA General Hospital between January 2017 and October 2021 were included for this study. Survival outcomes and safety were compared between patients receiving anti-PD-1 and PD-L1 agents.ResultsOf the total 154 included patients, 68 received anti-PD-1 agents plus chemotherapy (PD-1 group), and 86 received anti-PD-L1 agents plus chemotherapy (PD-L1 group). Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in the entire cohort were 7.6 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.5-8.2 months) and 17.4 months (95% CI: 15.3-19.3 months), respectively. Median PFS and OS were comparable between the PD-1 group and PD-L1 group (PFS: 7.6 months vs. 8.3 months, HR = 1.13, 95% CI: 0.79-1.62, p = 0.415; OS: 26.9 months vs. 25.6 months, HR = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.63-1.47, p = 0.859. The objective response rate and disease control rate were comparable between the two groups: 79.4% vs. 79.1% and 92.6% vs. 94.2%, respectively. The 6-month, 12-month, and 18-month PFS and OS rates were slightly higher in the PD-L1 group than in the PD-1 group, while the 24-month PFS rate was slightly higher in the PD-1 group than in the PD-L1 group. Stratified analysis showed that locoregional thoracic radiotherapy and normal lactate dehydrogenase level were independent predictors of better OS in ES-SCLC patients treated with first-line chemotherapy plus ICI. Adverse events were not significantly different between the two groups.ConclusionsAnti-PD-1 agents and anti-PD-L1 agents combined with chemotherapy as first-line treatment for ES-SCLC are comparably effective and well tolerated.

TI  - Breaking the Impasse Advances in Treatment of Small Cell Lung Cancer
T2  - CLINICS IN CHEST MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive malignancy and carries a poor prognosis with limited effective treatments in the advanced setting. SCLC is characterized by a high tumor mutation burden and alterations in Notch signaling and DNA damage repair pathways, providing rationale for the use of immunotherapy and targeted therapies. Immunotherapies have led to the most significant advances in treating SCLC in decades, and several promising targeted approaches have emerged from the increased understanding of the biology of SCLC. However, responses to these novel approaches are far from universal, and efforts to refine these therapies are ongoing.

TI  - Is immunotherapy at reduced dose and radiotherapy for older patients with locally advanced non-small lung cancer feasible?-a narrative review by the international geriatric radiotherapy group
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Background and Objective The standard of care for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is either surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy or concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy. However, older patients (70 years old or above) with multiple co-morbidities may not be able to tolerate the combined treatment due to its toxicity. Since lung cancer prevalence increases significantly with age, a new algorithm needs to be investigated to allow curative treatment for those with locally advanced disease.Methods: A literature search of the literature was conducted through PubMed and Google Scholar using search terms such as locally advanced NSCLC, older cancer patients, immunotherapy with check point inhibitors (CPI), and image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT). Abstracts were screened, full articles fitting the article topic were reviewed, and duplicated and non-English articles were excluded.Key Content and Findings: Recently, CPI has been introduced and proven effective for selected patients with increased program death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression (50% or above). A reduced dose for CPI (RDCPI) may be as effective as a full dose and may decrease treatment cost. New radiation technique such as IGRT may also minimize radiotherapy complication through normal lung and cardiac sparing.Conclusions: IGRT and RDCPI may be an innovative option for older patients with locally advanced NSCLC and high PD-L1 expression and needs to be investigated in future prospective studies.

TI  - Immunotherapy in NSCLC Patients with Brain Metastases
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - Approximately 40% of unselected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients develop brain metastases (BMs) during their disease, with considerable morbidity and mortality. The management of BMs in patients with NSCLC is a clinical challenge and requires a multidisciplinary approach to gain effective intracranial disease control. Over the last decade, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have emerged as a game-changer in the treatment landscape of advanced NSCLC, with significant improvements in survival outcomes, although patients with BMs are mostly underrepresented in randomized clinical trials. Moreover, the safety and activity of ICIs and radiotherapy combinations compared with single-agent or sequential modalities is still under evaluation to establish the optimal management of these patients. The aim of this review is to summarize the state-of-the-art of clinical evidence of ICIs intracranial activity and the main challenges of incorporating these agents in the treatment armamentarium of NSCLC patients with BMs.

TI  - The changing landscape of stage III lung cancer: a literature review
T2  - EXPERT REVIEW OF ANTICANCER THERAPY
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction The treatment of stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains challenging and associated with overall poor outcomes. Since seminal studies in the early 90s introduced concurrent chemo-radiotherapy as standard of care for treatment of this disease, no major advances have been introduced in this landscape. Both radiation dose escalation and neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy strategies were unsuccessful to improve the survival over standard of care radiation dose and chemotherapy schedule: five-year overall survival (OS) ranging from 15-20%. However, in 2017 the PACIFIC Trial demonstrated that the addition of consolidative immune checkpoint inhibitor durvalumab for 1 year led to superior progression-free survival (PFS) and 3-year overall survival with no significant increase in toxicity compared to placebo in patients who achieved disease control with concurrent chemo-RT. Areas covered This article reviews the treatment evolution of stage III NSCLC over the past decades, discusses current standard of care strategies, and highlights potential future directions for the management of this condition. Expert opinion Ongoing trials incorporating upfront checkpoint inhibitors with radiotherapy will answer whether adding checkpoint inhibitors to chemotherapy or substituting them for chemotherapy altogether will improve long-term outcome.

M3  - Review
AB  - Optimal management of patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer remains challenging in the context of this heterogeneous disease. Despite aggressive therapeutic approaches, survival benefits are still unsatisfactory for what might be viewed as a localized malignancy. A combined modality approach offers patients superior outcomes, especially because technological advances and refined surgical procedures now provide better results with fewer complications. Nevertheless, several features of therapy remain controversial and lack formal prospective data. Traditional cytotoxic chemoradiation therapy may have reached a plateau and future perspectives opting to integrate molecularly targeted agents and immunotherapy might be the way to improve outcomes in this disease subset.

TI  - Radiotherapy for Oligometastatic Lung Cancer
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) typically presents at an advanced stage, which is often felt to be incurable, and such patients are usually treated with a palliative approach. Accumulating retrospective and prospective clinical evidence, including a recently completed randomized trial, support the existence of an oligometastatic disease state wherein select individuals with advanced NSCLC may experience historically unprecedented prolonged survival with aggressive local treatments, consisting of radiotherapy and/or surgery, to limited sites of metastatic disease. This is reflected in the most recent AJCC staging subcategorizing metastatic disease into intra-thoracic (M1a), a single extra thoracic site (M1b), and more diffuse metastases (M1c). In the field of radiation oncology, recent technological advances have allowed for the delivery of very high, potentially ablative, doses of radiotherapy to both intra-and extra-cranial disease sites, referred to as stereotactic radiosurgery and stereotactic body radiotherapy (or SABR), in much shorter time periods compared to conventional radiation and with minimal associated toxicity. At the same time, significant improvements in systemic therapy, including platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, molecular agents targeting oncogene-addicted NSCLC, and immunotherapy in the form of checkpoint inhibitors, have led to improved control of micro-metastatic disease and extended survival sparking newfound interest in combining these agents with ablative local therapies to provide additive, and in the case of radiation and immunotherapy, potentially synergistic, effects in order to further improve progression-free and overall survival. Currently, despite the tantalizing potential associated with aggressive local therapy in the setting of oligometastatic NSCLC, well-designed prospective randomized controlled trials sufficiently powered to detect and measure the possible added benefit afforded by this approach are desperately needed.

TI  - Identification of Potential Prognostic and Predictive Immunological Biomarkers in Patients with Stage I and Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC): A Prospective Exploratory Study
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Over the last 5 years, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are increasingly used in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) as either monotherapy or in combination with chemo- and/or radiotherapy. However, despite these advances, outcome still remains poor for most patients and there is still a lot of room to improve prognosis in these patients. To date, we have no tools that allow us to identify the patients that will benefit from chemo- and/or radiotherapy combined with immunotherapy, what treatment-induced immune changes can be expected, and what are the most optimal treatment combinations. Therefore, prognostic and predictive immunological biomarkers are urgently needed. This prospective exploratory study aimed to identify potential prognostic and predictive immune-related proteins that are associated with progression-free survival in patients with stage I/III NSCLC. The results of this trial provide a good starting point to implement blood-based immune profiling analyses in future clinical trials. Radiotherapy (RT) and chemotherapy can induce immune responses, but not much is known regarding treatment-induced immune changes in patients. This exploratory study aimed to identify potential prognostic and predictive immune-related proteins associated with progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In this prospective study, patients with stage I NSCLC treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy (n = 26) and patients with stage III NSCLC treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (n = 18) were included. Blood samples were collected before (v1), during (v2), and after RT (v3). In patients with stage I NSCLC, CD244 (HR: 10.2, 95% CI: 1.8-57.4) was identified as a negative prognostic biomarker. In patients with stage III NSCLC, CR2 and IFNGR2 were identified as positive prognostic biomarkers (CR2, HR: 0.00, 95% CI: 0.00-0.12; IFNGR2, HR: 0.04, 95% CI: 0.00-0.46). In addition, analysis of the treatment-induced changes of circulating protein levels over time (Delta v2/v3-v1) also identified CXCL10 and IL-10 as negative predictive biomarkers (CXCL10, HR: 3.86, 95% CI: 1.0-14.7; IL-10, HR: 16.92 (2.74-104.36)), although serum-induced interferon (IFN) response was a positive prognostic. In conclusion, we identified several circulating immunogenic proteins that are correlated with PFS in patients with stage I and stage III NSCLC before and during treatment.

T2  - CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Lung cancer is the highest cause of mortality from cancer worldwide. Most patients present with disease not suitable for curative therapeutic options. In these patients, radiation therapy provides durable palliation of symptoms due to intrathoracic disease, whereas systemic chemotherapy improves survival compared with best supportive care. Over recent years the systemic therapeutic options available for the non-curative management of advanced lung cancer, particularly non-small cell lung cancer, have expanded to include molecularly targeted agents and immune modulating agents. The aim of this overview is to review the role and future of radiation therapy in this era of increasing systemic therapy options with particular emphasis on how radiation therapy can be used to improve therapeutic outcomes.

TI  - Challenges and opportunities in the immunotherapy era: balancing expectations with hope in small-cell lung cancer
T2  - THERAPEUTIC ADVANCES IN MEDICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a biologically aggressive subtype of lung cancer, a lethal disease characterized by rapid tumor growth, early relapse, a strong tendency for early widespread metastasis, and high genomic instability, making it a formidable foe in modern oncology practice. While the management of non-SCLC has been revolutionized in the era of immunotherapy, progress in SCLC has been more muted. Recent randomized phase III clinical trials have combined programmed death ligand-1 inhibitors to a chemotherapy backbone and demonstrated improved survival; however, the absolute benefit observed is short months. There is an undeniable urgent need for better responses, better agents, novel therapeutic approaches, and more rational, biomarker-driven clinical trials in SCLC. In this review, we discuss the rationale and current understanding of the biology of SCLC in the modern era of immunotherapy, discuss recent advances in front-line immunotherapeutic approaches that have changed clinical practice globally, provide an overview of some of the challenges and limitations that have staggered immune checkpoint blockade in SCLC, and explore some of the novel immunotherapeutic approaches currently being investigated.

TI  - When Should we Irradiate the Primary in Metastatic Lung Cancer?
T2  - CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Metastatic lung cancer encompasses a heterogenous group of patients in terms of burdens of disease, ranging from patients with extensive metastases to those with a limited number of metastatic lesions (oligometastatic disease). Histopathological heterogeneity also exists within two broad categories, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC), portraying different patterns and evolution of disease. Local consolidative therapy to the primary tumour and metastatic sites, including surgery and/or radical dose radiotherapy, is increasingly being used to improve survival outcomes, particularly in the context of oligometastatic disease, with or without the use of molecular targeted therapy and immunotherapy. Recently, randomised studies in oligometastatic NSCLC have shown that local consolidative therapy may confer a survival advantage. This review explores whether treating just the primary tumour with radiotherapy may similarly produce improved clinical outcomes. Such a treatment strategy may carry less potential toxicity than treating multiple sites upfront. The biological rationale behind the potential benefits of treating just the primary in metastatic malignancy is discussed. The clinical evidence of such an approach across tumour sites, such as breast and prostate cancer, is also explored. Then the review focuses on treating the primary in NSCLC and SCLC with radiotherapy, by first exploring patterns of failure in metastatic NSCLC and second exploring evidence on survival outcomes from studies in metastatic NSCLC and SCLC. It is challenging to draw conclusions on the clinical benefit of treating the primary cancer in isolation from the evidence available. This highlights the need to collect data within the ongoing clinical trials on the clinical outcome and toxicity of radiotherapy delivery to primary thoracic disease specifically. This challenge also identifies the need to design future clinical trials to produce randomised evidence for such an approach. (C) 2019 The Royal College of Radiologists. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Among various immunotherapy methods, immunoprecipitation inhibitors have been the most effective medications developed in recent years. At present, more in-depth studies have been conducted for two immune checkpoint inhibitor pathways, programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4), and a variety of medications for those above mentioned.

Patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have localized disease both have 5-year survival rates of 52.2%, whereas patients with metastatic disease have 5-year survival rates of only 3.7%. Traditional anti-cancer therapies (surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy) have limited effectiveness in curbing progression. However, advances in immunology and molecular biology in the past two decades have resulted in improved prognosis for those with SCLC and NSCLC, although novel therapies are still needed to make significant improvements in median overall and progression-free survival rates. Notable progress on the importance of tumor immunology has included work on immune surveillance, antigenic targets, and immune checkpoints. Immunotherapies, including vaccines, which can induce antitumor responses by harnessing the power of the immune system, may help to fill this void, and the cancer vaccine continues to be studied as adjunctive therapy. Here, we review recently reported results from clinical trials as well as the possible future roles of vaccine therapy in the treatment of SCLC and NSCLC patients. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Objective: Multimodality treatment for resectable non-small cell lung cancer has long remained at a therapeutic plateau. Immune checkpoint inhibitors are highly effective in advanced non-small cell lung cancer and promising preoperatively in small clinical trials for resectable non-small cell lung cancer. This large multicenter trial tested the safety and efficacy of neoadjuvant atezolizumab and surgery.Methods: Patients with stage IB to select IIIB resectable non-small cell lung cancer and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0/1 were eligible. Patients received atezolizumab 1200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks for 2 cycles or less followed by resection. The primary end point was major pathological response in patients without EGFR/ALKthorn alterations. Pre- and post-treatment computed tomography, positron emission tomography, pulmonary function tests, and bio-specimens were obtained. Adverse events were recorded by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v.4.0.Results: From April 2017 to February 2020, 181 patients were entered in the study. Baseline characteristics were mean age, 65.1 years; female, 93 of 181 (51%); nonsquamous histology, 112 of 181 (62%); and clinical stages IIB to IIIB, 147 of 181 (81%). In patients without EGFR/ALK alterations who underwent surgery, the major pathological response rate was 20% (29/143; 95% confidence interval, 14-28) and the pathological complete response rate was 6% (8/143; 95% confidence interval, 2-11). There were no grade 4/5 treatment-related adverse events preoperatively. Of 159 patients (87.8%) undergoing surgery, 145 (91%) had pathologic complete resection. There were 5 (3%) intraoperative complications, no intraoperative deaths, and 2 postoperative deaths within 90 days, 1 treatment related. Median disease-free and overall survival have not been reached.Conclusions: Neoadjuvant atezolizumab in resectable stage IB to IIIB non-small cell lung cancer was well tolerated, yielded a 20% major pathological response rate, and allowed safe, complete surgical resection. These results strongly support the further development of immune checkpoint inhibitors as preoperative therapy in locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer.

M3  - Review
AB  - Cancer immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has become a "game changer" in the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Its most clinically important advantage over traditional chemotherapy using cytotoxic agents are its long-term survival benefits, and some advanced NSCLC patients treated with an antibody against programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) have survived for 5 years or longer. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are also potentially useful for earlier-stage NSCLC when used in combination with surgery or radiotherapy. A recent clinical trial has shown that consolidation treatment with an antibody against a ligand of PD-1 (PD-L1) following chemo-radiotherapy significantly improves progression-free survival for patients with locally advanced NSCLC. However, current single-agent treatment with an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody may provide significant survival benefits only in a small subset of patients. PD-L1 expression status on tumor cells is an approved biomarker to predict response to ICIs, but is not enough for optimal patient selection. To improve the therapeutic outcomes, development of novel biomarkers other than PD-L1 expression status is essential. Combination treatment strategies based on blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 may also be promising, and a variety of combinations, such as ICIs plus chemotherapy, are being examined in ongoing clinical trials. Here we review and discuss the current status and future perspectives of immunotherapy with ICIs.

TI  - Immune checkpoint inhibitors in small cell lung cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF THORACIC DISEASE
M3  - Review
AB  - Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a rapidly progressive cancer that often debilitates patients within months of detection and quickly becomes refractory to the limited options of therapy. While SCLC is not generally considered an immunogenic tumor, clinical experience suggests that patients with robust immune response manifesting as paraneoplastic syndrome are more likely to present with limited stage of the disease and tend to have a better prognosis. Monoclonal antibodies targeting critical negative regulators of immune response, so called immune checkpoints, such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed death 1 (PD-1) have expanded the application of immune-based therapies to increasing number of advanced stage cancers. These agents overcome the inhibitory immune signals leading to a heightened immune response against cancer cells. These immune checkpoint inhibitors have established efficacy leading to regulatory approval for their use in many cancer types including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Evaluation of the CTLA-4 inhibitor, ipilimumab and PD-1 inhibitors, nivolumab and pembrolizumab in SCLC have shown encouraging signal but definitive studies are still ongoing. In this review, we discuss the rationale behind the use of checkpoint inhibitors in SCLC, contextualize the results of early trials of immunotherapy agents in SCLC and project the future evolution of this strategy.

M3  - Review
AB  - Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. In the past decade, significant advances have been made in the science of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Screening has been introduced with the goal of early detection. The National Lung Screening Trial found a lung cancer mortality benefit of 20% and a 6.7% decrease in all-cause mortality with the use of low-dose chest computed tomography in high-risk individuals. The treatment of lung cancer has also evolved with the introduction of several lines of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in patients with EGFR, ALK, ROS1, and NTRK mutations. Similarly, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have dramatically changed the landscape of NSCLC treatment. Furthermore, the results of new trials continue to help us understand the role of these novel agents and which patients are more likely to benefit; ICIs are now part of the first-line NSCLC treatment armamentarium as monotherapy, combined with chemotherapy, or after definite chemoradiotherapy in patients with stage III unresectable NSCLC. Expression of programmed cell death protein-ligand 1 in malignant cells has been studied as a potential biomarker for response to ICIs. However, important drawbacks exist that limit its discriminatory potential. Identification of accurate predictive biomarkers beyond programmed cell death protein-ligand 1 expression remains essential to select the most appropriate candidates for ICI therapy. Many questions remain unanswered regarding the proper sequence and combinations of these new agents; however, the field is moving rapidly, and the overall direction is optimistic.

TI  - Brain metastases from non-small cell lung carcinoma: an overview of classical and novel treatment strategies
T2  - REPORTS OF PRACTICAL ONCOLOGY AND RADIOTHERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The development of brain metastases is a common problem in patients diagnosed with non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Technological advances in surgery and radiotherapy have allowed greater local control. Moreover, the emergence of targeted therapies and immunotherapy with greater activity on the central nervous system than classical chemotherapy have given way to new strategies in the treatment of brain metastases. We review the current role of local treatments, surgery and radiotherapy, and the most effective combination strategies with the new systemic treatments. Relevance for patients: Brain metastases frequently occur during the course of NSCLC. In recent years, a range of treatments have appeared, such as targeted treatments or immunotherapy, with greater activity at the brain level than classical chemotherapy. Radiotherapy treatment is also now much more conformal and ablative doses can be delivered to the volume of the metastatic area, providing greater local control and less neurological toxicity. However, surgery is still required in cases where anatomopathological specimens are needed and when compressive effects appear. An important challenge is how to combine these treatments to achieve the best control and minimise patients' neurological impairments, especially because of limited experience with the new target drugs, and the unknown toxicity of the different combinations. Future research should therefore focus on these areas in order to establish the best strategies for the treatment of brain metastases from non-small cell lung cancer. Core tips: In this work, we intend to elucidate the best therapeutic options for patients diagnosed with brain metastases of NSCL, which include: surgery, WBRT, radiosurgery or systemic treatment, and the most effective combinations and timings of them, and the ones with the lowest associated toxicity.

TI  - Pearls and Pitfalls in the Imaging of Targeted Therapy and Immunotherapy in Lung Cancer
T2  - SEMINARS IN ULTRASOUND CT AND MRI
M3  - Article
AB  - Most lung cancers are diagnosed at advanced stage when the cancer has metastasized outside the lung. These patients are not eligible for curative surgery or radiation therapy and treated with systemic therapy. Advances in the understanding of the biology of lung cancer has resulted in the development of targeted therapy aimed at specific genetic mutations identified with non-small cell lung cancer and immunotherapy that helps the immune system recognize tumors as foreign, stimulates the immune system, and removes the inhibition that allows growth and spread of cancer cells. Tumors treated with targeted or immunotherapies respond differently when compared with traditional chemotherapy and not captured by conventional response criteria such as the World Health Organization criteria and Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. Therefore, several modified criteria have been developed to appropriately address the treatment response when using these novel agents. Numerous treatment-related side effects have been described that are important to recognize to avoid misinterpretation as worsening tumor and to ensure appropriate management. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Nationwide Real-Life Safety and Treatment Exposure Data on Durvalumab After Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy in Unresectable Stage III, Locally Advanced, Non-small Cell Lung Cancer: Analysis of Patients Enrolled in the French Early Access Program
T2  - LUNG
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Consolidation immunotherapy with the PD-L1 inhibitor durvalumab following concurrent chemoradiotherapy (cCRT) has shown a significant survival improvement and is now a standard of care in patients with unresectable stage III or non-operable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods In this early access program cohort, demographic, disease characteristics and safety data were collected for 576 patients from 188 centers, who received durvalumab 10 mg/kg intravenous infusion every 2 weeks, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or for a maximum of 12 months following cCRT. Durvalumab exposure data were available for 402 patients. Results Overall, 576 patients were included, 72.9% were men, median age 64.0 years, 52.3% had a stage IIIB disease. PD-L1 status captured in 445 (77%) patients was positive (48.1%), negative (32.6%), unknown (19.3%). At the end of cCRT, adverse events (AEs) all grade <= 2, were reported in 22.7% of patients, mainly esophagitis (6.3%). The main reasons of discontinuation were completion of the planned 12 months of consolidation treatment (42.1% patients), disease progression (28.6%) and adverse events (19.5%). Treatment completion was similar in PDL-1 positive and PDL-1 negative patients groups. 20.7% patients had a SAE drug reaction and 17.7% stopped treatment mainly due to SAE. ADR rate and early treatment discontinuation were higher in patients > 70 years old. Death due to AEs occurred in 7 patients, 2 had interstitial lung disease. Conclusion Safety data with durvalumab consolidation after cCRT in a large cohort of patients with stage III NSCLC are reported in this real-life cohort. Consistent data were reported both in the PD-L1 positive and PD-L1 negative NSCLC patients in daily practice.

TI  - Immunotherapy Moves to the Early-Stage Setting in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: Emerging Evidence and the Role of Biomarkers
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Simple SummaryIn recent years there has been a trend towards an increase in the proportion of non-small cell lung cancer patients diagnosed with localized stage instead of advanced. However, 5-year survival rates continue to be low, even among patients diagnosed at early stages. In recent years major advances have been made in the treatment of advanced NSCLC, in large part due to the irruption of immunotherapy. PD-1 axis blocking-based immunotherapy is already a well-established standard of care treatment for patients with advances NSCLC, in frontline setting and in pretreated patients. Our greatest challenge now is to move the benefit of immunotherapy to patients with early-stage NSCLC so as to increase 5-year survival rate. The aim of this manuscript is to make a comprehensive review of available evidence, make a critical review of the results of published and ongoing studies, and analyze the role of biomarkers, main areas of controversy and future challenges.Despite numerous advances in targeted therapy and immunotherapy in the last decade, lung cancer continues to present the highest mortality rate of all cancers. Targeted therapy based on specific genomic alterations, together with PD-1 and CTLA-4 axis blocking-based immunotherapy, have significantly improved survival in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and both therapies are now well-established in this clinical setting. However, it is time for immunotherapy to be applied in patients with early-stage disease, which would be an important qualitative leap in the treatment of lung cancer patients with curative intent. Preliminary data from a multitude of studies are highly promising, but therapeutic decision-making should be guided by an understanding of the molecular features of the tumour and host. In the present review, we discuss the most recently published studies and ongoing clinical trials, controversies, future challenges and the role of biomarkers in the selection of best therapeutic options.

TI  - Immunotherapy progress and clinical strategy of unresectable locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Non-small cell lung cancer negative for actionable molecular markers entered the splendid era of immunotherapy. This review aims to provide an evidence-based summary for immunotherapy for unresectable locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer, and references for clinical strategies of immunotherapy. Through literature review, the standard treatment for unresectable locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer should be radical concurrent radiotherapy and chemotherapy followed by consolidation immunotherapy. However, the efficacy of concurrent radiotherapy, chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy has not been improved, and its safety should be further validated. It is believed that induction immunotherapy plus concurrent radiotherapy and chemotherapy plus consolidation immunotherapy is promising. In clinical practice, the delineation of radiotherapy target should be relatively small. Pemetrexed combined with PD-1 inhibitor induces the strongest immunogenicity in chemotherapy, which is suggested by preclinical pathway study. Although there is no significant difference between PD1 and PD1 for effect, PD-L1 inhibitor is better in the combination treatment of radiotherapy which presents significantly less adverse events.

TI  - Immune Activation Effects at Different Irradiated Sites and Optimal Timing of Radioimmunotherapy in Patients with Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer: a Real-World Analysis
T2  - BIOLOGICAL PROCEDURES ONLINE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundIn view of the limited data on radiotherapy (RT) combined with immunotherapy in patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC), this study aimed to identify the immune activation effect on different sites and the survival outcomes of radioimmunotherapy at different treatment stages.MethodsForty-five patients diagnosed with ES-SCLC were included in this retrospective analysis. We collected the overall survival (OS) of the patients,, recorded the blood cell counts before, during, and after RT, and derived blood index ratios such as the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and systemic immune-inflammation index (SII). The datasets were analyzed using the Spearman rank correlation test, Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test and logistic regression.ResultsAmong the selected blood indices, the delta-NLR/PLR/Sll correlated with different irradiated organs, and the mean ranks of these three indices were the lowest in the brain-irradiated group during immunotherapy. Additionally, adjunct first-line immunotherapy with RT demonstrated a significant improvement compared to second- or third-line therapy and subsequent therapies.ConclusionOur findings suggest that compared to other organs, the strongest immune activation effect occurs with brain RT, and ES-SCLC patients who received radioimmunotherapy (RIT) earlier achieved higher OS rates.

TI  - Targeted drug therapy in non-small cell lung cancer: Clinical significance and possible solutions-Part I
T2  - EXPERT OPINION ON DRUG DELIVERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) comprises of 84% of all lung cancer cases. The treatment options for NSCLC at advanced stages are chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Chemotherapy involves conventional nonspecific chemotherapeutics, and targeted-protein/receptor-specific small molecule inhibitors. Biologically targeted therapies such as an antibody-based immunotherapy have been approved in combination with conventional therapeutics. Approved targeted chemotherapy is directed against the kinase domains of mutated cellular receptors such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), anaplastic lymphoma kinases (ALK), neurotrophic receptor kinases (NTRK) and against downstream signaling molecules such as BRAF (v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1). Approved biologically targeted therapy involves the use of anti-angiogenesis antibodies and antibodies against immune checkpoints. Areas covered The rationale for the employment of targeted therapeutics and the resistance that may develop to therapy are discussed. Novel targeted therapeutics in clinical trials are also included. Expert opinion Molecular and histological profiling of a given tumor specimen to determine the aberrant onco-driver is a must before deciding a targeted therapeutic regimen for the patient. Periodic monitoring of the patients response to a given therapeutic regimen is also mandatory so that any semblance of resistance to therapy can be deciphered and the regimen may be accordingly altered.

TI  - Progress in radiotherapy for small-cell lung cancer
T2  - PRECISION RADIATION ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly aggressive neuroendocrine tumor that is prone to spread extensively. Compared to non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), SCLC treatment progresses slowly. Although SCLC is highly sensitive to chemotherapy during the initial treatment, most patients still experience resistance and recurrence after receiving chemotherapy. A meta-analysis demonstrated that thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) improves overall survival in SCLC. The results of the CALGB and CONVERT trials provide evidence for the efficacy of once-daily high-dose TRT. TRT at 60 Gy administered twice daily significantly improved survival without increasing toxicity. The long-standing debate over the optimal timing of radiotherapy has not been fully resolved. SBRT has excellent local control rates and is a safe and effective treatment option for patients with stage I or II SCLC. Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) is used to reduce treatment-related neurotoxicity to the extent that there has been a recent discussion on whether magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) monitoring can replace PCI. Radiotherapy combined with immunotherapy significantly improves the survival rate of patients with NSCLC; however, its clinical effectiveness has not been systematically explored in patients with SCLC. Therefore, we summarize the evolving therapeutic strategies, (TRT for limited stage-SCLC and consolidative TRT for extensive stage-SCLC) and improved radiotherapy techniques (role of SBRT in stage I or II node-negative SCLC, progress of PCI, and stereotactic radiosurgery), and discuss the possibilities and prospects of radiotherapy combined with immunotherapy for SCLC.Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly malignant neuroendocrine tumor that is prone to extensive metastasis. Compared to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the overall treatment of SCLC is slow to progress.Therefore, we summarize the new evolving therapeutic strategies (fractionation and dose, sequencing and timing) , improved radiotherapy techniques (progress of PCI and SRS) and discuss the possibilities and prospects of radiotherapy combined with immunotherapy for SCLC. image

TI  - LIBRETTO-432, a phase III study of adjuvant selpercatinib or placebo in stage IB-IIIA <i>RET</i> fusion-positive non-small-cell lung cancer
T2  - FUTURE ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Selpercatinib, a first-in-class, highly selective and potent central nervous system-active RET kinase inhibitor demonstrated clinically meaningful activity with manageable toxicity in pretreated and treatment-naive advanced/metastatic RET fusion-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). LIBRETTO-432 is a global, randomized, double-blind, phase III trial evaluating selpercatinib versus placebo in stage IB-IIIA, RET fusion-positive NSCLC, previously treated with definitive surgery or radiation; participants must have undergone available anti-cancer therapy (including chemotherapy or durvalumab) or not be suitable for it, per investigator's discretion. The primary end point is investigator-assessed event-free survival (EFS) in the primary analysis population (stage II-IIIA RETfusion-positive NSCLC). Key secondary end points include EFS in the overall population, overall survival, and time to distant disease recurrence in the central nervous system.Plain language summary: Selpercatinib is approved in multiple countries for the treatment of advanced or metastatic RET-altered lung cancers. Selpercatinib has shown promising efficacy and safety results in patients with advanced/metastatic RET fusion-positive NSCLC. This is a summary of the LIBRETTO-432 study which compares selpercatinib with placebo in patients with earlier stages (stage IB-IIIA) of RET fusion-positive NSCLC, who have already undergone surgery or radiotherapy and applicable adjuvant chemotherapy. This study is active and currently recruiting new participants. This trial will evaluate how long people live without evidence of cancer recurrence, both during and after treatment. Side effects will also be evaluated in this study.

TI  - Real-world evaluation of first-line treatment of extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer with atezolizumab plus platinum/etoposide: a focus on patients with brain metastasis
T2  - CLINICAL & TRANSLATIONAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeA previous real-world study conducted in China confirmed that first-line atezolizumab, in combination with etoposide/platinum (EP), leads to significantly longer progression-free survival (PFS) compared to EP alone in patients with extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). The present study aimed to provide updated survival outcome data and evaluate the clinical efficacy of atezolizumab plus chemotherapy in ES-SCLC patients with brain metastasis (BM).MethodsThis retrospective study included 225 patients with ES-SCLC who were treated with EP alone (EP group) or a combination of EP + atezolizumab (atezolizumab group). Survival outcomes for the total study sample and patients in the BM subgroup were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.ResultsThe atezolizumab group continued to demonstrate significantly longer PFS than the EP group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.68). The median overall survival (OS) was 26.2 months in the atezolizumab group vs. 14.8 months in the EP group (HR, 0.63). Additionally, among the BM patients in our study, the median PFS was found to be longer in the atezolizumab group (7.0 months) than in the EP group (4.1 months) (HR, 0.46). The OS of the BM patients did not differ significantly between the two treatment groups.ConclusionsThe addition of atezolizumab to EP as a first-line treatment for ES-SCLC was found to improve survival outcomes. This treatment combination may also prolong PFS in patients with BM, regardless of the administration of cranial irradiation. However, among the BM patients in our study, there was no significant difference in OS between the two treatment groups.

TI  - Multidisciplinary Management of Brain Metastases from Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer in the Era of Immunotherapy
T2  - CURRENT TREATMENT OPTIONS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Opinion statement Brain metastases from non-small cell lung cancer often cause neurologic symptoms which lead to initial diagnosis or identification of recurrence. In other patients, they are identified on surveillance imaging or when a patient undergoing treatment develops neurological symptoms. Patients with symptomatic lesions should be started on dexamethasone and evaluated by a neurosurgeon as soon as possible. If feasible, surgery should be offered to decrease intracranial pressure, alleviate symptoms, and prevent irreversible neurological damage. Postoperative stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) to the resection cavity and any additional brain metastases should follow within 4 weeks of surgery, as early as 2 weeks post-op. Tissue from surgery is used to confirm the diagnosis and test for targetable oncogenic driver mutations. Treatment response and surveillance for development of additional lesions is assessed with MRI of the brain 1 month after SRS and every 3 months thereafter. Patients who are not surgical candidates or who have small, asymptomatic brain metastases should proceed with SRS, the preferred treatment, or sometimes whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) if multifocal disease requires more extensive treatment, such as for leptomeningeal spread of disease. The number of brain metastases that warrants use of WBRT over SRS is controversial and a topic of ongoing investigation, and is discussed in this review. When possible, SRS is preferred over WBRT due to reduce morbidity and cognitive side effects. When patients are already on systemic therapy at time of brain metastases diagnosis, systemic therapy should continue, with radiation therapy occurring between cycles. Regarding systemic therapy for new diagnosis at time of brain metastases presentation, molecular testing will guide treatment choice, when available. If there is no neurosurgical intervention, biopsy of another site of disease may provide tissue for molecular testing. If there are no targetable oncogenic driver mutations, concurrent immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) and chemotherapy is preferable for patients who can tolerate it. Single-agent ICB is an alternative option for patients who cannot tolerate chemotherapy. Systemic therapy should start as soon as possible. In some patients with poor performance status, best supportive care may be the most appropriate choice. Treatment decisions should always incorporate patients' goals of care and in many cases should be discussed in a multidisciplinary setting.

TI  - Pembrolizumab in lung cancer: current evidence and future perspectives
T2  - FUTURE ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Pembrolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against PD-1 capable of enhancing antitumor immune activity. The KEYNOTE-001 study showed that pembrolizumab has activity in advanced non-smallcell lung cancer patients and identified programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) as a companion test to select patients most likely to benefit from pembrolizumab. Five randomized clinical trials showed the efficacy of pembrolizumab in non-small-cell lung cancer: in second-line setting PD-L1 >= 1% (KEYNOTE-010), in first-line setting PD-L1 >= 50% (KEYNOTE-024 and KEYNOTE-042) and in first-line setting in combination with platinum doublets, any expression of PD-L1 (KEYNOTE-189 and KEYNOTE-407). Future challenges are the identification of the role of pembrolizumab in adjuvant, neoadjuvant, locally advanced disease or oncogene-addicted patients, in combination with radiotherapy or other biological agents.

TI  - Impact of thoracic radiotherapy on first-line treatment outcomes in ES-SCLC patients
T2  - CANCER MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The therapeutic advantage of thoracic radiotherapy (tRT) as an adjunct to first-line immunotherapy and chemotherapy in patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) remains unclear. We sought to elucidate this in a retrospective cohort study comparing the effectiveness and safety of tRT in combination with first-line immunotherapy and chemotherapy. Methods: Our retrospective study included patients with ES-SCLC, treated at the West China Hospital between January 2019 and December 2022. They received first-line immunotherapy and chemotherapy and were categorized into two cohorts based on the administration of tRT. The primary outcomes were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Cox regression analysis was utilized to identify potential independent predictors of prognosis and to compare the treatment outcomes across various patient subgroups. Treatment-related toxicities across both cohorts were compared using the Chi-squared test. Results: A total of 99patients were eligible for the study, out of which 55 received tRT. The medianduration of follow-up was 39 months. Remarkably, patients who received tRTdemonstrated superior OS and PFS in comparison to those who did not (P < 0.05). Subgroup analysis further confirmed these findings. Multivariate analysisidentified treatment group and liver metastasis as independent prognosticfactors (P < 0.05). The incidence of grade 3-4 adverse events showed nostatistically significant difference between the two cohorts. Conclusions: Thus, weconfirmed that the addition of tRT to the conventional regimen of first-linechemotherapy and immunotherapy yields better survival outcomes without asignificant increase in toxicity.

TI  - Incidence and Risk Factors of Symptomatic Radiation Pneumonitis in Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer Patients Treated with Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy and Consolidation Durvalumab
T2  - CLINICAL LUNG CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Consolidation durvalumab therapy following concurrent chemoradiotherapy is a new standard treatment for unresectable locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. Understanding the risk of radiation pneumonitis (RP) in this setting is important for both radiation treatment planning and the monitoring and management of patients. We found that elevations in lung volume receiving >= 20 Gy increased the RP risk.Introduction: Data on the risk factors for symptomatic radiation pneumonitis (RP) in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) and consolidation durvalumab are limited; we aimed to investigate these risk factors. Materials and Methods: This multicenter retrospective study, conducted at 15 institutions in Japan, included patients who were >= 20 years of age; who started definitive CCRT for NSCLC between July 1, 2018, and July 31, 2019; and who then received durvalumab. The primary endpoint was grade 2 or worse (grade 2+) RP.Results: In the 146 patients analyzed, the median follow-up period was 16 months. A majority of the patients had stage III disease (86%), received radiation doses of 60 to 66 Gy equivalent in 2-Gy fractions (93%) and carboplatin and paclitaxel/nab-paclitaxel (77%), and underwent elective nodal irradiation (71%) and 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (75%). RP grade 2 was observed in 44 patients (30%); grade 3, in four patients (3%); grade 4, in one patient (1%); and grade 5, in one patient (1%). In the multivariable analysis, lung V20 was a significant risk factor, whereas age, sex, smoking history, irradiation technique, and chemotherapy regimen were not. The 12-month grade 2+ RP incidence was 34.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 26.7%-42.1%); the values were 50.0% (95% CI, 34.7%-63.5%) and 27.1% (95% CI, 18.8%-36.2%) in those with lung V20 >= 26% and < 26%, respectively (P=.007). Conclusion: The incidence of grade 2+ RP was relatively high in this multicenter real-world study, and its risk increased remarkably at elevated lung V20. Our findings can aid in RP risk prediction and the safe radiotherapy treatment planning. of grade 2+ RP was relatively high in this multicenter real-world study, and its risk increased remarkably at elevated lung V20. Our findings can aid in RP risk prediction and the safe radiotherapy treatment planning. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
