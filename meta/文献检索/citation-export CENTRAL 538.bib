Safety of MK‐3475 plus radiation for extensive‐stage small‐cell lung cancer (ES‐SCLC). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. MK‐3475 will improve progression free survival (PFS) compared to historical controls for LS‐SCLC and ES‐SCLC. OUTLINE: This is a dose‐escalation study of pembrolizumab. Patients are assigned to either Part A or Part B based on diagnosis. PART A (LS‐SCLC): Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and undergo radiation therapy twice daily (BID) 5 days a week for 3 weeks. Patients also receive cisplatin IV over 2 hours or carboplatin IV over 30 minutes and etoposide IV over 4 hours on days 1, 2, and 3. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 16 courses (1 course for radiation therapy, 4 courses for chemotherapy) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve systemic disease control and do not exhibit severe (grade > 3) pembrolizumab related toxicity during/after completion of 16 courses may receive 16 additional courses of pembrolizumab in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PART B (ES‐SCLC): Beginning after the completion of chemotherapy, patients receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and undergo radiation therapy BID 5 days a week for 3 weeks. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 16 courses (1 course for radiation therapy) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, all patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 12 weeks.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ipilimumab combined with standard first‐line chemotherapy for patients with extensive‐stage SCLC. METHODS: Patients with chemotherapy‐naive extensive‐stage SCLC were treated with carboplatin and etoposide for up to six cycles. Ipilimumab, 10 mg/kg, was given on day 1 of cycles 3 to 6 and every 12 weeks. Response was assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.0, and immune‐related response criteria. The primary end point was 1‐year progression‐free survival (PFS) according to RECIST. Secondary end points included PFS according to immune‐related PFS and overall survival. Autoantibody serum levels were evaluated and correlated with clinical outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 42 patients were enrolled between September 2011 and April 2014; 39 were evaluable for safety and 38 for efficacy. Six of 38 patients (15.8% [95% confidence interval (CI): 7.4‐30.4]) were alive and progression‐free at 1‐year by RECIST. Median PFS was 6.9 months (95% CI: 5.5‐7.9). Median immune‐related PFS was 7.3 months (95% CI: 5.5‐8.8). Median overall survival was 17.0 months (95% CI: 7.9‐24.3). Of the patients evaluable for response, 21 of 29 (72.4%) achieved an objective response by RECIST and 28 of 33 (84.8%) achieved an objective response by the immune‐related response criteria. All patients experienced at least one adverse event; at least one grade 3 or higher toxicity developed in 35 of 39 patients (89.7%); in 27 patients (69.2%) this was related to ipilimumab. Five deaths were reported to be related to ipilimumab. Positivity of an autoimmune profile at baseline was associated with improved outcomes and severe neurological toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Ipilimumab in combination with carboplatin and etoposide might benefit a subgroup of patients with advanced SCLC. Autoantibody analysis correlates with treatment benefit and toxicity and warrants further investigation.},

abstract = {Limited‐stage (LS) small‐cell lung cancer (SCLC) remains an area of high unmet medical need. The standard‐of‐care therapy comprises curative‐intent platinum‐based chemotherapy with concurrent radiotherapy (cCRT), which can be followed by prophylactic brain irradiation and then observation. However, most patients will relapse. Durvalumab (antiprogrammed cell death ligand‐1) has enhanced the efficacy outcomes after cCRT for patients with unresectable, stage III non‐small‐cell lung cancer. Recently, durvalumab combined with platinum‐etoposide demonstrated a significant survival benefit compared with platinum‐etoposide as first‐line treatment of patients with extensive‐stage SCLC and has also shown antitumor activity as monotherapy and combined with tremelimumab (anticytotoxic T‐lymphocyte‐associated antigen‐4) in pretreated patients with extensive‐stage SCLC. ADRIATIC, a phase III, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, multicenter, global study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT03703297), is designed to investigate the efficacy of durvalumab, with or without tremelimumab, as consolidation therapy for patients with LS‐SCLC without disease progression after cCRT. Approximately 600 patients with documented histologic or cytologic LS‐SCLC, World Health Organization/Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 or 1, and no progression after 4 cycles of cCRT will be randomized (1:1:1) to treatment (durvalumab 1500 mg plus placebo every 4 weeks [q4w] for 4 cycles, followed by durvalumab 1500 mg q4w; durvalumab 1500 mg plus tremelimumab 75 mg q4w for 4 cycles, followed by durvalumab 1500 mg q4w; or dual placebo q4w for 4 cycles, followed by single placebo q4w) within 1 to 42 days of completing cCRT, stratified by stage and receipt of prophylactic brain irradiation. The primary endpoints are progression‐free survival and overall survival. The secondary endpoints are overall survival and progression‐free survival rates, objective response rate, and safety and tolerability. Recruitment began in September 2018.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most patients with small‐cell lung cancer (SCLC) have extensive‐stage disease at presentation, and prognosis remains poor. Recently, immunotherapy has demonstrated clinical activity in extensive‐stage SCLC (ES‐SCLC). The CASPIAN trial assessed durvalumab, with or without tremelimumab, in combination with etoposide plus either cisplatin or carboplatin (platinum‐etoposide) in treatment‐naive patients with ES‐SCLC. METHODS: This randomised, open‐label, phase 3 trial was done at 209 sites across 23 countries. Eligible patients were adults with untreated ES‐SCLC, with WHO performance status 0 or 1 and measurable disease as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1. Patients were randomly assigned (in a 1:1:1 ratio) to durvalumab plus platinum‐etoposide; durvalumab plus tremelimumab plus platinum‐etoposide; or platinum‐etoposide alone. All drugs were administered intravenously. Platinum‐etoposide consisted of etoposide 80‐100 mg/m2 on days 1‐3 of each cycle with investigator's choice of either carboplatin area under the curve 5‐6 mg/mL per min or cisplatin 75‐80 mg/m2 (administered on day 1 of each cycle). Patients received up to four cycles of platinum‐etoposide plus durvalumab 1500 mg with or without tremelimumab 75 mg every 3 weeks followed by maintenance durvalumab 1500 mg every 4 weeks in the immunotherapy groups and up to six cycles of platinum‐etoposide every 3 weeks plus prophylactic cranial irradiation (investigator's discretion) in the platinum‐etoposide group. The primary endpoint was overall survival in the intention‐to‐treat population. We report results for the durvalumab plus platinum‐etoposide group versus the platinum‐etoposide group from a planned interim analysis. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of their assigned study treatment. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03043872, and is ongoing. FINDINGS: Patients were enrolled between March 27, 2017, and May 29, 2018. 268 patients were allocated to the durvalumab plus platinum‐etoposide group and 269 to the platinum‐etoposide group. Durvalumab plus platinum‐etoposide was associated with a significant improvement in overall survival, with a hazard ratio of 0·73 (95% CI 0·59‐0·91; p=0·0047]); median overall survival was 13·0 months (95% CI 11·5‐14·8) in the durvalumab plus platinum‐etoposide group versus 10·3 months (9·3‐11·2) in the platinum‐etoposide group, with 34% (26·9‐41·0) versus 25% (18·4‐31·6) of patients alive at 18 months. Any‐cause adverse events of grade 3 or 4 occurred in 163 (62%) of 265 treated patients in the durvalumab plus platinum‐etoposide group and 166 (62%) of 266 in the platinum‐etoposide group; adverse events leading to death occurred in 13 (5%) and 15 (6%) patients. INTERPRETATION: First‐line durvalumab plus platinum‐etoposide significantly improved overall survival in patients with ES‐SCLC versus a clinically relevant control group. Safety findings were consistent with the known safety profiles of all drugs received. FUNDING: AstraZeneca.},

abstract = {Background. Relapsed and refractory small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for about 15% of all lung cancers. The prognosis of patients is poor. The 5‐year survival rate is almost 0. The average survival time of patients who refuse to receive treatment is only 2‐4 months. For patients with extensive‐stage SCLC, the current first‐line treatment regimens are mainly platinum‐containing double‐drug chemotherapy. Poside combined with cisplatin/carboplatin and irinotecan combined with cisplatin/carboplatin are commonly used clinical regimens for the treatment of patients with extensive‐stage SCLC. Although SCLC is very sensitive to radiotherapy and chemotherapy, most patients will develop recurrence and metastasis after initial treatment. Therefore, it is necessary to study clinically effective therapeutic drugs for relapsed and refractory SCLC. Objective. To investigate the relationship between programmed death receptor‐1 (programmed death receptor‐1 (PD‐1)) and programmed death receptor‐ligand 1 (programmed death‐ligand 1 (PD‐L1)) inhibitors and Lung Cancer No. 1 efficacy and safety of Lung Cancer Fang No. 1 in the treatment of relapsed and refractory SCLC. Methods. 80 patients with refractory SCLC were selected and randomly divided into control group and treatment group with 40 cases in each group. Among them, the control group received PD‐1/PD‐L1 inhibitor chemotherapy, and the treatment group received PD‐1/PD‐L1 inhibitor chemotherapy combined with Lung Cancer Fang No. 1 treatment. The differences in immune and tumor marker levels, clinical efficacy, and prognostic complications between the two groups before and after treatment were observed and compared. Results. Before treatment, there was no significant difference in clinical improvement between the two groups. After treatment, the clinical symptom scores and body weight changes in the treatment group were significantly improved. The clinical symptom scores in the treatment group were lower than those in the control group, but the body weight changes were higher than those in the control group. The difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). Before treatment, there was no significant difference in the levels of tumor markers between the two groups. After treatment, the levels of CYFRA21‐1, CA125, and VGEF in the treatment group were significantly lower than those in the control group, and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). There was no significant difference in the immune level between the two groups before treatment (P>0.05), while the differences in CD4+, CD3+, and CD4+/CD8+ after treatment were significant, and the treatment group was higher than the control group, with statistical significance (P<0.05). After treatment, the clinical efficacy of the two groups was significantly improved. The DCR90.00% of the treatment group was significantly higher than that of the control group, 67.50%, and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). The analysis of complications after treatment showed that fatigue, anorexia, hypertension, hand‐foot syndrome, diarrhea, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and urinary protein in the treatment group were significantly lower than those in the control group, and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). Conclusion. PD‐1/PD‐L1 inhibitor chemotherapy combined with Lung Cancer Fang No. 1 has a good and safe effect on SCLC patients. It has a good curative effect in improving the clinical symptoms of patients. It can stabilize the tumor, inhibit the development of lung cancer, improve the body's cellular immune function, adjust the level and expression of tumor markers, improve the body's material metabolism, and restore the balance of yin and yang in the body.},

abstract = {Background: The present study aims to investigate the prognostic role of systematic inflammatory and nutritional indexes in extensive‐stage small‐cell lung cancer (ES‐SCLC) treated with first‐line chemotherapy and atezolizumab. Materials and methods: Prospective cohort population involving 53 patients were identified from NCT03041311 trial. The following peripheral blood‐derived inflammatory and nutritional indexes, including neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet lymphocyte ratio (PLR), lymphocyte–monocyte ratio (LMR), systemic immune‐inflammation index (SII), systemic inflammation response index (SIRI), prognostic nutrition index (PNI), advanced lung cancer inflammation index (ALI), and lung immune prognostic index (LIPI) were evaluated. Results: The optimal cut‐off values of the ALI, LMR, NLR, PLR, PNI, SII and SIRI were 323.23, 2.73, 2.57, 119.23, 48, 533.28 and 2.32, respectively. With a median follow‐up of 17.1 months, the 1‐year OS and PFS were 56% and 8%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that PLR was the only independent prognostic factors for OS among ES‐SCLC patients treated with chemotherapy and atezolizumab (HR 4.63, 95%CI: 1.00–21.46, p = 0.05). K‐M analysis showed that the OS and PFS for patients with high PLR (> 119.23) were significantly poorer than these with low PLR (≤ 119.23) (p = 0.0004 for OS and p = 0.014 for PFS). In external validation set, prognosis of patients with high PLR was also significantly poorer than these with low PLR in terms of OS (p = 0.038) and PFS (p = 0.028). Conclusion: Pre‐treatment PLR could serve as a valuable independent prognostic factor for ES‐SCLC who receive chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors. Further, prospective studies are still needed to confirm our findings.},

abstract = {Background: First‐line durvalumab plus etoposide with either cisplatin or carboplatin (platinum–etoposide) showed a significant improvement in overall survival versus platinum–etoposide alone in patients with extensive‐stage small‐cell lung cancer (ES‐SCLC) in the CASPIAN study. Here we report updated results, including the primary analysis for overall survival with durvalumab plus tremelimumab plus platinum–etoposide versus platinum–etoposide alone. Methods: CASPIAN is an ongoing, open‐label, sponsor‐blind, randomised, controlled phase 3 trial at 209 cancer treatment centres in 23 countries worldwide. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older (20 years in Japan) and had treatment‐naive, histologically or cytologically documented ES‐SCLC, with a WHO performance status of 0 or 1. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) in blocks of six, stratified by planned platinum, using an interactive voice‐response or web‐response system to receive intravenous durvalumab plus tremelimumab plus platinum–etoposide, durvalumab plus platinum–etoposide, or platinum–etoposide alone. In all groups, patients received etoposide 80–100 mg/m2 on days 1–3 of each cycle with investigator's choice of either carboplatin area under the curve 5–6 mg/mL/min or cisplatin 75–80 mg/m2 on day 1 of each cycle. Patients in the platinum–etoposide group received up to six cycles of platinum–etoposide every 3 weeks and optional prophylactic cranial irradiation (investigator's discretion). Patients in the immunotherapy groups received four cycles of platinum–etoposide plus durvalumab 1500 mg with or without tremelimumab 75 mg every 3 weeks followed by maintenance durvalumab 1500 mg every 4 weeks. The two primary endpoints were overall survival for durvalumab plus platinum–etoposide versus platinum–etoposide and for durvalumab plus tremelimumab plus platinum–etoposide versus platinum–etoposide in the intention‐to‐treat population. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03043872. Findings: Between March 27, 2017, and May 29, 2018, 972 patients were screened and 805 were randomly assigned (268 to durvalumab plus tremelimumab plus platinum–etoposide, 268 to durvalumab plus platinum–etoposide, and 269 to platinum–etoposide). As of Jan 27, 2020, the median follow‐up was 25·1 months (IQR 22·3–27·9). Durvalumab plus tremelimumab plus platinum–etoposide was not associated with a significant improvement in overall survival versus platinum–etoposide (hazard ratio [HR] 0·82 [95% CI 0·68–1·00]; p=0·045); median overall survival was 10·4 months (95% CI 9·6–12·0) versus 10·5 months (9·3–11·2). Durvalumab plus platinum–etoposide showed sustained improvement in overall survival versus platinum–etoposide (HR 0·75 [95% CI 0·62–0·91]; nominal p=0·0032); median overall survival was 12·9 months (95% CI 11·3–14·7) versus 10·5 months (9·3–11·2). The most common any‐cause grade 3 or worse adverse events were neutropenia (85 [32%] of 266 patients in the durvalumab plus tremelimumab plus platinum–etoposide group, 64 [24%] of 265 patients in the durvalumab plus platinum–etoposide group, and 88 [33%] of 266 patients in the platinum–etoposide group) and anaemia (34 [13%], 24 [9%], and 48 [18%]). Any‐cause serious adverse events were reported in 121 (45%) patients in the durvalumab plus tremelimumab plus platinum–etoposide group, 85 (32%) in the durvalumab plus platinum–etoposide group, and 97 (36%) in the platinum–etoposide group. Treatment‐related deaths occurred in 12 (5%) patients in the durvalumab plus tremelimumab plus platinum–etoposide group (death, febrile neutropenia, and pulmonary embolism [n=2 each]; enterocolitis, general physical health deterioration and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, pneumonia, pneumonitis and hepatitis, respiratory failure, and sudden death [n=1 each]), six (2%) patients in the durvalumab plus platinum–etoposide group (cardiac arrest, dehydration, hepatotoxicity, interstitial lung disease, pancytopenia, and sepsis [n=1 each]), and two (1%) in the platinum–etoposide group (pancytopenia and thrombocytopenia [n=1 each]). Interpretation: First‐line durvalumab plus platinum–etoposide showed sustained overall survival improvement versus platinum–etoposide but the addition of tremelimumab to durvalumab plus platinum–etoposide did not significantly improve outcomes versus platinum–etoposide. These results support the use of durvalumab plus platinum–etoposide as a new standard of care for the first‐line treatment of ES‐SCLC. Funding: AstraZeneca.},

Combining the recent findings, the TREASURE trial aims at further enhancing response to upfront chemo‐immunotherapy by the addition of thoracic radiotherapy (TRT). Methods/design: The TREASURE trial is a randomized, multicenter, phase II clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT04462276). One hundred four patients suffering from extensive disease (ED) SCLC, with any response to the standard of care induction chemo‐immunotherapy will be randomized to receive atezolizumab maintenance therapy with or without TRT. The primary endpoint of this study is overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints include further measures of efficacy, safety, and the collection of biomarker samples. A safety interim analysis will take place after n = 23 patients receiving TRT have been observed for three months after the end of TRT. Discussion: This trial will investigate whether treatment efficacy can be improved by adding TRT to atezolizumab maintenance therapy in ED SCLC patients with any response after chemo‐immunotherapy. Safety and feasibility of such a regimen will be evaluated, and biomaterials for a translational research project will be collected. Together, the results of this trial will deepen our comprehension of how checkpoint inhibition and radiotherapy interact and contribute to the evolving landscape of SCLC therapy.

abstract = {Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) is a rare tumor, accounting nowadays for 10‐15% of all new lung cancer diagnosis. Approximately one third of patients present with limited disease (LD‐SCLC) confined to the chest with a median survival from 18 to 24 months and a 5‐year survival rate between 20% and 25%. A platinum‐based chemotherapy combined with etoposide and a concurrent thoracic radiotherapy represents the standard of care for LD‐SCLC treatment with a median PFS of 12 months. However, sequential radiotherapy may be preferable for patients with poor performance status or having comorbidity predisposing to a worst tolerability. Clinical evidence supports the immunogenicity of SCLC and the involvement of immune activity in SCLC development and prognosis. Several immune checkpoint inhibitors got the approbation in first and further lines for the advanced SCLC in the last decade. The most important results have been achieved in the first‐line setting for patients receiving a combination of platinum ‐ etoposide chemotherapy and an anti‐PD1/PDL‐1 inhibitor compared to chemotherapy alone. However, despite these were the first positive results after a while in this setting, the modest absolute benefit showed (3 months) have to be taking into account. The possibility to enhance the immunotherapy efficacy in SCLC field with the radiotherapy administered as part of the standard treatment for a LD‐SCLC seems to be a great opportunity. In the PACIFIC trial, the sequential administration of durvalumab in patients with locally advanced, unresectable, stage III Non‐Small‐Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) whose disease had not progressed following platinum‐based concurrent thoracic CRT showed a dramatic overall survival improvement compared to placebo, with manageable toxicities. The ADRIATIC phase III trial, is currently recruiting LD‐SCLC patients not progressing after the concomitant CRT (NCT03703297). Patients are randomized to receive durvalumab, durvalumab plus tremelimumab or placebo as maintenance treatment. In this trial, only ECOG PS 0‐1 patients able to receive a concomitant CRT are eligible. However, in our clinical practice, LD‐SCLC patients may not respect these criteria due to the aggressiveness of cancer and comorbidities. Thus, DURVALUNG study aims to evaluate the efficacy of durvalumab maintenance treatment in frail LD‐SCLC patients who have not progressed following platinum‐based concomitant or sequential CRT.},

abstract = {The brain is a common metastatic site of small cell lung cancer (SCLC), but systematic treatment options are limited by the blood‐brain barrier. Currently, the optimal treatment regimen remains controversial, especially for patients already treated by brain radiotherapy. Anlotinib is a novel oral multitarget tyrosine kinase inhibitor which has shown significant improvement in progression‐free survival and overall survival in third‐line or beyond therapy of advanced SCLC in a randomized, double‐blind phase II study (ALTER1202 trial) based on a Chinese population sample. Emerging data has also suggested that immunotherapy, such as the programmed death ligand 1 (PD‐L1) inhibitor, has a relatively high response rate in brain metastatic SCLC, although there is a lack of large sample‐size studies. Integrating anlotinib and immunotherapy for recurrent or relapsing brain metastases (BMs) of SCLC has not been previously reported, but it is possible that these two treatments may have synergistic effects and provide even better outcomes. Here, we present a case of stage III SCLC who developed lung and BMs after concurrent chemoradiotherapy (cCRT) and achieved radiographic locally complete regression following whole brain irradiation (WBI) with a simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) technique. Durvalumab was delivered as maintenance therapy. Asymptomatic multifocal recurrence of BMs occurred after the administration of the second dose of durvalumab. After administration of combined durvalumab and anlotinib, the BMs achieved near‐complete regression and no severe toxicity was reported. This suggests a potential synergistic effect of combined durvalumab and anlotinib in previously treated BMs in a patient with SCLC and may provide a direction for future clinical decisions.},

abstract = {Background: Relapsed and refractory small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for about 15% of all lung cancers. The prognosis of patients is poor. The 5‐year survival rate is almost 0. The average survival time of patients who refuse to receive treatment is only 2‐4 months. For patients with extensive‐stage SCLC, the current first‐line treatment regimens are mainly platinum‐containing double‐drug chemotherapy. Poside combined with cisplatin/carboplatin and irinotecan combined with cisplatin/carboplatin are commonly used clinical regimens for the treatment of patients with extensive‐stage SCLC. Although SCLC is very sensitive to radiotherapy and chemotherapy, most patients will develop recurrence and metastasis after initial treatment. Therefore, it is necessary to study clinically effective therapeutic drugs for relapsed and refractory SCLC. Objective: To investigate the relationship between programmed death receptor‐1 (programmed death receptor‐1 (PD‐1)) and programmed death receptor‐ligand 1 (programmed death‐ligand 1 (PD‐L1)) inhibitors and Lung Cancer No. 1 efficacy and safety of Lung Cancer Fang No. 1 in the treatment of relapsed and refractory SCLC. Methods: 80 patients with refractory SCLC were selected and randomly divided into control group and treatment group with 40 cases in each group. Among them, the control group received PD‐1/PD‐L1 inhibitor chemotherapy, and the treatment group received PD‐1/PD‐L1 inhibitor chemotherapy combined with Lung Cancer Fang No. 1 treatment. The differences in immune and tumor marker levels, clinical efficacy, and prognostic complications between the two groups before and after treatment were observed and compared. Results: Before treatment, there was no significant difference in clinical improvement between the two groups. After treatment, the clinical symptom scores and body weight changes in the treatment group were significantly improved. The clinical symptom scores in the treatment group were lower than those in the control group, but the body weight changes were higher than those in the control group. The difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). Before treatment, there was no significant difference in the levels of tumor markers between the two groups. After treatment, the levels of CYFRA21‐1, CA125, and VGEF in the treatment group were significantly lower than those in the control group, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the immune level between the two groups before treatment (P > 0.05), while the differences in CD4+, CD3+, and CD4+/CD8+ after treatment were significant, and the treatment group was higher than the control group, with statistical significance (P < 0.05). After treatment, the clinical efficacy of the two groups was significantly improved. The DCR90.00% of the treatment group was significantly higher than that of the control group, 67.50%, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). The analysis of complications after treatment showed that fatigue, anorexia, hypertension, hand‐foot syndrome, diarrhea, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and urinary protein in the treatment group were significantly lower than those in the control group, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). Conclusion: PD‐1/PD‐L1 inhibitor chemotherapy combined with Lung Cancer Fang No. 1 has a good and safe effect on SCLC patients. It has a good curative effect in improving the clinical symptoms of patients. It can stabilize the tumor, inhibit the development of lung cancer, improve the body's cellular immune function, adjust the level and expression of tumor markers, improve the body's material metabolism, and restore the balance of yin and yang in the body.},

abstract = {INTRUDUCTION: Radiation and immunotherapy have separately been shown to confer survival advantages to patients with extensive‐stage small cell lung cancer (ESCLC), but failure rates remain high and combination therapy has been understudied. In this single‐arm phase I trial (NCT02402920), we assessed the safety of combining pembrolizumab with thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) after induction chemotherapy for SCLC. METHODS: Patients with ESCLC who had completed chemotherapy received TRT with pembrolizumab. The maximum tolerated dose of pembrolizumab was assessed by 3+3 dose‐escalation; doses began at 100 mg and increased in 50 mg increments to 200 mg. Pembrolizumab was given every 3 weeks for up to 16 cycles; TRT was prescribed as 45 Gy in 15 daily fractions. Toxicity was evaluated with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0. The primary endpoint was safety of the combined therapy based on the incidence of dose‐limiting toxicity in the 35 days following initiation of treatment. RESULTS: Thirty‐eight patients with ESCLC (median age 65 years, range: 37‐79 years) were enrolled from September 2015 through September 2017; 33 received per‐protocol treatment, and all tolerated pembrolizumab at 100 to 200 mg with no dose‐limiting toxicity in the 35‐day window. There were no grade 4‐5 toxicities; 2 (6%) patients experienced grade 3 events (n = 1 rash, n = 1 asthenia/paresthesia/autoimmune disorder) that were unlikely/doubtfully related to protocol therapy. The median follow‐up time was 7.3 months (range: 1‐13 months); median progression‐free and overall survival times were 6.1 months (95% confidence interval: 4.1‐8.1) and 8.4 months (95% confidence interval: 6.7‐10.1). CONCLUSIONS: Concurrent pembrolizumab‐TRT was tolerated well with few high‐grade adverse events in the short‐term; progression‐free and overall survival rates are difficult to interpret due to heterogeneity in eligibility criteria (e.g., enrolling progressors on induction chemotherapy). Although randomized studies have shown benefits to TRT alone and immunotherapy alone, the safety of the combined regimen supports further investigation as a foundational approach for future prospective studies.},

abstract = {Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for 15%‐20% of all lung cancers, and the overwhelming majority (>95%) are associated with tobacco exposure. The incidence of all types of lung cancer, including SCLC, has been declining in the United States with the onset of tobacco smoking cessation programs, although this trend took nearly 20 years to become evident among men. Overall survival (OS) rates for patients with lung cancer have also increased by about 5% since the advent of low‐dose spiral computed tomography (CT) scanning to detect early lung cancer. The prognosis for patients with SCLC continues to be poor but has improved with the advent of smoking cessation campaigns, more effective chemotherapy agents and radiation planning and delivery techniques, and the use of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) for those who experience a complete response to therapy. Consolidation with chest radiotherapy has improved OS among patients with extensive‐stage SCLC who achieved a complete response to chemotherapy. SCLC often presents as bulky symptomatic masses, and mediastinal involvement is common with or without pleural effusion and extrathoracic disease. Extrathoracic spread (i.e., extensive‐stage disease) is also quite common, being present in 80%‐85% of cases at diagnosis. Brain metastases are present in approximately 20% of patients at diagnosis; roughly half of these metastases are symptomatic and the other half are detected by imaging. Predictors of poor prognosis include poor performance status, older age, and being male. The pathologic subtypes of the disease (small cell carcinoma and combined small cell carcinoma) all carry a similarly poor prognosis. Current guidelines of the U.S. National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommend the use of positron emission tomography (PET), CT scanning, or fused PET/CT scanning of the chest, liver, adrenals, bone, and other areas of concern in the diagnosis and staging of SCLC (NCCN guideline‐SCLC 2017). Thoracic radiotherapy has also become important for improving OS among patients with SCLC who achieved a complete response to chemotherapy. In one prospectively randomized study of 498 patients with extensive‐stage SCLC (WHO performance status score 0‐2) who achieved complete response to chemotherapy, patients who received consolidation thoracic radiotherapy (30 Gy in 10 fractions) had significantly better 2‐year OS rates than did those who did not receive thoracic radiotherapy (13% vs. 3%, P=0.004). Thoracic radiotherapy further improved thoracic‐only failure rates (19.8% vs. 46% without, P=0.001) (Slotman B et al, Lancet Oncol 2015;385:36‐ 42). However, many patients with extensive‐stage SCLC do not respond to the standard etoposide/cisplatin chemotherapy (Fig 1). Those patients may need to receive molecular‐targeted therapies or immunotherapy with the consolidating thoracic radiotherapy. Several histologic and immunohistochemical markers have been evaluated for diagnosing or monitoring treatment response in SCLC, including transcription thyroid factor‐1 (positive in >85% of SCLC cases); cytokeratin 7; deletions in chromosome 3; Leu‐7; chromogranin A; synaptophysin; myc amplification; and p53 mutations (present in ∼75% of cases). Deletions in tumor‐suppressor genes are also relatively common and include fragile histidine triad (FHIT) (80%); RAS effector homologue (RASSF1) (>90%); TP53 (>75%); retinoblastoma‐ 1 (RB1) (>90%); and retinoic acid receptor‐beta (72%). However, to date no biomarkers have been validated for use in diagnosing SCLC. Moreover, mutations that are often present in non‐small cell lung cancer (such as epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR] mutations and anaplastic lymphoma kinase [ALK]) are rare in SCLC. Several clinicopathologic features have been linked with worse prognosis, including poor performance status, significant weight loss, high lactate dehydrogenase levels, large numbers of metastatic sites, and the presence of paraneoplastic syndromes. Because SCLC has the among the highest rates of somatic driver mutations, and because more than 95% of patients with SCLC are former or current smokers, immunotherapy seems a reasonable approach, as high mutation burdens correlate with good response to chemoradiotherapy and sensitivity to immunomodulators (Peifer M et al., Nat Genet 2012;44(10):1104‐10). At MD Anderson Cancer Center, an ongoing phase I/II study of patients with extensive‐stage SCLC has been proposed to the NRG as a prospective randomized study (PI J Welsh) (Fig 2). Use of thoracic radiotherapy to consolidate a site at which SCLC is quite likely to recur is reasonable, given that recurrence considerably reduces quality of their life as well as OS. In summary, in most cases SCLC presents as extensive‐stage disease, for which outcomes are very poor. Consolidation with thoracic radiotherapy for patients who achieve a complete response to chemotherapy can improve 2‐year OS rates. However, less toxic and more effective systemic treatment is also required to derive the greatest benefit from consolidation thoracic radiotherapy.},

abstract = {Immunotherapy of Small Cell Lung Cancer Nevin Murray MD, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, Canada The general principles of cytotoxic chemotherapy for advanced SCLC and NSCLC have many similarities and have advanced minimally over the past two decades.1 The success of cancer genomics research in changing the care of patients with NSCLC with a driver mutation suitable for targeted treatment has been a powerful incentive to discover such molecular targets in SCLC. Although comparative genomic profiling shows some similarities between SCLC and NSCLC, for SCLC, the abnormalities identified to date are mainly tumor suppressor genes.2 These loss‐of‐function alterations do not provide the clear opportunity for rapid clinical translation offered by an activating mutation in a known receptor tyrosine kinase. A considerable number of targeted agents have already been tried in SCLC clinical trials without notable success.3 In contrast, there is a growing body of evidence for immunotherapy as a promising new treatment for both SCLC and NSCLC. Immunotherapy investigated for SCLC includes interferon, vaccines, antibody‐drug conjugates and immune checkpoint inhibitors. Interferon and vaccines have been studied in phase II and III trials without sufficient activity to change practice. Although preliminary, the data emerging from trials of antibody‐drug conjugates and immune checkpoint inhibitors has generated more excitement and are the focus for this abstract. Antibody‐drug conjugates: The components of an antibody‐drug conjugate include an antibody directed at a defined antigen on cancer cells, a linker, and a cytotoxic agent. This package represents an effective mechanism of targeted drug delivery potentially resulting in decreased toxicity and an improved therapeutic index. Rovalpituzumab teserine targets the Notch pathway with a monoclonal antibody portion directed against the cell surface available Notch ligand delta‐like protein 3 (DLL3), which is over‐expressed in SCLC tumor‐initiating cells but not in normal tissue. Rudin et al.4 have reported a phase I study including 74 patients with previously treated SCLC. The confirmed response rate in 56 evaluable patients was 16%, but in 26 that showed high DLL3 expression, the response rate was 31%. Response rate was 13% in second‐line and 25% in the third‐line setting with some durable responses observed. A phase II trial for third‐line treatment of patients with DLL3 expressing tumors has begun and if positive will be the first approved agent in this setting. Sacituzumab govitecan is another antibody‐drug conjugate of a topoisomerase I inhibitor linked to an antibody to the Trop‐2 epithelial antigen.5 In a phase I/II clinical trial enrolling 33 evaluable SCLC patients with a median of 2.5 previous chemotherapies, the response rate was 24% and the median overall survival was 8.1 months. Dose limiting neutropenia was 34% and grade 3+ diarrhea was seen in 9%. Immune checkpoint inhibitors: Since immune checkpoint blockade is more active in hyper‐mutated tumors, SCLC should be a good candidate disease for this treatment because of a strong association with tobacco carcinogenesis and a high frequency of somatic mutations. 2 The most advanced trial evidence is available for a cytotoxic T‐cell antibody (CTLA4) and data for two programmed death (PD‐1) immune checkpoint inhibitors is emerging. After a randomized phase II trial of ipilimumab and phased chemotherapy showed a modest improvement in progression‐free survival as first‐line treatment of advanced SCLC,6 a large phase III placebo controlled trial was performed in which 1,132 previously untreated patients were randomly assigned to receive either etoposide and platinum for four cycles alone or together with the CTLA‐4 antibody ipilimumab.7 The trial was negative with similar response rates and no difference in the primary end point of overall survival (hazard ratio 0.94; 95% CI 0.81‐1.09). Immune checkpoint blockade with PD‐1 or dual CTLA‐4 and PD‐1 inhibition may be a more effective strategy. In a large phase I/II trial including 180 previously treated SCLC patients, Antonia et al.8 reported a response rate of 13% (7/80) with nivolumab 3 mg/kg and 31% (14/45) in a cohort of nivolumab 1 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 3 mg/kg. The activity of nivolumab alone or combined with ipilimumab was seen regardless of PD‐L1 expression and not related to platinum sensitivity or line of therapy. The responses were durable with one‐year overall survival of 27% for nivolumab alone and 48% for the combination arm. These results have led to two phase III studies among patients with SCLC evaluating nivolumab, nivolumab/ ipilimumab versus placebo in the maintenance setting after first‐line therapy and nivolumab versus placebo in the second‐line setting. As part of a phase IB multi‐cohort study (KEYNOTE‐028), pembrolizumab was evaluated among patients with relapsed SCLC with PD‐L1 positive tumors.9 Of the 135 SCLC patients screened, 37 (27%) had PD‐L1 positive tumors. The response rate was 29% in 24 evaluable patients. The median duration of response was 29 weeks and durable responses were observed. There is an ongoing phase II study of this agent as maintenance therapy after the completion of standard first‐line therapy in extensive stage disease. A phase I trial is evaluating pembrolizumab with conconcurrent chemoradiation. Adverse events associated with checkpoint inhibitors is greater with CTLA‐4 combined with the PD‐1 antibody combination but were generally manageable. The proportion discontinuing therapy for toxicity was usually less than 10%. The literature contains anecdotes of autoimmune syndromes such as limbic encephalitis.8 Immune para‐neoplastic syndromes are expected in a small proportion of patients with SCLC and an increase in their occurrence with immunotherapy requires close monitoring. However, this concern is currently insufficient to impede further trials with these promising agents. Conclusion: Over the past 20 years, almost all phase III trials of systemic therapy for SCLC have failed to improve outcome and advances have been restricted to improved application of radiotherapy. Like squamous carcinomas, the SCLC molecular battlefield is complex and bleak with little opportunity of even temporary respite by identification of mutually exclusive oncogenic drivers that can be treated for patient benefit. Ironically, this hyper‐mutated genome and greater neo‐antigen expression may enhance the probability of success with immunotherapy. One senses that the likelihood is high for approval of antibody‐drug conjugates and immune checkpoint inhibitors for SCLC after the current roster of clinical trials are reported.},

abstract = {Platinum‐based neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) is the standard of care for patients with locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Gemcitabine plus cisplatin(GP) has been demonstrated an effective chemotherapy regimen for NPC patients in previous studies. Three cycles of GP neoadjuvant chemotherapy resulted in 10% of complete response rate, and GP neoadjuvant chemotherapy added to chemoradiotherapy significantly improved recurrence‐free survival (85.3% vs 76.5%) and overall survival (94.6% vs 90.3%) among locoregionally advanced NPC patients , as compared with concurrent chemoradiotherapy alone. Therefore, GP has been established as the highest level of evidence‐based neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen in the 2020 National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines. Recently, immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti‐programmed cell death‐1 (PD‐1) monoclonal antibody has shown promising efficacy in NPC patients. Clinical trials have shown objective response rates of 20.5%‐34% in patients with recurrent or metastatic NPC patients receiving anti PD‐1 monoclonal antibody immunotherapy including pembrolizumab, nivolumab, camrelizumab, and toripalimab. GP chemotherapy combined with anti PD‐1 antibody were hence considered in treating locoregionally advanced NPC. Concurrent radiotherapy might cause T‐cell dysfunction, and larger‐volume elective nodal irradiation might hinder immunotherapy effects by directly depleting memory T cells. No survival benefit was observed when PD‐1 blockade was added concurrently to the CCRT phase for treating head and neck cancers. On the contrary, several studies have demonstrated that administration of immunotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting modified the primary tumor into an antigen source for T‐cell expansion and priming, thereby resulting in stronger effects than those of adjuvant therapy. Currently there were 3 trials exploring the addition of immunotherapy to chemoradiotherapy, the preliminary results of which were recently published. These trials had different trial designs, with two trials utilized anti PD‐1 inhibitors in all treatment phases including neoadjuvant, concurrent and adjuvant phases, The third trial, which was conducted by our team, gave anti PD‐1 inhibitor only in the neoadjuvant phase, and promising efficacy was observed in our study. Adebrelimab is a recombinant humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody with specificity for PD‐L1. In a phase III clinical trial of extensive stage small‐cell lung cancer, the addition of adebrelimab significantly improved the median overall survival compared with the control group (15.3 vs. 12.8，HR 0.72, P=0.0017). So we hypothesize that GP neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with adebrelimab could further improve the survival of patients with high‐risk locoregionally advanced NPC (diagnosed with T4 or N2‐3 disease). Therefore, we designed this phase II multi‐center randomized controlled trial to evaluate whether GP neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with adebrelimab plus cisplatin‐based CCRT improve the complete response rate of high‐risk locoregionally advanced NPC patients compared with GP neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus CCRT.},

abstract = {Pembrolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against PD‐1 capable of enhancing antitumor immune activity. The KEYNOTE‐001 study showed that pembrolizumab has activity in advanced non‐small‐cell lung cancer patients and identified programmed death ligand 1 (PD‐L1) as a companion test to select patients most likely to benefit from pembrolizumab. Five randomized clinical trials showed the efficacy of pembrolizumab in non‐small‐cell lung cancer: in second‐line setting PD‐L1 ≥1% (KEYNOTE‐010), in first‐line setting PD‐L1 ≥50% (KEYNOTE‐024 and KEYNOTE‐042) and in first‐line setting in combination with platinum doublets, any expression of PD‐L1 (KEYNOTE‐189 and KEYNOTE‐407). Future challenges are the identification of the role of pembrolizumab in adjuvant, neoadjuvant, locally advanced disease or oncogene‐addicted patients, in combination with radiotherapy or other biological agents.},

abstract = {Purpose/Objective(s): Radiotherapy (RT) with concurrent chemotherapy is a standard treatment for Stage III NSCLC. However, radiation pneumonitis incidence increases rapidly with volume of lung irradiated, and esophagitis increases with dose to the esophagus. Both conditions can have adverse impacts on patients’ quality of life. Daily online adaptive RT (ART) may allow for reduced normal tissue doses due to smaller margins around the target, as well as target size reduction with tumor response. This prospective, randomized controlled trial tests the hypothesis that the proportion of study participants who experience score ≥3 PRO‐CTCAE cough, dyspnea, or dysphagia will be at least 20% lower with daily ART than with non‐adapted RT. Materials/Methods: Enrollment goals are 244 subjects at up to 10 cancer centers worldwide. Eligibility criteria include stage IIIA‐IIIC (AJCC v8) NSCLC; baseline grade 0‐2 dyspnea, cough, and dysphagia; and no contralateral hilar or supraclavicular/cervical lymph node involvement. Subjects will be randomized (1:1) to CBCT‐based daily ART or non‐adapted RT using IMRT or VMAT delivering 60‐66 Gy in 30‐33 fractions with concurrent platinum doublet chemotherapy. Adjuvant immunotherapy with durvalumab is permitted. Follow‐up for study participants will be for 1‐year post‐completion of chemoRT. Study endpoints include: frequency of PRO‐CTCAE score ≥3 cough, dyspnea, or dysphagia from randomization to 30 days post‐chemoRT; patient‐reported quality of life (FACT‐L and EQ‐5D‐5L questionnaires); percentage of lung receiving ≥20 Gy; mean doses to lung, heart, and esophagus; primary tumor response on CT or PET‐CT (RECIST v1.1); local disease progression; and incidence of grade ≥2 pneumonitis within 1 year. Stratification factors are the treating institution and the presence of contralateral mediastinal lymph node metastases (associated with increased volume of irradiated lung). Interim analyses for futility and superiority will be performed when the primary endpoint data have been collected for 50% of evaluable participants. Results: This study opened to enrollment on 20 October 2022 and is expected to be completed in approximately 3 years. Conclusion: This prospective, randomized clinical trial rigorously evaluates the impacts of daily online ART on radiation pneumonitis, esophagitis, and quality of life in patients with advanced NSCLC. It will collect standard tumor response and disease progression metrics to assure that reduced margins do not have an adverse impact on outcomes. Online ART is emerging as an innovative approach enabling increased sparing of normal tissues. The results of this clinical study will support evidence‐based clinical decisions around ART technologies.},

We conducted a Phase I clinical trial to evaluate the toxicity and humoral immune response elicited by 1E10 vaccine in patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Eligible patients were those who after received chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy had partial or complete response to treatment. Patients received four biweekly injections with 2 mg of aluminum hydroxide‐precipitated 1E10 MAb, then other six doses at 28‐day intervals, and later the patients who maintained a good performance status were reimmunized. Six patients with limited‐stage disease and three with extensive‐stage disease were enrolled in the study. Most of the patients who received at least four doses of 1E10 vaccine developed strong specific antibody responses against 1E10 MAb and NeuGc‐GM3 ganglioside. Antibodies able to react with lung carcinoma tissue sections were detected in sera from vaccinated patients. A prolonged survival was observed in several patients treated with the anti‐idiotype vaccine. No evidence of serious adverse effects was found.},

abstract = {Introduction Digital patient monitoring (DPM) tools can enable more effective clinical care and improved patient outcomes in cancer. However, their broad adoption requires ease of use and demonstration of real‐world clinical utility/impact. ORIGAMA (MO42720) is an interventional, open‐label, multicountry platform study investigating the clinical utility of DPM tools and specific treatments. ORIGAMA will begin with two cohorts that aim to assess the impact of the atezolizumab‐specific Roche DPM Module (hosted on the Kaiku Health DPM platform (Helsinki, Finland)) on health outcomes and healthcare resource usage, and its feasibility to support at‐home treatment administration, in participants receiving systemic anticancer treatment. Other digital health solutions may be added to future cohorts. Methods and analysis In Cohort A, participants with metastatic non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), extensive‐stage SCLC or Child Pugh A unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma will be randomised to a locally approved anticancer regimen containing intravenous atezolizumab (TECENTRIQ, F. Hoffmann‐La Roche Ltd/Genentech) and local standard‐of‐care support, with/without the Roche DPM Module. Cohort B will assess the feasibility of the Roche DPM Module in supporting administration of three cycles of subcutaneous atezolizumab (1875 mg; Day 1 of each 21‐day cycle) in the hospital, followed by 13 cycles at home by a healthcare professional (ie, flexible care), in participants with programmed cell‐death ligand 1‐positive, early‐stage NSCLC. The primary endpoints are the mean difference in change of the participant‐reported Total Symptom Interference Score at Week 12 from baseline (Cohort A) and flexible care adoption rate at Cycle 6 (Cohort B). Ethics and dissemination This study will be conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki, and/or the applicable laws and regulations of the country in which the research is conducted, whichever affords the greater protection to the individual. The study received its first Ethics Committee approval in Spain in October 2022. Participants will provide written informed consent in a face‐to‐face setting. The results of this study will be presented at national and/or international congresses and disseminated via publication in peer‐reviewed journals. Trial registration number NCT05694013.},

abstract = {The introduction of immunotherapy has fundamentally transformed the treatment landscape in cancer, providing long‐term survival benefit for patients with advanced disease across multiple tumor types, including non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In the placebo‐controlled phase 3 PACIFIC trial, the PD‐L1 inhibitor durvalumab demonstrated significant improvements in progression‐free survival and overall survival in patients with unresectable, stage III NSCLC who had not progressed after platinum‐based chemoradiotherapy (CRT). These findings have led to the widespread acceptance of the ?PACIFIC regimen? (durvalumab after CRT) as the standard of care in this setting. Moreover, the PACIFIC trial is the first study to demonstrate a proven survival advantage with an immunotherapy in a curative‐intent setting, thereby providing a strong rationale for further investigation of durvalumab in early‐stage cancers. Herein, we describe the extensive clinical development program for durvalumab across multiple tumor types in curative‐intent settings, outlining the scientific rationale(s) for its use and highlighting the innovative research (e.g., personalized cancer monitoring) advanced by these trials.},

abstract = {Introduction: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for 14% of all lung cancers. Despite immunotherapy approved, SCLC is still associated with a poor prognosis and many patients relapse and develop drug resistance. Subsequent therapies are limited and the overall survival for recurrent SCLC is around 26 weeks. Anlotinib is a multi‐target receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor that can significantly inhibit angiogenesis. The ALTER 1202 trial showed anlotinib monotherapy has a longer median PFS compared with placebo (4.1 vs. 0.7 months) in patients (pts) with SCLC who had received ≥ 2 prior lines of chemotherapy. National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) has approved anlotinib in the third‐ or further‐line treatment for SCLC. Niraparib is a highly selective PARP1 and PARP2 inhibitor approved in advanced ovarian cancer. ZL‐2306‐005 trial is a phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of niraparib as first‐line maintenance therapy in Chinese pts with platinum‐responsive extensive stage‐SCLC (ES‐SCLC). Although the study did not reach primary end points, niraparib showed a modest effect in prolonging the PFS of platinum‐responsive pts with ES‐SCLC. Methods: CAN study is a prospective, open‐label, single‐arm phase II trial aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of niraparib in combination with anlotinib in recurrent SCLC pts. Eligible pts with aged 18‐75 years and ECOG performance status 0‐2 must have histologically confirmed recurrent SCLC who had received ≥1 platinumbased chemotherapy. Each patient has evaluable target lesion according to RESCIST v1.1. Prior anti‐PD‐L1 treatment is allowed. Pts will receive niraparib (300 mg or 200 mg QD) and anlotinib (12 mg QD, Day1‐14), 21 days for a cycle. Treatment will continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death, or withdrawal of informed consent. The primary endpoint is ORR; secondary endpoints include PFS, OS, DCR, DOR and safety. Exploratory analyses are planned. The study will enroll up to 62 pts with a Simon's two‐stage design. In the first stage, 19 pts will be enrolled. If there are ≤3 responses in these 19 pts, study will be stopped.

abstract = {Introduction: Treatment options are limited for patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer (ES‐SCLC) after progression on first line chemo‐immunotherapy (CIT). Temozolomide (TEM) is active in ES‐SCLC and has been shown to have an immunomodulatory effect for patients with advanced cancers. Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy combined with TEM has demonstrated promising activity among patients in 2nd and 3rd line after CIT (NCT03728361, reported at this meeting). Two different dosing regimens of TEM monotherapy have been explored in ES‐SCLC but the objective response rate among patients treated after first line CIT remains unknown. Methods: NCT04919382 is a randomized, two‐cohort, multiple‐institution, open‐label phase 2 trial of atezolizumab combined with TEM for patients with ES‐SCLC. Patients who experienced disease progression after treatment with first‐line CIT are eligible. Study treatment consists of atezolizumab 1680 mg IV and two dosing regimens of TEM based on prior phase 2 trials: TEM 150 mg/m2 for days 1‐5 (cohort 1) and TEM 75 mg/m2 days 1‐21 (cohort 2) out of 28 day cycles. Patients (N=28 in each cohort) will be randomized to each TEM dosing cohort and stratified by presence of brain metastases and platinum sensitive/resistant disease. The primary endpoint is disease response rate by RECIST v1.1. Progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) will be assessed using the method of Kaplan‐Meier, and adverse events will be graded using CTCAE v5. Exploratory analyses include an evaluation of changes in myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and other immune subsets in peripheral blood induced by the different dosing of TEM, and differences in pre‐treatment gut microbiomes between responders and non‐responders. A response rate of 15% or less is the null hypothesis and an overall response rate of 35% or more would be considered promising. Based on these assumptions, this phase 2 design will require 28 evaluable patients in each cohort using a one‐stage design with 80% power and one‐sided significance level of 0.05. Conclusion: This randomized phase 2 trial will study the efficacy of atezolizumab and two different dosing regimens of temozolomide in patients with refractory/recurrent ES‐SCLC as second line therapy including in patients with brain metastases. NCT04919382 is currently enrolling at Ohio State University and will soon be opening at additional sites in the Big 10 Cancer Research Consortium. [Formula presented]},

abstract = {Background: cCRT is the standard of care in LS‐SCLC, but LS‐SCLC still represents a significant unmet medical need with a median survival of 25 to 30 mo. Addition of the anti‐PD‐L1 antibody adebrelimab to carboplatin and etoposide has demonstrated survival benefits in extensive‐stage SCLC in the phase 3 CAPSTONE‐1 trial. This ongoing, 2‐stage, phase 3 study aims to evaluate cCRT with adebrelimab in LS‐SCLC. Methods: In the safety run‐in stage, patients with pathologically confirmed, unresectable LS‐SCLC were enrolled. Treatment consisted of four 3‐week cycles of adebrelimab (20 mg/kg, iv, d1, Q3W) plus carboplatin (AUC 5, iv, d1, Q3W) and etoposide (100 mg/m2, iv, d1, 2, 3, Q3W), with thoracic radiotherapy started on cycle 3 (60 Gy/2 Gy, QD, 6 weeks). Following cCRT, patients received maintenance adebrelimab (20 mg/kg, iv, Q3W) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicities. The primary endpoint was safety. Results: In the safety run‐in stage, 28 patients were enrolled and all received adebrelimab with cCRT. As of Oct. 31, 2023, median follow‐up was 29.4 mo (range 6.5‐33.3). Grade ≥3 TRAEs occurred in 27 (96.4%) patients; all events with an incidence of ≥10% were hematological toxicities. Four (14.3%) patients had treatment‐related pneumonitis and one (3.6%) had treatment‐related immune‐mediated lung disease (all grade 2). TRAEs led to treatment discontinuation in one (3.6%; infusion‐related reactions) patient. There were no deaths due to TRAEs. Confirmed ORR was 92.9% (26/28; 95% CI 76.5‐99.1) and DCR was 100% (28/28; 95% CI 87.7‐100). Among responders, median DoR was 20.1 mo (95% CI 7.7‐not reached [NR]; 11/26 responses ongoing). Median PFS was 17.9 mo (95% CI 8.8‐NR). Median OS was NR and the OS rate at 2 years was 64.3% (95% CI 43.8‐78.9). Conclusions: In the safety run‐in stage, adebrelimab with cCRT showed acceptable tolerability and favorable efficacy outcomes in LS‐SCLC. The randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled stage of the trial is ongoing to further assess the regimen. Clinical trial identification: NCT04691063.

abstract = {Purpose To assess preliminary safety and efficacy results of the anti‐programmed cell death ligand‐1 (anti‐PD‐L1) durvalumab in combination with radiotherapy (RT) in an expansion cohort of patients included in a phase 1/2 trial at our institution. Patients and methods Data from patients who received concurrent palliative RT with durvalumab (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks via intravenous infusion) were analysed in terms of safety (CTCAE v4.0) and efficacy (RECIST v1.1 and tumour growth rate [TGR]). Results Between 02/2014 and 04/2016, 10 patients received palliative local irradiation of 15 isolated lesions. Most patients (90%) had received one or more prior lines of systemic therapy for advanced disease. The median duration of exposure to durvalumab was 5.2 months with a median delivery of 11 cycles (range, 4–38 cycles). RT (conformal 3D RT, 79% and intracranial stereotactic RT, 21%) was delivered at a median biologically‐effective dose of 28 Gy (range, 6–92), in a median number of five fractions (range, 1–10) and over a median duration of 6 d (range, 1–14). Five patients (50%) reported an irradiation‐related adverse event (AE) grade (G) 1 or 2 and one patient had two G2 AEs. The most frequently reported AE (3/6) was G2 mucositis. There was no G3 or more RT‐related AEs. All AEs were transient, lasted less than one week, and were manageable by standard guidelines. There was no unexpected AE. On 10/15 in‐field (IF) evaluable lesions, the objective response (OR) rate was 60% (complete response, 2/10 and partial response, 4/10) and 4/10 stable disease (SD). All evaluated IF lesions had a TGR decrease resulting in a significant decrease in the TGR between the two periods (before versus after RT; p < 0.01). Outfields disease evaluation retrieved 10/14 SD and 4/14 progressive disease (PD). There was no out‐field OR, no abscopal effect and no out‐field difference between the two periods according to TGR (p = 0.09). Conclusion In this small data set of patients, concurrent palliative RT with the anti‐PD‐L1 durvalumab was well tolerated. ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT01693562; EudraCT number: 2012‐002206‐52.},

abstract = {Only a decade ago, lung cancer was largely considered a non‐immunogenic tumor. The focus of most clinical efforts at the time was development of molecularly targeted agents in hopes to personalize the systemic treatment of lung cancer. Although much has been accomplished over the last 15 years, with regulatory approvals of several targeted agents for EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF and NTRK driven tumors, and emerging targeted therapies for other molecularly defined cohorts (e.g. MET, RET, HER2 driven tumors), the majority of patients with lung cancer do not have readily targetable molecular alterations. Arguably, the most impactful advance in the systemic treatment of lung cancer over the last several decades has been the appreciation and utilization of immunotherapy to attack and control typical lung cancer. Indeed, five‐ year survival rates from the first phase I trials of programmed death (PD)‐1 inhibitor trials (BMS‐003 and KEYNOTE‐001) in patients with pre‐treated advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are an unprecedented 16% (n=578, median duration of response 17 ‐ 39 months), with five‐ year survival rate from one trial (KEYNOTE‐001) evaluating chemo naive advanced lung cancer patients of 23% (n=101, median duration of response 17 months) (ref: PMID, ). Based on subsequent randomized clinical trials, PD‐1 axis inhibitor therapy has become standard first line therapy for the majority of patients with advanced NSCLC (those without readily targetable tumor molecular alterations), either alone (pembrolizumab) if tumor PD‐ ligand 1 (L1) expression is high (≥ 50%), or with standard platinum doublet chemotherapy if tumor PD‐L1 expression is low/ negative/ unknown (pembrolizumab regardless of NSCLC histology; atezolizumab for non‐squamous NSCLC) (ref: PMID,, 2986395). PD‐1 axis inhibitor therapy with durvalumab is additionally approved as consolidation therapy for patients with locally advanced NSCLC after receiving definitive concurrent chemoradiation without progression (ref: PMID ). PD‐1 axis inhibitor therapy has also shown activity in advanced small cell lung cancer (SCLC), with regulatory approvals of atezolizumab combined with first line etoposide/ platinum chemotherapy, and nivolumab or pembrolizumab as 3rd line therapy (in practice, nivolumab is often combined with ipilimumab after failure of chemotherapy as endorsed by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network) (ref: PMID, ). Several phase III immunotherapy lung cancer studies are ongoing in the adjuvant and metastatic setting, with additional regulatory approvals anticipated in the coming years. Despite the success with PD‐1 axis inhibitors, and tremendous impact on treatment paradigms for lung cancer, most treated patients do not clearly benefit from therapy, and most of those who do respond will ultimately develop resistance with recurrence/ progression of their cancer. Little is known about mechanisms of resistance, and coordinated translational efforts across cancer centers will be required to understand both acquired and primary resistance (to date, we are only aware of two published reports describing potential mechanisms of acquired resistance to PD‐1 axis inhibitors in lung cancer; one implicating acquired loss of beta‐2 microglobulin with resultant lack of MHC1 expression, the other, loss of tumor specific neoantigens through elimination of tumor subclones or chromosomal loss of truncal alterations) (ref: PMID:, ). Currently, several trials are evaluating novel immunotherapeutic agents, including other immune checkpoint inhibitors, costimulatory agonists, vaccines, oncolytic viruses and cellular therapies. In most of these trials, patients are not selected by unique molecular/ immunologic characteristics of their tumor. Rather, empiric combinations of therapy (often including a PD‐1 axis inhibitor) are generally trialed with tumor biopsies to help understand mechanisms of response and resistance. In clinical practice, a handful of unanswered questions repeatedly surface when treating lung cancer patients with immunotherapy. These include: What is the optimal duration of PD‐1 axis inhibitor therapy? Although there is little data to guide us here, we generally consider treatment holiday after 2 years of therapy without progression. However, PD‐1 axis therapy can be continued indefinitely as was done in most registrational trials. What is the role of immunotherapy in never smokers and those with targetable molecular alterations driving their disease? There remains pessimism about use of immunotherapy in these populations, with the belief that tumors in such patients are less immunogenic (lower mutational burden with less neoantigens). However, there are limited numbers of patients who do respond, and efforts are underway to understand these responses. Novel immunotherapeutic approaches are also being developed. Currently, many thoracic oncologists will reserve PD‐1 axis inhibitor therapy until no other standard targeted therapies (or trials evaluating novel targeted therapy) or chemotherapy remain. When should we concede that a patient’s tumor is primarily resistant to PD‐1 axis inhibitor therapy. i.e., how much time on therapy should be allowed to exclude delayed response or pseudo‐progression. Generally, if a patient’s performance status has not deteriorated at the first tumor assessment on immunotherapy (6‐8 weeks), many thoracic oncologists will continue therapy for another 6 weeks. If assessment at that time shows further progression, therapy is discontinued. Should immunotherapy ever be continued with addition of other systemic therapy on progression of disease? Generally, this is not recommended, unless a patient is having a mixed response or acquired resistance with oligo‐progressive disease. That said, there is some rationale here, as PD‐L1 may be induced in tumors by subsequent therapy. Is there any role for consolidation durvalumab in patients with locally advanced NSCLC after concurrent chemoradiation followed by lung resection? The PACIFIC trial leading to approval of consolidation durvalumab did not include such patients; currently, durvalumab is not indicated after surgery. Should salvage nivolumab combined with ipilimumab be considered in patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer after progression on standard chemotherapy plus/ minus atezolizumab. Although nivolumab plus ipilimumab is not approved for use in the United States as salvage therapy for SCLC, it is occasionally prescribed as endorsed by the NCCN. It is unclear if the combination would have any activity in a patient who failed prior atezolizumab in combination with etoposide/ platinum. Keywords: Immunotherapy},

abstract = {Purpose/Objective(s): Small cell lung cancer accounts for 10‐15% of all lung cancers. Majority of patients present with extensive stage disease (ES‐SCLC). Two‐year survival is poor, with median survival ranging from 7‐10 months. The role of PCI remains controversial in ES‐SCLC given conflicting results from randomized trials. Similarly, routine thoracic radiation (TRT) while had shown significant benefit in improving local control, given high incidence of systemic recurrence has not been adopted widely. It has been our practice to consider PCI and TRT in patients with no evidence of disease progression after initial chemotherapy. Here, we report our single institution retrospective analysis of patients undergoing PCI or intrathoracic radiotherapy after chemotherapy. Materials/Methods: Patients with ES‐SCLC diagnosis who did not have brain metastasis at initial diagnosis and completed initial chemotherapy from 2009–2018 are included with IRB approval. We collected demographic information, sites of metastatic disease, and treatment details. Survival analysis was performed using Kaplan‐Meier estimates with log‐rank testing for comparison. We evaluated use of PCI, TRT, age, race and number of sites of disease for overall survival. Results: From our small cell lung cancer database, 137 patients met the criteria and are included in the analysis. The median age was 65.6 years (43 – 91) with 70% being males and 73% being white race. 56 patients received TRT and 34 patients received PCI. The median TRT dose was 32.5 Gy (20 – 60 Gy). Liver (51%) was most common metastatic site followed by bone, 36%. The median overall survival for all patients was 9 months, with 12‐ and 18‐month survival being 31.6% and 11.8%. The median overall survival with PCI was 13 months compared to 7 months with no PCI (p<0.0001). Similarly, TRT improved median survival to 12 months versus 6 months without (p<0.003). The overall survival of patients receiving both PCI and TRT compared to none was 13 vs 5 months (p = 0.0001). Patients receiving PCI or TRT, younger age ≤ 65 years had improved median OS compared to > 65 years, 14 vs 11 months (p = 0.026). Race, sex and number of metastatic sites were not significant. Conclusion: Our single institutional result suggested benefit of both PCI and TRT in these patient populations who had any response to chemotherapy. Recently, the addition of immune check point inhibitor to platinum‐etoposide in ES‐SCLC have shown improvement in median survival from 10 to 13 months. Future trials are needed to evaluate the role of PCI and TRT in combination with chemo‐immunotherapy.},

abstract = {Background: In China, small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for over 15% of lung cancers. The morbidity of SCLC has been continuously increasing. SCLC is invasive, fast‐growing cancer that distinctly differs from other cancers. Approximately 70% of cases present with metastasis at diagnosis and the median overall survival rate is about 8 to 11 months with a 5‐year survival rate of less than 5%. Although being sensitive to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, SCLC patients are liable to relapse and often present with drug resistance. Here we study the combination of Socazolimab, an anti‐PDL1 antibody, carboplatin and etoposide to treat extensive stage small cell lung cancer. Methods: The study is a randomized, double‐blinded, placebo‐controlled multicenter Phase III clinical trial. Patients who have extensive‐stage SCLC are eligible to the trial. Patients are randomly assigned to the study group (Socazolimab + carboplatin + etoposide) or control group (placebo + carboplatin + etoposide) at 1:1 ratio, with a treatment cycle of every 3 weeks. There are 4 cycles of chemotherapy followed by Socazolimab or placebo alone until termination events occurred or for up to 2 years. The primary endpoint is overall survival (OS). The major secondary endpoint is progression free survival (PFS). Results: There were a total of 498 patients recruited for the study with average age of 61.9 amount which 449 patients were diagnosed with stage IV SCLC. All the analysis was based on intent‐to‐treat (ITT). The median baseline performance status score was 1.0. The median OS of study group and control group are 13.90 months (95% CI: 12.22‐15.34) and 11.58 months (95% CI: 10.64‐12.81) respectively, with a P‐value of 0.0316. The 24 month survival rate of study group and control group are 20.7% (95% CI:14.8‐27.3) and 5.9 %(95% CI: 0.8‐18.9). The median PFS of the two groups are 5.55 months (95% CI:5.06‐5.82) and 4.37 months (95% CI: 4.27‐4.70) with a Pvalue < 0.0001. The treatment related adverse event were similar in both groups. Conclusions: These results show that Socazolimab plus chemotherapy continued to provide clinically meaningful improvements in OS for patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer.},

abstract = {Thirty‐eight patients with small‐cell carcinoma were treated with cyclophosphamide, Adriamycin, and VP16‐213 + or ‐ MER. Response and survival of the six patients who received radiotherapy prior to entering the study were inferior compared with patients who received chemotherapy alone. Of 32 previously untreated patients, 13 had limited and 19 had extensive disease. Ninety‐seven percent of these 32 responded and 63% achieved complete remission (CR). All patients with limited disease had a response and 77% achieved CR. Patients with extensive and limited disease had 91/2 months (range 1‐26 months) and 14 months (range 31/2 ‐42 + months) median survival, respectively. The median survival for all complete responders irrespective of extent of disease was 16 months (range 6 ‐ 42 + months). Three patients with limited disease are disease free more than 34 + months and off all therapy 10 + to 18 + months. Eighteen of 38 patients required antibiotics for fever during neutropenia. Eight patients had MER fevers and nine had serious infections. There were four drug‐related deaths. MER therapy did not influence response rate, drug toxicity, or survival, but did add morbidity. This combination chemotherapy alone is an effective treatment for previously untreated small‐cell lung cancer patients regardless of extent of disease.},

abstract = {Background: Consolidative thoracic radiotherapy (cTRT) has shown a marginal improvement in overall survival (OS) and progression‐free survival (PFS) for extensive‐stage small‐cell cancer (ES‐SCLC). Consequently, ASTRO and NCCN guidelines conditionally recommend the use of cTRT. Despite the recent establishment of anti‐PD‐L1 antibody (aPD‐L1) combined with platinum‐doublet chemotherapy as the standard first‐line treatment for ES‐SCLC, the impact of cTRT in the era of immunotherapy remains uncertain. Methods: The JCOG2002 study, a randomized, multicenter phase 3 trial, initiated in October 2021 to assess the superiority of additional cTRT in terms of OS for ES‐SCLC following induction aPD‐L1 plus platinum doublet chemotherapy. Eligibility patients must meet criteria for the first registration including ESSCLC, no prior radiation or chemotherapy history, age 20 or older, ECOG performance status 0 or 1, and adequate organ function. Induction treatment involves atezolizumab + carboplatin + etoposide or durvalumab + cisplatin / carboplatin + etoposide. Responding patients proceed to the second registration, randomization (1:1 between 30 Gy in 10 fractions of cTRT plus aPD‐L1 maintenance therapy and maintenance therapy only). The cTRT targets metastatic lymph nodes in stations #1‐7 and ipsilateral stations #10‐12 identified at diagnosis. The adjustment factors include response to induction treatment (CR/PR versus SD), presence of brain metastasis (yes versus no), participating institutions, and aPD‐L1 type (atezolizumab versus durvalumab). The primary endpoint is OS, with secondary endpoints being PFS and safety. The study aims to enroll 240 randomized patients, with 330 in the first registration, providing 80%power at a one‐sided 5%significance level to detect a hazard ratio of 0.69 with 3‐year accrual period and 1‐year follow‐up. As of February 6, 2024, 239 patients initiated induction treatment, and 121 have been randomized. This trial is registered at Japan Registry of Clinical Trials as jRCTs031210393 (https://jrct.niph.go.jp/detail/jRCTs031210393).},

abstract = {Introduction: Despite the effectiveness of PD‐L1 inhibitors in combination with platinum‐based chemotherapy as first‐line treatment for extensive‐stage small‐cell lung cancer (ES‐SCLC), most patients still have disease progression and prognosis remains poor. In the IMpower133 study, the addition of atezolizumab (monoclonal anti‐PD‐L1 antibody) to chemotherapy improved median overall survival (mOS) to 12.3 months compared with 10.3 months in the chemotherapy plus placebo arm (HR 0.70; 95% CI: 0.54, 0.91; P=0.007; Horn et al, 2018). Single‐agent lurbinectedin, a selective inhibitor of oncogenic transcription, has shown promising activity in many tumor types, including as second‐line (2L) treatment for SCLC (objective response rate [ORR] by investigator assessment, 35%; Trigo et al, 2020), which led to its approval in the US for patients with metastatic SCLC who have previously received platinum‐based chemotherapy. In the Phase I part of the 2SMALL study, the combination of lurbinectedin and atezolizumab showed promising preliminary anti‐tumor activity (ORR, 57.7%) as a 2L treatment for ES‐SCLC (Ponce Aix et al, SITC 2021). The current study assesses lurbinectedin in combination with atezolizumab as a maintenance treatment for ES‐SCLC in patients who have received atezolizumab plus carboplatin and etoposide as first‐line induction therapy without experiencing disease progression. Methods: IMforte (NCT05091567; GO43104) is a Phase III, randomized, open‐label, multicenter study of atezolizumab plus lurbinectedin compared with atezolizumab alone. The study consists of an induction phase and a randomized maintenance phase. Patients eligible for the induction phase will be ≥ 18 years old and have an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 and measurable disease per the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST) v1.1 criteria. Patients with central nervous system metastases, autoimmune disease or prior anti‐cancer therapy for ES‐SCLC will be excluded. During the induction phase, patients will receive four 21‐day cycles of atezolizumab (1200 mg intravenously [IV]) plus carboplatin and etoposide. Patients must have an ongoing response or stable disease per RECIST 1.1 after the completion of 4 cycles of induction treatment to be randomized into the maintenance phase of the study. In the maintenance phase, patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive either atezolizumab (1200 mg IV) plus lurbinectedin (3.2 mg/m2 IV) or atezolizumab (1200 mg IV) every 3 weeks until disease progression. Independent review facility‐assessed progression‐free survival (PFS) per RECIST 1.1 and OS are the co‐primary endpoints. Secondary endpoints include investigator‐assessed PFS, ORR, duration of response, quality of life and safety/tolerability. Keywords: Atezolizumab, Lurbinectedin, Small‐cell lung cancer},

Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) has long been considered a component of standard treatment in patients with extensive stage disease who respond to chemotherapy. However, in the modern era of magnetic resonance imaging, the role of PCI has become an area of controversy following conflicting level I evidence. Due to conflicting data and toxicity concerns, the routine use of PCI has declined. Recent improvements in systemic disease control with the use of immunotherapy and reductions in the toxicity attributable to PCI with hippocampal avoidance and memantine have reignited the discussion. As such, we present here a narrative review of PCI with a focus on historical milestones, randomized data, risk mitigation and future directions.},

abstract = {Background: In recent years, the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors has led to significant progress in the treatment of extensive‐stage small cell lung cancer. However, there is limited data on the efficacy of immunotherapy in patients with limited‐stage disease (LS‐SCLC). Therefore, we conducted a phase II randomized study to verify the efficacy and safety of Toripalimab consolidation following definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) in patients with LS‐SCLC (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT04418648). Methods: Patients with LS‐SCLC who had achieved complete or partial response after definitive CCRT (including four to six cycles of etoposide and cisplatin, and curative‐intent thoracic radiotherapy) were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive Toripalimab consolidation (240mg intravenously, every 3 weeks for 6 months) or observation. Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) was recommended but not mandatory. The primary endpoint was progression‐free survival (PFS) calculated from randomization, and secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS) and toxicity. Results: As of data cutoff (November 30, 2023), a total of 64 eligible patients (intent‐to‐treat population) were randomly assigned to the Toripalimab group (n = 31) or the observation group (n = 33), respectively. With the median follow‐up of 25 months, PFS was significantly improved with Toripalimab (hazard ratio [95% CI]: 0.47 [0.22‐1.02]; P = 0.04). The median PFS in observation group was 12.3 months (95% CI, 0.04‐24.50), while the median PFS in the Toripalimab group has not been reached. The 24‐month PFS rate was 61.6% (95% CI, 43.0%‐88.3%) in the Toripalimab group and 34.8% (95% CI, 21.5%‐56.3%) in the observation group. The 24‐month OS was 82.7% (95% CI, 65.2%‐100%; P = 0.23) in the Toripalimab group and 59.1%(95% CI, 44.2%‐79.1%) in the observation group. There were 5(16.1%) and 3 (9.1%) patients in the Toripalimab group and observation group experiencing G2+ pneumonitis respectively. No G4+ toxic events occurred in either group. Conclusions: Our preliminary results suggested Toripalimab consolidation following definitive CCRT was effective and tolerable in LS‐SCLC. (Table Presented).},

abstract = {Background Based on two randomized phase III studies, IMPOWER133 and CASPIAN, immune checkpoint inhibitors combined with chemotherapy have shown improved clinical efficacy as first‐line treatment for extensive‐stage small cell lung cancer (ES‐SCLC). This study will describe the real‐world characteristics and outcomes of patients with ES‐SCLC treated with standard chemotherapy with or without PD‐L1 inhibitors. Methods Treatment‐naïve ES‐SCLC patients treated with standard platinum‐based chemotherapy with or without PD‐L1 inhibitors (atezolizumab and durvalumab) were enrolled from 12 sites in China between Jan 2019 and Dec 2021. Analyses of baseline characteristics, survival, treatment‐related adverse effects (TRAEs), and subgroups were conducted. The primary end point was progression‐free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Results 414 ES‐SCLC patients were enrolled, of those 208 patients received durvalumab (66.3%) or atezolizumab (33.7%) combined with chemotherapy and 206 patients only received chemotherapy. In this study, 60.1% of patients had a history of smoking and 24.6% had brain metastases. Of 414 patients, 256 (61.8%) received six or more cycles of chemotherapy (median, 6) and 213 (61.8%) received radiotherapy to any site. Median PFS in PD‐L1 inhibitors plus chemotherapy group or chemotherapy group was 7.2 months (95% CI 6.6–7.8) and 6.4 months (95% CI 5.8–7.0), respectively (P = 0.001), and HR for disease progression was 0.72 (95% CI 0.59–0.89; P = 0.002). The median OS was 20.6 months and 15.9 months, respectively (HR = 0.74, P = 0.020). TRAEs were similar in the two groups, with AE‐related withdrawal rates from 1L therapy of 6.3% in the PD‐L1 inhibitors plus chemotherapy group and 3.4% in the chemotherapy group, including one death from immune‐related pneumonia in the former group. Conclusions In this real‐world study, PD‐L1 inhibitors combined with chemotherapy demonstrated good efficacy and tolerable safety profiles. The clinical characteristics and treatment patterns were markedly different from those in the two RCTs, including receipt of thoracic radiotherapy (tRT) or prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI). The OS benefit and radiotherapy subgroup analysis of ES‐SCLC patients need to be further followed up. Legal entity responsible for the study The authors. Funding Has not received any funding.

abstract = {Introduction: Limited stage small cell lung cancer (LS‐SCLC) is treated with standard of care platinum/etoposide (EP) and thoracic radiation therapy (TRT) with curative intent, however the majority of patients are not cured and median overall survival is approximately 30 months. Addition of atezolizumab to chemotherapy in extensive stage SCLC has improved progression free and overall survival in a non‐curative setting leading to hope that addition of an immune checkpoint inhibitor to standard chemoradiotherapy could benefit LS‐SCLC patients. LU005 is a randomized phase II/III trial of standard concurrent chemoradiation with or without atezolizumab for patients with LS‐SCLC. Methods: Patients are randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to standard EP chemotherapy with concurrent TRT (45 Gy BID or 66 Gy QD) with or without atezolizumab beginning concurrently with TRT, and continued every 3 weeks for up to 12 months. Eligible patients have LS‐SCLC, PS 0‐2, adequate organ function, no concerning comorbidities (including no active autoimmune disease) and are eligible for TRT. Patients are randomized prior to their second cycle of EP and thoracic radiation begins with the second overall cycle of chemotherapy (first cycle of study therapy) in both treatment arms. Prophylactic cranial radiation (PCI) is recommended for patients who respond to treatment. The phase II/III primary endpoints are progression free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) respectively. Secondary endpoints include objective response rates, local and distant disease control, and quality of life/patient reported outcomes assessment. Translational science component includes blood and tissue based immune related assays. Results: This study activated in May 2019. 120 of 506 planned patients have been accrued as of 8/20/2020.

The three active agents, doxorubicin (A) 45 mg/m2 i.v. day 1, cyclophosphamide (C) 1.0 mg/m2 i.v. day 1 and VP16‐213 (E) 50 mg/m2/day i.v. days 1‐5 were given together. The combination (ACE) was given every 21 days without chest irradiation. One hundred and seventy‐four patients have been stratified for extent of disease and randomized on three sequential studies testing ACE vs ACE + MER immunotherapy (38 patients), or ACE vs ACE alternating with CCNU, methotrexate, vincristine and procarbazine (109 patients), or ACE vs ACE II (ACE with continuous VP16‐213 ‐ 100 mg/m2/day X 5 days ‐ 27 patients ‐ ongoing). The immunotherapy and the alternating non‐cross resistant combination have not proven beneficial with respect to response or survival. The ACE combination, regardless of additional treatments, has produced greater than 90% response overall. In limited disease the complete response (CR) frequency is 65%. The median survival for limited disease overall is 14 months and 18 months for patients achieving CR. In extensive disease the CR frequency is 40% with a median survival of 9 months overall and 13 months for patients achieving CR. Response frequency and survival are identical in the first two studies and 20‐30% of patients with limited disease are long‐term survivors with one late relapse (greater than 3 years). Patients who achieved CR had a significantly longer survival regardless of other factors such as performance status or extent of disease. Prophylactic cranial irradiation was demonstrated to be useful in prevention or delaying CNS metastases in patients who achieved CR. The third generation study of high‐dose VP16‐213 infusion seeks to increase the CR frequency. ACE chemotherapy without chest irradiation is a highly effective treatment for all patients with small cell lung cancer and compares favorably with all other studies with or without adjuvant radiotherapy.},

It accounts for about 15% of all new cancers. Lung cancer is the world's leading cause of cancer death with more than 1.6 million new cases diagnosed each year. About 85 percent of lung cancer patients have Non‐small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC ) and are usually diagnosed with advanced disease and have few treatment options and a very low survival rate. Radiotherapy is the treatment of choice in the successful treatment of stage III NSCLC. However, the 5‐year survival for stage III patients treated with radiotherapy alone is less than 10%. Several types of chemotherapy treatments have been investigated, however, progress has been limited. Most patients die from relapsed disease. The peptide telomerase vaccine, GV1001, is under development for use as active immunotherapy in the treatment of cancer. Normally, the immune system is tolerant to self‐proteins and peptides, while being able to react to foreign pathogens. However, cancer cells are degenerated cells and many of their peptides and proteins are self‐proteins or peptides. By using vaccination, the immune tolerance towards a specific peptide or protein can be circumvented.},

abstract = {Background: Small cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) is a rare tumour subtype, and approximately one third of the SCLC patients (pts) present limited disease (LD‐SCLC) with a 5‐year survival rate between 20% and 25%. The standard of care (SOC) is platinum‐based chemotherapy combined with etoposide and thoracic radiotherapy (CRT). While immunotherapy is currently limited to advanced SCLC setting, NSCLC setting suggest that the combination of immunotherapy and radiotherapy may produce a synergistic effect. The relevance of a multimodal strategy including immunotherapy after CRT is therefore currently under investigation, but frail LD‐SCLC pts are often excluded from clinical trials. Thus, DURVALUNG study aims to evaluate the efficacy of durvalumab maintenance specifically in frail LD‐SCLC pts who have not progressed following concomitant or sequential CRT. Trial design: DURVALUNG is an academically‐lead, open‐label, multicentre, randomized phase II trial in previously untreated frail LD‐SCLC pts. Pts will be screened during the CRT and only those achieving a disease control (SD or PR/CR) after the CRT and presenting frail condition (ECOG PS 2, ECOG PS 0‐1 and older than 70 or did not receive a concomitant CRT due to comorbidities) will be randomized 1:1 to receive durvalumab every 4 weeks for 24 months or surveillance as per SOC. Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation will be allowed according to local SOC within 45 days after the end of CRT. 110 pts will be randomized in the study. A safety interim analysis will be performed after the first 15 pts included into the experimental arm for the Data Safety Monitoring Board. The main objective is to evaluate the progression‐free survival (PFS), per investigator, of LD‐SCLC pts on durvalumab arm compared to surveillance. The primary endpoint analysis will be a Cox regression analysis with 90% confidence interval (1‐sided). Secondary objectives are BIRC PFS, overall survival, quality of life, and toxicity. Ancillary studies will be conducted to determine biomarkers of clinical benefit from the durvalumab maintenance, the impact of sarcopenia on outcomes, and the correlation between radiotherapy plan and survival outcomes and toxicities.

abstract = {Introduction: Treatment of advanced stage non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has changed dramatically due to immunotherapy. However, patients without Programmed Death‐Ligand 1 (PD‐L1) protein expression often benefit less from immunotherapy. This trial is designed to test if stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) to a single tumor site can significantly enhance the outcome of patients with advanced stage PD‐L1(‐) NSCLC when added to systemic therapy including immunotherapy. Materials and Methods: Alliance A082002 is based on subgroup analysis from the randomized phase II PEMBRO‐RT trial., PEMBRO‐RT compared pembrolizumab alone or with SBRT and revealed improved progression‐free and overall survival (PFS and OS, respectively) in PD‐L1(‐) patients when adding SBRT (8 Gy x 3 fractions). In A082002, patients without PD‐L1 expression will be randomized to SBRT (8 Gy x3) plus systemic therapy vs. systemic therapy alone. The primary endpoint of the phase II portion of the trial is PFS and will require 100 patients. The primary endpoint of the phase III portion of the trial is OS and will require an additional 284 patients. This trial will clarify whether adding SBRT to systemic therapy can improve PFS and OS in a larger multi‐institutional cohort. Several systemic treatment options are allowed including either immunotherapy alone or chemo‐immunotherapy. Conclusions: This phase II/III Alliance trial A082002 will test whether the addition of SBRT to a single tumor site will enhance the anti‐tumor activity of systemic immunotherapy or chemo‐immunotherapy in patients with stage IV PD‐L1(‐) NSCLC. It is now open in the National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN).},

abstract = {Background: Improvement in radiotherapy techniques and expected outcomes, as well as in understanding the underlying biological mechanisms contributing to its action (immunomodulation in primis), led to the integration of this therapeutical approach in the current management of advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), not only in oncogene‐driven tumors, but also in non‐oncogene addicted NSCLC where the combination of platinum‐based chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab represents nowadays the pivotal strategy. In this light, we have designed a randomized phase II (ESPERa) trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of adding Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) to pembrolizumab‐pemetrexed maintenance in advanced NSCLC patients experiencing disease response or stability after chemo‐immunotherapy induction. Patients and Methods: Advanced non‐oncogene addicted NSCLC patients with ECOG performance status of 0 or 1, who obtained disease response or stability after 4 cycles of platinum‐based chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab will be randomized 2:1 to receive pembrolizumab‐pemetrexed maintenance plus SBRT vs pembrolizumab‐pemetrexed alone. The primary endpoint is progression‐free survival (PFS). Concomitant translational researches will be performed to identify potential prognostic and/or predictive biomarkers, as well as to analyze and monitor tumour microenvironment and tumor‐host interactions. Conclusions: Although available data suggest the safety and efficacy of combining immunotherapy and radiotherapy, their systematic integration in the current first‐line landscape still remains to be explored. If the pre‐planned endpoints of the ESPERa trial will be achieved, the addition of SBRT to pembrolizumab‐pemetrexed maintenance as a strategy to consolidate and ideally improve the awaited benefit could be considered as a promising strategy in NSCLC undergoing first‐line therapy, as well as an interesting approach to be evaluated in other disease setting, as well as in other oncological malignancies where immunotherapy represents nowadays the standard‐of‐care.},

abstract = {Objective Cytokine‐induced killer (CIK) cells have important therapeutic effects in adoptive cell transfer (ACT) for the treatment of various malignancies. In this study, we focused on in vitro expansion of CIK cells and their clinical efficacy in combination with chemotherapy in patients with advanced non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods A total of 64 patients with NSCLC (enrolled from 2011 to 2012), including 32 patients who received chemotherapy alone or with sequential radiotherapy (conventional treatment, control group) and 32 patients who received conventional treatment and sequential CIK infusion (study group), were retrospectively analyzed. The time to progression (TTP), overall survival (OS) and adverse effects were analyzed and the phenotype of lymphocytes in CIK population was also determined by flow cytometry. Results After in vitro expansion, the average percentage of CIK cells was 26.35%. During the 54‐month follow up, the median OS and TTP were significantly longer in the study group than in the control group (P = 0.0189 and P = 0.0129, respectively). The median OS of the ACT ≥ 4 cycles subgroup was significantly longer than that of the ACT < 4 cycles subgroup (P = 0.0316). The percentage of CIK cells in patients who received ≥ 4 cycles of ACT was higher than that in patients treated with < 4 cycles of ACT (P = 0.0376). Notably, CIK cells were difficult to expand in vitro in some patients after the first ACT cycle but became much easier as the treatment cycles increased monthly. Longer treatment interval negatively impacted the expansion of CIK cells. Conclusions Systematic immune levels can be increasingly boosted by reinfusion of ACT. Conventional treatment plus CIK cells is an effective therapeutic strategy to prevent progression and prolong survival of patients with advanced NSCLC.},

abstract = {Small Cell Lung Cancer is an aggressive cancer with poor prognosis and even in limited disease the 5‐year survival is below 20%. To date, immunotherapy with immune‐checkpoint inhibitors for SCLC have made the greatest advances and preliminary data for pembrolizumab, nivolumab and combination of ipilimumab with nivolumab showed promising antitumour activity. We here describe the case of a patient with limited disease SCLC (cT4 pN1cM0; T4:10 cm with contact to the mediastinum, visceral pleura and infiltration of the main left bronchus), who was included in the ETOP 4‐12‐STIMULI trial. The patient underwent standard chemoradiotherapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation achieving a partial response; subsequently the patient was randomized to the investigational arm, with adjuvant ipilimumab. The treatment consisted of four doses of ipilimumab 3 mg/kg every three weeks and thereafter eight doses of ipilimumab 3 mg/kg every six weeks for two years. Follow up was done with FDG‐PET/CT scans every three months. The treatment was well tolerated and the patient experienced no side effects. On the FDG‐PET/CT scans, the primary tumor showed persistence three months after the last dose of ipilimumab, with a size above 7cm, low FDG‐uptake (SUVmax 4.1) and no other tumor manifestation. The case was evaluated at the multidisciplinary thoracic‐tumorboard for resection. Given the unclear metabolic behavior of the large mass and in order to reduce the risk of pneumonitis, the patient underwent a left upper‐lobe resection. The histopathologic analysis showed a necrotic mass with no vital tumor cells, resulting in a ypT0 ypN0 stage, and an immune infiltration. Based on these data, we assume that under immunotherapy an immune reaction occurred leading to the pathological findings as well as the still ongoing complete remission from disease 31 months after diagnosis. The CheckMate 156 showed no efficacy of Ipilimumab alone when added to chemotherapy of extensive SCLC. Based on the CheckMate 012 and 032, with improved efficacy of the combination nivolumab and ipilimumab compared to monotherapy, the STIMULI trial was amended to the combination of nivolumab and Ipilimumab after chemo‐radiation. This is the first report of a complete pathological response after adjuvant ipilimumab for limited disease SCLC. This case shows moreover the potential of a multidisciplinary approach in this setting.},

abstract = {Treatment of small‐cell lung cancer (SCLC) has not been modified since decades: and consists in a chemotherapy (CT) with platin+etoposide+/‐concurrent radiotherapy (RT) and prophylactic cranial irradiation in case of a (near)complete response to therapy. Non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents 85% of all lung cancers and around 50% are metastatic at presentation. Systemic treatment (platin‐based doublets) has been implemented for stage IV NSCLC but also for locally advanced and early stages as a (neo)adjuvant therapy to surgery or RT. By the end of the XXth century, a plateau has been reached with CT in stage IV disease with similar results whatever the drug used in conjunction with platin‐salt. Since the beginning of the XXIst century there have been tremendous innovations in the systemic treatment of NSCLC. First, adjunction of bevacizumab to CT for stage IV non‐squamous cell carcinoma and the use of maintenance therapy have led to an improvement in median survival time (MST) exceeding now one year. Second, targeted therapies proved to be of major interest for patients with EGFR activating mutations leading to a MST>2 years. Other targets of interest have been found such as ALK and ROS1 translocations, V600EBRAF mutations leading to prolonged survival with appropriate treatments. Third, immunotherapy represents now an exciting approach especially for those patients without targetable mutations/translocations. Lung cancer has long been considered as a poor candidate for immunotherapy because of low content of tumor‐infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) compared to other tumors. On the other hand, in case of the presence of TIL the prognosis is better.1 The fact that incidence of lung cancer is especially high in patients who were transplanted2 or in patients with HIV infection3 is against the assumption of lung cancer being non immunogenic. There are two types of immunotherapy : the immune checkpoint blockers which aim at enhancing a T‐cell response directed against tumoral cells and abrogate the immune tolerance and the therapeutic vaccines designed to induce or amplify an immune response directed against tumor‐associated antigens (TAA). The immune checkpoint blockers in current development are anti CTLA4 monoclonal antibodies (ipilimumab), first used in the treatment of melanoma and now investigated in NSCLC and SCLC, anti PD1 (nivolumab, pembrolizumab) or anti PDL1 (avelumab, atezolizumab). All these molecules are now either at an advanced stage of development or already authorized.4 Therapeutic vaccines have already a long story beginning with Coley toxins at the end of the nineteenth century.5 The Coley's toxins, (cultures of streptococci) were infused in patients with bone and soft tissue sarcomas and some impressive regressions were observed. The hypothesis was that the immune reaction provoked by the infusion of the “toxins” present in the infectious material was able to destroy the tumoral cells. However, due to the reluctance of doctors to administer dangerous bacterial culture and the appearance of novel treatments of cancer (CT and RT), the Coley's toxin approach has been abandoned although numerous articles were devoted to this subject.6 Nonspecific vaccines using for example BCG to stimulate innate immunity have been disappointing as well in SCLC7,8 and NSCLC.9 Specific immunotherapy aims at the stimulation of adaptive immunity against the vaccine components and thus induces or amplifies an immune response against TAA. These vaccines are peptides (Tecemotide, MAGE‐A3), cellular vaccines (Belagenpumatucel), or vaccines using viral vector (TG4010). Tecemotide and TG4010 are a MUC1 antigen‐specific cancer immunotherapy. MUC1 is expressed at the apical surface of mucin‐secreting normal epithelial cells of various tissues and can be overexpressed and aberrantly glycosylated in some tumors and thus is an attractive target for immunotherapy. Tecemotide is a liposomal vaccine. In a randomized phase II trial,10 171 NSCLC patients who were not progressing after induction CT or CT‐RT received subcutaneous tecemotide plus best supportive care (BSC) or BSC alone as maintenance therapy. Median survival time (MST) was longer in patients receiving tecemotide (17.2 vs. 13.0 months) but this did not reach statistical significance. As in a post hoc analysis the benefit appeared to be more important for patients with stage IIIB disease, it was decided to perform a phase III study in locally advanced NSCLC11,12 comparing in nonprogressing patients after CT with platin‐based doublet and RT, tecemotide versus placebo. MST was 25.8 months with tecemotide versus 22.4 months with placebo (HR 0.89, 95%CI 0.77‐1.03, p=0.111). In the concurrent CT‐RT subgroup, there was a significant survival benefit in favor of tecemotide whereas in the sequential CT‐RT subgroup, survival did not differ between the two arms. A similar study13 was initiated in Asian people. This trial was prematurely terminated as the sponsor decided to discontinue program with tecemotide in NSCLC MAGE‐A3 is an antigen expressed in 76% of melanoma and in 35% of NSCLC. It is absent from normal tissues except for testis and placenta. This vaccine has been investigated in early stage of NSCLC as an adjuvant treatment. A randomized phase II study14 compared the MAGE‐3A vaccine to a placebo in 182 patients operated of a stage IB or II NSCLC with their tumor expressing MAGE‐A3 antigen. The randomization was on a 2:1 basis. The main objective was to compare the Disease Free Interval (DFI) defined as the time from resection to the date of recurrence (any type) or second primary lung neoplasm. Although there was a trend toward a numerically longer DFI in the MAGE‐A3 vaccine group, the main objective was not met. Nevertheless, even if these trends were by far not significant, the results appear promising to the sponsors and a phase III trial was launched (MAGRIT trial) with the same scheme.15 Unfortunately, the biggest trial ever performed with the inclusion of 2312 NSCLC patients is negative regarding as well the primary objective: disease‐ free survival (DFS) but also the secondary objective, DFS in the group of patients not receiving adjuvant chemotherapy or other subgroups. Belagenpumatucel‐L is a vaccine comprising 4 tranforming growth factor‐b2‐ antisense gene‐modified irradiated allogeneic NSCLC cell lines. A randomized phase III trial16 comparing this vaccine to a placebo was performed after platinumbased CT for stage III/IV disease in non‐progressing patients. This trial was negative with no difference in overall survival and in PFS. However, in a prespecified multivariate analysis, there was an improved survival for patients who were randomized within 12 weeks after CT and for patients who received prior radiation therapy. TG4010 is a suspension of a recombinant modified vaccinia virus strain Ankara coding for the MUC1 TAA and IL2. Feasibility of either upfront combination of TG4010 with cisplatine‐vinorelbine or TG4010 alone until progression has been demonstrated in a phase II study.17 Sixty‐five patients were randomized. Response rate was 30 % in the combined upfront schedule; MST was 12.7 months and one‐year survival rate 53%. Taking into account these results, a phase II randomized study18 comparing CT with cisplatin and gemcitabine to the same CT + TG4010 was performed. One hundred and forty eight patients with stage IIIB or IV disease were included. The primary endpoint was 6‐month PFS with the hypothesis that it will be at least 40% in the combined arm. This objective was met with a 6‐months PFS of 43% compared to 35.1% in the CT alone arm. There was a non‐significant trend toward a higher response rate and a longer time to progression in the combined arm. An exploratory analysis of the subgroups defined by the level of activated NK cells (CD16+CD56+CD69+lymphocytes or TrPAL) shows that a better outcome was observed for those patients with normal level of TrPAL and that the vaccine might be deleterious for those with high level of TrPAL. A phase IIB was then performed to confirm the role of the level of TrPAL.19 222 patients were randomly allocated to CT+TG4010 or CT+placebo. Median PFS was 5.9 months in the TG4010 group versus 5.1 months in the placebo group (HR 0.74, 95%CI 0.55‐0.98, p= 0.019). In patients with TrPAL values less or equal ULN, the HR for PFS was 0.75 (95%CI 0.51‐1.03) with a posterior probability of HR being <1 of 98.4% and thus the primary endpoint was met. In patients with high level of TrPAL, there was no deleterious effect but no benefit as the HR for PFS was 0.77 (95%CI 0.42‐1.40). As a conclusion, all studies with vaccines have been quite disappointing. To the best of my knowledge, the only vaccine still under investigation remains TG4010, but phase III trial is not implemented at this time. In each vaccine study some efficacy has been observed in subgroups of NSCLC patients but mostly in post hoc analyses. All vaccine studies have shown that there are no safety problems. The fact that nowadays, considerable interest has been developed toward checkpoint inhibitors, probably explains the disaffection toward vaccines. Hopefully it will be only transient and the already long story of therapeutic vaccines will continue.},

abstract = {Objective To investigate the efficacy and safety of anlotinib combined with docetaxel in the second‐line treatment of extensive‐stage small cell lung cancer (ES‐SCLC). Methods A total of 117 patients with ES‐SCLC who progressed or relapsed after first‐line EP±immunization regimen were enrolled in Fuyang People's Hospital (40 cases), Fuyang Second People's Hospital (37 cases) and Taihe Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine (40 cases) from 2020‐01‐01 to 2022‐03‐31. They were randomly divided into observation group (59 cases) and control group (58 cases). Observation group:patients were given anlotinib hydrochloride capsule (12 mg orally, once a day, 2 weeks of medication followed by suspension for 1 week, every 21 days for 1 cycle) combined with docetaxel (75 mg/m2, intravenous infusion 1 h,d1,every 21 days for 1 cycle). Control group: Patients were given docetaxel (75 mg/m2,1 h intravenous infusion, d1, every 21 days for 1 cycle). The short‐term efficacy, progression‐free survival(PFS), overall survival (OS), and adverse reactions of the two groups were observed. The effect of different prognostic factors on the survival of patients was evaluated. Results The median follow‐up time was 12.5 months until November 1, 2022. The objective response rate(ORR) of the observation group and the control group was 61. 0 % (36/59) and 25. 9 % (15/58), respectively. The disease control rate(DCR) was 91. 5% (54/59) and 77. 6 % (45/58), respectively, with statistical significance (χ2 = 14.700, P<0. 001; χ2 = 4. 366, P=0. 037). Median PFS were 6.1 and 4.2 months, and median OS were 9. 2 and 6. 7 months, respectively, the differences were statistically significant (χ2=47. 331, P<0. 001; χ2=31. 101, P<0. 001). Univariate analysis showed that first‐line immunotherapy could prolong PFS and OS in observation group (P<0. 001), ECOG score =1 and brain metastasis were associated with shorter PFS and OS (P<0. 001). Subgroup survival analysis showed that in patients with BMS, median PFS(4. 9 months vs 3. 0 months, P<0. 002) and median OS(8. 2 months vs 3. 7 months,P<0. 001) after whole brain radiotherapy in the observation group were both longer than those in the control group. Common adverse reactions in the two groups were fatigue, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, leukopenia, neutropenia, etc. Hand‐foot syndrome, hypothyroidism and hypertriglyceridemia in the observation group were more common in the control group, with no statistical significance (P>0. 05). The incidence of hypertension in the observation group was higher than that in the control group, with statistical significance (P<0. 05). The occurrence of adverse reactions was mainly Grade 1 to Grade 2 in the two groups, with low incidence of Grade 3. No Grade 4 adverse reactions or treatment‐related death was observed, which could be controlled by symptomatic treatment or anrotinib reduction. Conclusion Anlotinib combined with docetaxel can be used as a safe and effective second‐line treatment option for patients with ES‐SCLC, and has a trend of improving prognosis. It is worth expanding the sample size to continue clinical research.},

abstract = {Background: Overall survival (OS) remains poor in pts with advanced SCLC, and treatment options are limited for pts who relapse after first‐line PT‐DC. Nivolumab, a fully human IgG4 programmed death‐1 (PD‐1) immune checkpoint inhibitor, has demonstrated superior survival and favorable safety over docetaxel in two phase III trials in previously treated advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). These results led to the approval of nivolumab in the US for previously treated metastatic NSCLC and in the EU for previously treated squamous (SQ) NSCLC. In a phase I/II trial (CheckMate 032) in pts with advanced/metastatic solid tumors, nivolumab monotherapy showed antitumor activity with durable tumor responses in pts with SCLC whose disease progressed after ≥1 prior therapy. In this study, responses were observed regardless of programmed death ligand‐1 (PD‐L1) expression or platinum sensitivity/resistance. Adverse event profiles of nivolumab were manageable and favorable compared to safety profiles of historical topotecan or amrubicin data. These encouraging data have led to a phase III trial, CheckMate 331, designed to evaluate nivolumab monotherapy versus chemotherapy in pts with relapsed SCLC. Methods: Adult pts with limited or extensive disease SCLC, disease progression or recurrence after first‐line PT‐DC or chemoradiation therapy, and ECOG performance status 0‐1 are eligible. Pts with symptomatic and active brain metastases are ineligible. The primary endpoint is OS. Secondary endpoints include progression‐free survival and objective response rate. An estimated 480 pts will be enrolled and randomized 1:1 to nivolumab or chemotherapy (topotecan in the US or EU, and topotecan or amrubicin in Japan).},

Trial objective: To explore the safety and primary efficacy of hypofraction radiotherapy followed by immune checkpoint inhibitors for stage III locally advanced non‐small cell lung cancer. Trial Design: To enroll 36 patients diagnosed with stage III locally advanced non‐small cell lung cancer to receive hypofraction radiotherapy (18 patients receiving high dose of 60‐68 (Gray, Gy) /15‐17 (fraction, f) and 18 patients receiving low dose of 48Gy/12f) followed by 1‐year maintenance of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Inclusion Criteria: a. 18‐70 years old; b. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 0‐1; c. non‐small cell lung cancer including squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma, large‐cell carcinoma; d. wild‐type of driven genes; e. stage III (AJCC 8th Edition) confirmed by cranial MRI, chest CT, abdominal ultrasonograph, bone scan or cranial MRI and Positron Emission Tomography (PET‐CT); f. surgically unresectable or deny of surgery; g. signature of inform consent. Exclusion Criteria: a. younger than 18 years old or older than 70 years old; b. ECOG>1; c. small‐cell lung cancer and other neuroendocrine carcinoma including typical or atypical carcinoid, large‐cell neuroendocrine carcinoma; d. mutant type of driven genes; e. non stage III (AJCC 8th Edition) confirmed by cranial MRI, chest CT, abdominal ultrasonograph, bone scan or cranial MRI and PET‐CT; f. surgically resectable; g. no signature of inform consent. Staging Examination before Radiotherapy: a. ECOG scoring. b. Cranial contrast MRI and PET‐CT, or cranial contrast MRI (preferred), chest contrast CT, abdominal ultrasonography and bone scan. c. Bronchoscopy for centrally‐located lung cancer. d. Staging examination is mandatory after inductive chemotherapy & chemotherapy with immunotherapy. e. Pulmonary function test. Inductive therapy before radiotherapy: Chemotherapy or chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy is allowed as inductive therapy. Detailed regimen could refer to NCCN guidelines. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are not allowed as inductive therapy. Randomization: Patients would be randomly assigned to high dose group and low dose group using random number table method. Radiotherapy CT simulation: 4‐Dimensional CT (4D‐CT) with intravenous contrast is recommended for simulation. Scan thickness should be less than 5 mm. Thermal mask or vacuum bag is recommended. Target Delineation: Considering hypofraction and involved field irradiation (IFI), only Internal Tumor Volume (ITV) should be delineated without the need to delineate Clinical Tumor Volume (CTV). Delineation of ITV: ITV should include pulmonary gross tumor and metastatic mediastinal lymph nodes. PET‐CT registration with simulation CT is recommended for patients with obstructive atelectasis. For patients with suspected mediastinal lymph nodes, Endobronchial Ultrasound‐guided Transbronchial Needle Aspiration (EBUS‐TBNA) is recommended. Production of Planning Tumor Volume (PTV): Low Dose Hypofraction Arm (48Gy/12f) PTV: PTV is produced by a margin of 5 mm added to ITV. Modification of PTV is suggested to respect anatomic boundary. High Dose Hypofraction Arm (60‐68Gy/15‐17f) PTV: Planning Tumor Volume (PTV) is produced by a margin of 5 mm added to ITV. Modification of PTV is suggested to respect anatomic boundary. For patients with ITV abutting esophagus, the technique of Esophagus‐Sparing Simultaneous Integrated Boost (ES‐SIB) should be utilized. PTV should be modified not to cover esophagus to ensure that the maximum dose to esophagus should be ≤ 45Gy. The dose to PTV in adjacent to esophagus could be compromised (D99% of PTV should be ≥ 51Gy). Dosimetric Limitation: 95% prescription dose should cover 100% PTV and 95% PTV should receive 100% prescription dose. Total Lung: V20<25%, Dmean<13Gy, V5<50%. Spinal Cord: Dmax<40Gy. Heart: V30<40%, Dmean<25Gy. Treatment Implementation: Radiotherapy is implemented every day. Cone‐beam CT should utilized every day to minimize set‐up error. Concurrent Chemotherapy: If patients have received over 4 cycles of inductive chemotherapy with or without immunotherapy, no concurrent chemotherapy is needed. If patients have received less than 4 cycles of inductive chemotherapy with or without immunotherapy, concurrent chemotherapy is needed to ensure 4 cycles of chemotherapy. Adenocarcinoma: Pemetrexed combined with platinum is recommended. Squamous‐cell lung cancer: Etoposide combined with platinum is recommended. One month after completion of radiotherapy, chest CT and abdominal ultrasonography should be undertaken. After exclusion of disease progression and grade 2 or more radiation‐induced pneumonitis, consolidative immunotherapy should be started. Durvalumab maintenance for one year is recommended. Follow‐up: Patients should be follow‐up every three months right after the completion of radiotherapy to 3 years after radiotherapy. Then follow‐up every half year is allowed to 5 years after radiotherapy. After 5 years, follow‐up every year is appropriate. In follow‐up, chest CT and abdominal ultrasonography should be implemented. Cranial MRI should be performed every half year for patients with adenocarcinoma. Bone scan should be undertaken every year for all patients. Primary Endpoint: Rate of radiation‐induced pneumonitis, esophagitis, myelosuppression (CTCAE V4.0). Secondary Endpoint: 1‐year local‐regional control rate, 1‐year progression‐free survival rate, 1‐year overall survival rate (RECIST v1.1).},

abstract = {Background Preclinical studies have found radiotherapy enhances antitumour immune responses. We aimed to assess disease control and pulmonary toxicity in patients who previously received radiotherapy for non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC) before receiving pembrolizumab. Methods We assessed patients with advanced NSCLC treated on the phase 1 KEYNOTE‐001 trial at a single institution (University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA). Patients were aged 18 years or older, had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 1 or less, had adequate organ function, and no history of pneumonitis. Patients received pembrolizumab at a dose of either 2 mg/kg of bodyweight or 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks, or 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks, until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or other protocol‐defined reasons for discontinuation. Disease response and pulmonary toxicity were prospectively assessed by Immune‐related Response Criteria and Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. The primary objective of the KEYNOTE‐001 trial was to assess the safety, side‐effect profile, and antitumour activity of pembrolizumab. For our secondary analysis, patients were divided into subgroups to compare patients who previously received radiotherapy with patients who had not. Our primary objective was to determine whether previous radiotherapy affected progression‐free survival, overall survival, and pulmonary toxicity in the intention‐to‐treat population. The KEYNOTE‐001 trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01295827. Findings Between May 22, 2012, and July 11, 2014, 98 patients were enrolled and received their first cycle of pembrolizumab. One patient was lost to follow‐up. 42 (43%) of 97 patients had previously received any radiotherapy for the treatment of NSCLC before the first cycle of pembrolizumab. 38 (39%) of 97 patients received extracranial radiotherapy and 24 (25%) of 97 patients received thoracic radiotherapy. Median follow‐up for surviving patients was 32·5 months (IQR 29·8–34·1). Progression‐free survival with pembrolizumab was significantly longer in patients who previously received any radiotherapy than in patients without previous radiotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] 0·56 [95% CI 0·34–0·91], p=0·019; median progression‐free survival 4·4 months [95% CI 2·1–8·6] vs 2·1 months [1·6–2·3]) and for patients who previously received extracranial radiotherapy compared with those without previous extracranial radiotherapy (HR 0·50 [0·30–0·84], p=0·0084; median progression‐free survival 6·3 months [95% CI 2·1–10·4] vs 2·0 months [1·8–2·1]). Overall survival with pembrolizumab was significantly longer in patients who previously received any radiotherapy than in patients without previous radiotherapy (HR 0·58 [95% CI 0·36–0·94], p=0·026; median overall survival 10·7 months [95% CI 6·5–18·9] vs 5·3 months [2·7–7·7]) and for patients who previously received extracranial radiotherapy compared with those without previous extracranial radiotherapy (0·59 [95% CI 0·36–0·96], p=0·034; median overall survival 11·6 months [95% CI 6·5–20·5] vs 5·3 months [3·0–8·5]). 15 (63%) of 24 patients who had previously received thoracic radiotherapy had any recorded pulmonary toxicity versus 29 (40%) of 73 patients with no previous thoracic radiotherapy. Three (13%) patients with previous thoracic radiotherapy had treatment‐related pulmonary toxicity compared with one (1%) of those without; frequency of grade 3 or worse treatment‐related pulmonary toxicities was similar (one patient in each group). Interpretation Our data suggest that previous treatment with radiotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC results in longer progression‐free survival and overall survival with pembrolizumab treatment than that seen in patients who did not have previous radiotherapy, with an acceptable safety profile. Further clinical trials investigating this combination are needed to determine the optimal treatment strategy for patients with advanced NSCLC. Funding US National Institutes of Health.},

abstract = {Stage III locally advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (LA NSCLC) comprises the most heterogeneous group of patients, accounts for one‐third of patients with lung cancer, and is unresectable at presentation. Multiple treatment approaches have evolved over the past few decades focusing on timing of chemoradiation (concurrent vs. sequential) and sequencing of therapy (induction vs. consolidation). Concurrent chemoradiation (CCRT) emerged as the standard of care for the majority of the patients worldwide. Despite improvements in median and overall survival (OS) using the concurrent approach, the rate of distant failure remains high. Consolidation with chemotherapy or targeted agents, adding more radiation dose, or induction chemotherapy did not improve OS. With continued research on defining optimal radiation doses and schedules and integrating novel systemic agents, immunotherapy consolidation has renewed optimism. Synergistic use of radiation and immunotherapy can prevent micrometastatic disease and reduce local failure and may have an abscopal effect in addition to survival benefits. The PACIFIC study reported an absolute progression‐free survival benefit of 11.2 months with durvalumab consolidation after standard CCRT compared with placebo. The OS data with durvalumab consolidation are encouraging. Durvalumab is the only approved immunotherapy for unresectable stage III LA NSCLC. Improved survival confirms the definitive role of durvalumab as an effective adjuvant therapy after CCRT with no new safety signals. However, the potential mechanisms driving interaction between immunotherapy and chemoradiotherapy require definitive investigation. These mechanisms may help define the timing of immunotherapy initiation as neoadjuvant, adjuvant, or consolidation and maintenance therapy after progression.

abstract = {Background PRIMALung is an EORTC‐sponsored study. Primary objective is to show that overall survival with brain MRI surveillance alone is non‐inferior to brain MRI surveillance combined with PCI in patients with SCLC. PCI is currently SOC in most institutions, but can be associated with neurocognitive toxicity and impact quality of life. 600 patients will be recruited from 50 EORTC centres in 10 countries. This study is currently recruiting and will play an important role in clarifying whether MRI surveillance is a viable strategy in SCLC. Furthermore, it will answer important questions about the role of PCI in the era of immunotherapy, particularly in ES‐SCLC. Trial design Key eligibility: ECOG performance status ≤2 patients with SCLC (Limited or Extensive‐Stage, stage I–IV) who did not progress after (≤16 weeks from day 1 of last cycle of chemotherapy to randomisation) completed standard therapy. Absence of progression, brain metastases or leptomeningeal disease after completing therapy. Trial Interventions: Patients will be randomised 1:1 to receive brain MRI surveillance with or without PCI (25 Gy in 10 fractions). Primary objective ‐ to show that overall survival with brain MRI surveillance alone is non‐inferior to brain MRI surveillance combined with PCI. Secondary objectives ‐cognitive failure‐free survival, quality of life and acute/late toxicities according to CTCAE v5.0. The trial was open to recruitment on 27/10/2022. Three countries open to date (Belgium, Switzerland, UK). Further sites in France, Poland and Austria will be open to recruitment Q1 2023.

abstract = {Background: Therapeutic options for small‐cell lung cancer (SCLC) remain limited, with etoposide/platinum (EP) as the standard first‐line chemotherapy regimen. However, patients with extensive‐stage (ES)‐SCLC experience high relapse rates within months after initial therapy. Pembrolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against PD‐1, has shown antitumor activity as monotherapy in heavily pretreated patients with PD‐L1epositive SCLC in the phase 1b KEYNOTE‐028 study. KEYNOTE‐604 (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03066778) evaluates EP plus either pembrolizumab or placebo as first‐line therapy for ES‐SCLC. Method: Not applicable. Result: Not applicable. Conclusion: In this international, double‐blind, phase 3 trial, adults with newly diagnosed ES‐SCLC, ECOG PS ≤1, and no previous systemic therapy for SCLC are randomized 1:1 to receive either EP plus a 200‐mg fixed dose of pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) once every 3 weeks (Q3W) or EP plus placebo IV Q3W. Randomization is stratified by the chosen platinum therapy (carboplatin vs cisplatin), ECOG PS (0 vs 1), and baseline lactate dehydrogenase concentration (≤ upper limit of normal [ULN] vs > ULN). Study treatment includes a total of 4 cycles of EP and 2 years of pembrolizumab/placebo and continues until documented PD, intolerable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. Patients with a response after 4 cycles of EP plus placebo or pembrolizumab may receive prophylactic cranial irradiation. Patients who complete 2 years of pembrolizumab treatment or stop pembrolizumab for reasons other than PD/intolerability, but subsequently have documented PD confirmed by blinded independent review, may receive an additional 1 year of pembrolizumab provided that no other systemic therapy has been administered. Patients must meet the eligibility criteria for retreatment; patients in the placebo arm are not eligible for treatment with pembrolizumab at the time of PD. Tumor response is assessed every 6 weeks for 48 weeks, and every 9 weeks thereafter by RECIST version 1.1 by blinded independent central review. AEs occurring during treatment and 30 days thereafter (90 days for serious AEs) are graded per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. Primary endpoints are PFS and OS. Secondary endpoints are ORR, duration of response, safety, and patient‐reported outcomes. Approximately 430 patients will be enrolled.},

abstract = {Background: Limited stage small cell lung cancer (LS‐SCLC) is treated with standard of care platinum/etoposide (EP) and thoracic radiation therapy (TRT) with curative intent, however the majority of patients are not cured and median overall survival is approximately 30 months. Addition of atezolizumab to chemotherapy in extensive stage SCLC has improved progression free and overall survival in a non‐curative setting leading to hope that addition of an immune checkpoint inhibitor to standard chemoradiotherapy could benefit LS‐SCLC patients. LU005 is a randomized phase II/III trial of standard concurrent chemoradiation with or without atezolizumab for patients with LSSCLC. Methods: Patients are randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to standard EP chemotherapy with concurrent TRT (45 Gy BID or 66 Gy QD) with or without atezolizumab beginning concurrently with TRT, and continued every 3 weeks for up to 12 months. Eligible patients have LS‐SCLC, PS 0‐2, adequate organ function, no concerning comorbidities (including no active autoimmune disease) and are eligible for TRT. Patients are randomized prior to their second cycle of EP and thoracic radiation begins with the second overall cycle of chemotherapy (first cycle of study therapy) in both treatment arms. Prophylactic cranial radiation (PCI) is recommended for patients who respond to treatment. The phase II/III primary endpoints are progression free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) respectively. Secondary endpoints include objective response rates, local and distant disease control, and quality of life/patient reported outcomes assessment. Translational science component includes blood and tissue based immune related assays. This study activated in May 2019. 50 of 506 planned patients have been accrued as of 2/1/2020.},

abstract = {Background: Immune checkpoint inhibitors combined with chemotherapy have significant clinical benefits in extensive‐stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC). However, for patients with limited‐disease SCLC (LD‐SCLC), the data on immunotherapy combined with chemoradiotherapy is insufficient. Methods: In this open‐label, multi‐center, phase 2 trial, we randomly 1: 1 assigned patients with previously untreated LD‐SCLC to receive camrelizumab combined with chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) and camrelizumab consolidation therapy or standard chemoradiotherapy. Patients with ECOG performance status of 0 to 1, and adequate organ function were eligible. For thoracic radiation, 45 Gy in 3 weeks (1.5 Gy, BID) was given on the first day of the third cycle of chemotherapy. An etoposide plus platinumbased regimen was given 4 cycles in total. Patients who had a good response to initial treatment were offered prophylactic cranial irradiation. The primary endpoint was the 1‐year progression‐free survival rate. We assumed that the 1‐year PFS rate in the experimental group was expected to reach 65% compared to chemoradiotherapy alone group 45%, and planned to enroll 112 patients with 56 in each group. Results: Up to date, we have enrolled 40 patients. The median follow‐up was 10.6 months. Safety was evaluated in all treated patients. No Grade 5 adverse event was observed. Grade 3 or 4 treatment‐related adverse events occurred in 58.8% of the patients in the camrelizumab plus chemoradiotherapy and in 52.9% of those in the chemoradiotherapy alone group. The most frequent grade 3 or 4 adverse events were hematologic toxicities (70.6% vs. 58.8%). Acute esophagitis and pneumonitis of grade 3 occurred in both groups were 1/17 (5.9%) and 1/17 (5.9%), respectively. In the experimental group, only one patient was developed grade 3 immune pneumonia 1/17 (5.9%). The 1‐year PFS rate was 54.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 19.5%‐89.6%) with camrelizumab plus chemoradiotherapy and 44.4% (95% CI 3.9%‐88.0%) with chemoradiotherapy alone. Among the 17 patients who received camrelizumab, the median PFS time was not reached, as compared with 14.35 (95% CI, 8.15‐20.91) months among the 17 patients with chemoradiotherapy alone. Conclusions: In patients with LD‐SCLC, the addition of camrelizumab to chemoradiotherapy did not increase the incidence of adverse events. Camrelizumab plus chemoradiotherapy resulted in an encouraging 1‐year PFS rate. Larger sample sizes and longer follow‐up times are required to validate our preliminary results.},

abstract = {Purpose: Roughly 20% of patients with non‐small‐cell lung cancer exhibit locally advanced, unresectable, stage III disease. Concurrent platinum‐based chemoradiotherapy is the backbone treatment, which is followed by maintenance immunotherapy, yet with poor long‐term prognosis. This phase II trial (IFCT‐0803) sought to evaluate whether adding cetuximab to cisplatin and pemetrexed chemoradiotherapy would improve its efficacy in these patients. Materials and methods: Eligible patients received weekly cetuximab (loading dose 400 mg/m2 day 1; subsequent weekly 250 mg/m2 doses until two weeks postradiotherapy). Chemotherapy comprised cisplatin (75 mg/m2) and pemetrexed (500 mg/m2), both delivered on day 1 of a 21‐day cycle of maximally four. Irradiation with maximally 66 Gy started on day 22. Disease control rate at week 16 was the primary endpoint. Results: One hundred and six patients were included (99 eligible patients). Compliance exceeded 95% for day 1 of chemotherapy cycles 1 to 4, with 76% patients receiving the 12 planned cetuximab doses. Maximal grade 3 toxicity occurred in 63% patients, and maximal grade 4 in 9.6%. The primary endpoint involving the first 95 eligible patients comprised two (2.1%) complete responses, 57 (60.0%) partial responses, and 27 (28.4%) stable diseases. This 90.5% disease control rate (95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 84.6%–96.4%) was achieved at week 16. After median 63.0‐month follow‐up, one‐year and two‐year survival rates were 75.8% and 59.5%. Median overall survival was 35.8 months (95% CI: 23.5–NR), and median progression‐free survival 14.4 months (95% CI: 11.2–18.8), with one‐year and two‐year progression‐free survival rates of 57.6% and 34.3%. Conclusion: These survival rates compare favourably with published data, thus justifying further development of cetuximab‐based induction chemoradiotherapy.},

abstract = {Purpose Nivolumab, a programmed death‐1 (PD‐1) immune checkpoint inhibitor antibody, has demonstrated improved survival over docetaxel in previously treated advanced non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC). First‐line monotherapy with nivolumab for advanced NSCLC was evaluated in the phase I, multicohort, Checkmate 012 trial. Methods Fifty‐two patients received nivolumab 3 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks until progression or unacceptable toxicity; postprogression treatment was permitted per protocol. The primary objective was to assess safety; secondary objectives included objective response rate (ORR) and 24‐week progression‐free survival (PFS) rate; overall survival (OS) was an exploratory end point. Results Any‐grade treatment‐related adverse events (AEs) occurred in 71% of patients, most commonly: fatigue (29%), rash (19%), nausea (14%), diarrhea (12%), pruritus (12%), and arthralgia (10%). Ten patients (19%) reported grade 3 to 4 treatment‐related AEs; grade 3 rash was the only grade 3 to 4 event occurring in more than one patient (n = 2; 4%). Six patients (12%) discontinued because of a treatment‐related AE. The confirmed ORR was 23% (12 of 52), including four ongoing complete responses. Nine of 12 responses (75%) occurred by first tumor assessment (week 11); eight (67%) were ongoing (range, 5.3+ to 25.8+ months) at the time of data lock. ORR was 28% (nine of 32) in patients with any degree of tumor PD‐ligand 1 expression and 14% (two of 14) in patients with no PD‐ligand 1 expression. Median PFS was 3.6 months, and the 24‐week PFS rate was 41% (95% CI, 27 to 54). Median OS was 19.4 months, and the 1‐year and 18‐month OS rates were 73% (95% CI, 59 to 83) and 57% (95% CI, 42 to 70), respectively. Conclusion First‐line nivolumab monotherapy demonstrated a tolerable safety profile and durable responses in first‐line advanced NSCLC.},

abstract = {Introduction: PRIMALung is an EORTC‐sponsored study, endorsed in the UK by Cancer Research UK. Primary objective is to show that overall survival with brain MRI surveillance alone is non‐inferior to brain MRI surveillance combined with PCI in patients with SCLC. PCI is currently SOC in most UK institutions, but can be associated with neurocognitive toxicity and impact quality of life. 600 patients will be recruited from 50 EORTC centres in 10 countries, including 8 UK participating sites aiming to recruit 76 patients. Methods: Key eligibility: Diagnosis of SCLC (Limited or Extensive‐ Stage, stage I‐IV). Standard therapy completed prior to randomisation. Absence of progression, brain metastases or leptomeningeal disease after completing therapy. ≤ 16 weeks from day 1 of last cycle of chemotherapy to randomisation. ECOG performance status ≤ 2. Trial Interventions: Patients will be randomised 1:1 to receive brain MRI surveillance with or without PCI (25Gy in 10 fractions). Primary objective: to show that overall survival with brain MRI surveillance alone is non‐inferior to brain MRI surveillance combined with PCI. Secondary objectives: cognitive failure‐free survival, quality of life and acute/late toxicities according to CTCAE v5.0. Results: Open to recruitment 27/10/2022. 3 countries open to date (Belgium, Switzerland, UK). Conclusion: This study is currently recruiting and will play an important role in clarifying whether MRI surveillance is a viable strategy in SCLC. Furthermore, it will answer important questions about the role of PCI in the era of immunotherapy, particularly in ES‐SCLC.

abstract = {In recent years, the survival rate after diagnosis of non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has improved with advances in treatment. In terms of 5‐year average overall survival (OS) by stage at the time of diagnosis, OS decreases significantly from stage IB to IIIA NSCLC, with 68% for stage IB, 53‐60% for stage II, and 36% for stage IIIA. How to optimize the perioperative treatment strategy to reduce postoperative recurrence and prolong the survival of patients has raised great concern in early and mid‐stage NSCLC. Radiotherapy combined with immunotherapy is suggested for advanced NSCLC in preclinical basic studies and recent clinical trials. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) at 8 Gy × 3 Fx plays an effective immunoregulated role and can further enhance the antitumor immune response promoted by immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Although little is known about the optimal SBRT dose and fraction pattern, 6 Gy × 5 Fx or 8‐9 Gy × 3 Fx have shown effectiveness in clinical studies.},

Careful intraoperative staging was performed in all patients. Disease‐free interval was significantly prolonged in the chemotherapy group (p=0.032). After 7.5 years of follow‐up, the difference in time to recurrence and cancer deaths remains statistically significant. Another study compared CAP chemotherapy plus radiotherapy with radiotherapy alone in advanced stages II and III resected NSCLC. Again, the chemotherapy arm had significantly increased disease‐free survival.

Method: Patients with previously untreated ES‐SCLC (ECOG PS 0/1) were randomised (1:1:1) to durvalumab 1500 mg + EP q3w; durvalumab 1500 mg + tremelimumab 75 mg + EP q3w; or EP q3w. Patients in immunotherapy arms received up to 4 cycles of EP followed by maintenance durvalumab until progression. Patients in the EP arm received up to 6 cycles of EP and prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI), at the investigator’s discretion. Investigator’s choice of cisplatin or carboplatin was allowed across all arms and was a stratification factor at randomisation. The primary endpoint was OS. Data cutoff: 11 March 2019. Result: 268 patients were randomised to D+EP and 269 to EP. Baseline characteristics were well balanced between arms. In the EP arm, 56.8% of patients received 6 cycles of EP. At the interim analysis, D+EP significantly improved OS compared to EP with a HR of 0.73 (95% CI, 0.591‐0.909; p=0.0047); mOS 13.0 versus 10.3 months, respectively. 33.9% of patients were alive at 18 months with D+EP versus 24.7% with EP. Secondary endpoints of PFS and ORR were also improved with D+EP compared to EP: PFS HR 0.78 (95% CI, 0.645‐0.936); mPFS 5.1 versus 5.4 months; 12‐month PFS rate 17.5% versus 4.7%; investigator‐assessed ORR (RECIST v1.1; unconfirmed) 79.5% versus 70.3% (odds ratio, 1.64 [95% CI, 1.106‐2.443]). The incidences of grade 3/4 AEs (61.5% versus 62.4%) and AEs leading to discontinuation (9.4% each) were similar between arms; the incidence of haematological toxicities was numerically higher in the EP arm. The durvalumab + tremelimumab + EP arm continues blinded to final analysis. Conclusion: The addition of durvalumab to EP as first‐line treatment for ES‐SCLC significantly improved OS (27% reduction in risk of death) versus a robust control arm that permitted up to 6 cycles of EP and PCI. Of note, this chemo‐immunotherapy regimen offers flexibility in platinum choice (carboplatin or cisplatin), reflecting current clinical practice for this challenging disease. No new safety signals were identified. Keywords: durvalumab, SCLC, CASPIAN},

abstract = {Background: In unselected patients (pts) with extensive‐stage small cell lung cancer (ES‐SCLC), the addition of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) to chemotherapy resulted in a modest improvement in OS. In a retrospective analysis of a study with veliparib (PARP inhibitor [PARPi]) and temozolomide in patients with SCLC, Schlafen‐11 (SLFN11) predicted PFS and OS benefit for the addition of PARPi. We evaluated whether the addition of PARPi (talazoparib) to standard‐of‐care maintenance ICI (atezolizumab) following frontline chemoimmunotherapy improved outcomes in pts with SLFN11‐positive ESSCLC. Methods: Participants with ES‐SCLC expressing SLFN11 (H‐score ≥ 1, evaluated centrally at MDACC) were randomized to maintenance atezolizumab (A) versus atezolizumab plus talazoparib (AT) following frontline chemotherapy and A. Randomization was stratified by Zebrod PS (0‐1 vs 2) and use of consolidation thoracic radiation. The primary endpoint was PFS, and secondary endpoints included ORR, OS, and toxicity. The primary analysis was done using a 1‐sided 10% level stratified log‐rank test. Target sample size was 94 pts. Results: From June 2020 to December 2022, 309 pts were screened, of which 204 of 259 (79%) with evaluable tissue were SLFN11 positive, and 106 were randomized (52 A, 54 AT). Median follow up time is 5 months. Median age was 67 (45‐84); 51 (48%) were females; 94 (89%) were white,102 (96%) were PS 0‐1, and 26 (25%) had radiation prior to randomization. With 80 PFS events reported, PFS was significantly improved with AT (hazard ratio [80% CI]: 0.70 [0.52‐0.94]; p = 0.056). Median PFS was 2.8 months (80% CI 2.0‐2.9) for A and 4.2 months (80% CI 2.8‐4.7) for AT. OS was not different (hazard ratio [80% CI]: 1.17 [0.80‐1.71]; p = 0.30). Median OS was 8.5 months (80 %CI 7.4‐12.7) for A and 9.4 months (80% CI 8.1‐14.2) for AT. ORR was 16% (5/32, 80% CI 8‐27%) for A and 12% (4/34, 80% CI 5‐22%) for AT. Grade 3 or greater treatment related nonhematological adverse events (AEs) occurred in 13% pts in A and 15% in AT. Hematological AEs occurred 4% in A compared to 50% pts in AT (Expected for T) (p<0.001). There were no treatment related grade 5 events. One participant on AT experienced grade 3 febrile neutropenia. The majority of grade 3 AEs were due to anemia (2% in A and 37% in AT). Only three pts discontinued treatment due to toxicity (2 in A and 1 in AT). Conclusions: This study met its primary endpoint demonstrating that maintenance AT improved PFS in SLFN11‐selected patients with ES‐SCLC. Hematologic toxicity was increased with AT as expected, with majority being grade 3 anemia. This study demonstrates the feasibility of conducting biomarker selected trials in SCLC, paving the way for future evaluation of novel therapies in selected SCLC populations.},

abstract = {Background: Previous phase 2 trials of neoadjuvant anti‐PD‐1 or anti‐PD‐L1 monotherapy in patients with early‐stage non‐small‐cell lung cancer have reported major pathological response rates in the range of 15–45%. Evidence suggests that stereotactic body radiotherapy might be a potent immunomodulator in advanced non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In this trial, we aimed to evaluate the use of stereotactic body radiotherapy in patients with early‐stage NSCLC as an immunomodulator to enhance the anti‐tumour immune response associated with the anti‐PD‐L1 antibody durvalumab. Methods: We did a single‐centre, open‐label, randomised, controlled, phase 2 trial, comparing neoadjuvant durvalumab alone with neoadjuvant durvalumab plus stereotactic radiotherapy in patients with early‐stage NSCLC, at NewYork‐Presbyterian and Weill Cornell Medical Center (New York, NY, USA). We enrolled patients with potentially resectable early‐stage NSCLC (clinical stages I–IIIA as per the 7th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer) who were aged 18 years or older with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to either neoadjuvant durvalumab monotherapy or neoadjuvant durvalumab plus stereotactic body radiotherapy (8 Gy × 3 fractions), using permuted blocks with varied sizes and no stratification for clinical or molecular variables. Patients, treating physicians, and all study personnel were unmasked to treatment assignment after all patients were randomly assigned. All patients received two cycles of durvalumab 3 weeks apart at a dose of 1·12 g by intravenous infusion over 60 min. Those in the durvalumab plus radiotherapy group also received three consecutive daily fractions of 8 Gy stereotactic body radiotherapy delivered to the primary tumour immediately before the first cycle of durvalumab. Patients without systemic disease progression proceeded to surgical resection. The primary endpoint was major pathological response in the primary tumour. All analyses were done on an intention‐to‐treat basis. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrial.gov, NCT02904954, and is ongoing but closed to accrual. Findings: Between Jan 25, 2017, and Sept 15, 2020, 96 patients were screened and 60 were enrolled and randomly assigned to either the durvalumab monotherapy group (n=30) or the durvalumab plus radiotherapy group (n=30). 26 (87%) of 30 patients in each group had their tumours surgically resected. Major pathological response was observed in two (6·7% [95% CI 0·8–22·1]) of 30 patients in the durvalumab monotherapy group and 16 (53·3% [34·3–71·7]) of 30 patients in the durvalumab plus radiotherapy group. The difference in the major pathological response rates between both groups was significant (crude odds ratio 16·0 [95% CI 3·2–79·6]; p<0·0001). In the 16 patients in the dual therapy group with a major pathological response, eight (50%) had a complete pathological response. The second cycle of durvalumab was withheld in three (10%) of 30 patients in the dual therapy group due to immune‐related adverse events (grade 3 hepatitis, grade 2 pancreatitis, and grade 3 fatigue and thrombocytopaenia). Grade 3–4 adverse events occurred in five (17%) of 30 patients in the durvalumab monotherapy group and six (20%) of 30 patients in the durvalumab plus radiotherapy group. The most frequent grade 3–4 events were hyponatraemia (three [10%] patients in the durvalumab monotherapy group) and hyperlipasaemia (three [10%] patients in the durvalumab plus radiotherapy group). Two patients in each group had serious adverse events (pulmonary embolism [n=1] and stroke [n=1] in the durvalumab monotherapy group, and pancreatitis [n=1] and fatigue [n=1] in the durvalumab plus radiotherapy group). No treatment‐related deaths or deaths within 30 days of surgery were reported. Interpretation: Neoadjuvant durvalumab combined with stereotactic body radiotherapy is well tolerated, safe, and associated with a high major pathological response rate. This neoadjuvant strategy should be validated in a larger trial. Funding: AstraZeneca.},

Trials I to III were randomized phase III studies testing the value of prophylactic cranial irradiation, immunotherapy, and etoposide, respectively. They were done in the setting of combined modality treatment with the same local chest radiotherapy (3,000 rad in 10 fractions) and combined agent chemotherapy using a nucleus of CAV (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine). Trial IV was a pilot study evaluating sequential hemibody radiotherapy in a combined modality treatment program with CAV. Overall, the best treatment results to date have been observed following the combination of etoposide with CAV in trial III, particularly for patients with extensive disease. This combination with or without other agents also appears to be a common component of many trials that have reported particularly good survival results in this disease.},

abstract = {Purpose/Objective(s): Chemo‐immunotherapy became the standard of care in the first‐line treatment of ES‐SCLC after the IMpower133 trial demonstrated an improvement in overall survival with carboplatin/etoposide (CP/ET) + atezolizumab (atezo). This exploratory analysis seeks to examine patterns of first progression after CP/ET + atezo in IMpower133 (NCT02763579). Materials/Methods: 403 patients with ECOG PS 0‐1 and no prior systemic therapy for ES‐SCLC were randomly assigned (1:1) to 4 cycles of CP and ET with either atezo or placebo, followed by maintenance atezo or placebo until disease progression (per RECIST 1.1), loss of clinical benefit or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with treated asymptomatic brain metastases were allowed. Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) was allowed at the discretion of the treating physician. Consolidative thoracic radiation was not permitted. Patients were stratified by sex, ECOG PS (0 or 1) and presence of brain metastases (yes or no). Progression of disease was investigator assessed (per RECIST 1.1). Patterns of progression were summarized descriptively. Time to progression was estimated by Kaplan‐Meier methodology, and comparisons between treatment arms were made with an unstratified log‐rank test. Results: The number of patients receiving PCI in the intent‐to‐treat (ITT) population was comparable in both arms (11%). In the ITT population, time to intra‐cranial progression, defined as first development of new lesions in the brain or receipt of brain radiation without new brain lesions reported during the follow‐up period, was improved in patients receiving atezo, with a median of 20.2 vs 10.5 mo (HR, 0.66; 95% CI: 0.44, 1.00). In patients who did not receive PCI (placebo, n = 180; atezo, n = 179), a similar trend was seen, with a median time to intra‐cranial progression of 16.7 mo in the atezo arm vs 9.8 mo in the placebo arm (HR, 0.72; 95% CI: 0.47, 1.09). 59.4% of patients in the placebo arm progressed in initial target lesions compared with 56.2% of patients in the atezo arm. Progression outside of initial sites of disease developed in 53.0% vs 48.3% of patients in the placebo vs atezo arm, respectively. In the ITT population, the most common sites of progression in patients who progressed in new sites were the brain (13.4% vs 12.4% [placebo vs atezo]), lymph nodes (12.4% for both arms), lung (11.9% vs 11.4%) and liver (10.4% vs 10.0%). Conclusion: CP/ET + atezo delayed the time to intra‐cranial progression, indicating potential CNS efficacy in a disease in which brain metastases are pervasive. In both treatment arms, the most dominant pattern of progression was in initial sites of disease. This suggests a role for consolidative radiation to initial thoracic disease and sites of metastases to further improve outcomes in patients with ES‐SCLC receiving chemo‐immunotherapy; this is being evaluated in the NRG Oncology LU007 study (NCT04402788).},

However, little is known about the prognostic role of immune response markers in this setting. We analysed PD‐L1 expression and tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TiLs) in tumour biopsies from the multicenter German Intergroup Lung Trial (GILT), which previously randomised patients with stage III NSCLC to RTCT with or without consolidation chemotherapy. Materials and methods: We retrospectively analyzed tumour biopsies from patients treated in the GILT trial. PD‐L1 expression was analysed using the Ventana SP263 assay and TiL score (low, intermediate, high) and pattern (excluded, inflamed, desert) were assessed. The primary endpoint of the biomarker analysis was PFS in patients with PD‐L1 ≥ 1% vs. PD‐L1 < 1% NSCLC. Secondary endpoints explored the prognostic relevance of additional PD‐L1 expression levels and TiL score and pattern. Results: Biopsies were available from 92 patients treated with RTCT. Patients with available tumor tissue did not differ significantly from the whole study population. PD‐L1 scores from 78 samples were available for analysis. There was no difference in PFS in the PD‐L1 < 1% vs. PD‐L1 ≥ 1% subgroups. TiL score was available in 66 patients. Patients with high TiL score showed favourable overall survival compared to the low TiL subgroup. This trend was most pronounced in those patients treated with consolidative chemotherapy. Conclusion: In this analysis, PD‐L1 expression did not correlate with PFS following RTCT. However, patients with TiLs > 10% were found to have longer overall survival, especially for those patients treated with consolidation chemotherapy after the end of RTCT. Further analyses to explore the prognostic and predictive relevance of TiLs in the context of consolidative checkpoint inhibition with durvalumab are required.},

abstract = {Background: Immune checkpoint inhibition is now given in combination with chemotherapy for first line (1L) therapy of extensive stage small cell lung cancer (ES‐SCLC). We conducted a randomized phase II study of nivolumab (anti‐PD1) in combination with platinum‐etoposide (CE) as 1L treatment for patients with ES‐SCLC (EA5161, NCT03382561). Methods: Patients with measurable (RECIST v1.1) ES‐SCLC, ECOG performance status 0 or 1, who had not received prior systemic treatment for ES‐SCLC were enrolled. Patients were randomized 1:1 to nivolumab 360 mg + CE every 21 days for 4 cycles followed by maintenance nivolumab 240 mg every 2 weeks until progression or up to 2 years (arm A) or CE every 21 days for 4 cycles followed by observation (arm B). Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) was permitted at the investigator's discretion. Investigator's choice of cisplatin or carboplatin was allowed across both arms. The primary endpoint was PFS in eligible and treated patients. Secondary endpoints included OS, ORR, and safety. Adverse events (AEs) were graded per NCI‐CTCAE v4.0. Results: This study was activated in May 2018 and completed accrual in December 2018. 160 patients were enrolled. Baseline characteristics were well balanced between arms. In the ITT population (n = 160), nivolumab + CE significantly improved the PFS compared to CE with HR 0.65 (95% CI, 0.46, 0.91; p = 0.012); mPFS 5.5 versus 4.6 months, respectively. Secondary endpoint of OS was also improved with nivolumab + CE versus CE with HR 0.67 (95% CI, 0.46, 0.98; p = 0.038); mOS 11.3 versus 8.5 months. Among patients who initiated study therapy, nivolumab + CE significantly improved the PFS compared to CE with HR 0.68 (95% CI, 0.48, 1.00; p = 0.047); mPFS 5.5 versus 4.7 months, respectively; in this population, OS was also improved with nivolumab + CE versus CE with HR 0.73 (95% CI, 0.49, 1.11; p = 0.14); mOS 11.3 versus 9.3 months. The ORR was 52.29% versus 47.71%. The incidence of treatment‐related grade 3/4 AEs was 77% versus 62% and AEs leading to discontinuation 6.21% versus 2.07%. Ten patients remain on maintenance nivolumab. Lethal adverse events independent of treatment were similar between the two arms (9 in arm A; 7 in arm B). Conclusions: The addition of nivolumab to CE as 1L treatment for ES‐SCLC significantly improved PFS and OS. No new safety signals were observed.},

abstract = {Concurrent chemotherapy and thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) have been standard treatment for limited stage (LS) small‐cell lung cancer (SCLC) since the 1990's, but the optimal dose and schedule of TRT is debated. The Intergroup 0096 trial published in 1999 established twice‐daily (BID) TRT of 45 Gy in 30 fractions as the best documented schedule.1 However, BID TRT caused more esophageal toxicity than once daily (QD) TRT, and it has been argued that the biologically effective dose (BED) in the control arm (45 Gy in 25 fractions) was inferior, and population based studies show that BID TRT is poorly implemented.2,3 Results from single arm studies suggest that high dose QD TRT might be an alternative to 45 Gy BID, and such schedules are widely used. However, the first randomized trial comparing high dose QD with BID TRT failed to show that 66 Gy in 33 fractions was superior to 45 Gy BID, and numerically, survival was better in the 45 Gy BID arm.4 At this year's ASCO Annual meeting (2021), the first survival data from the long awaited CALGB 20610/RTOG 0538 trial were presented. Patients were randomized to 45 Gy BID, 70 Gy in 35 fractions (QD) or 61.2 Gy in 34 fractions (QD in 16 days followed by BID in 9 days). After a preplanned interim toxicity analysis, the 61.2 Gy arm was dropped in March 2012. The trial was designed to show superiority of the higher TRT‐dose. Survival data in the 45 Gy BID and 70 Gy QD arms were similar, and the trial was per definition negative, but 70 Gy QD appears to be an alternative to 45 Gy BID. Notably, there was no difference in radiotoxicity between treatment arms.5 A systematic review concluded that a shorter time from start of chemotherapy until end of TRT is associated with improved survival.6 Consequently, it seems reasonable that high dose TRT might improve survival if it is accelerated, i.e. the treatment period is reduced, and two trials published this year have investigated such TRT schedules. A Chinese study randomized patients to receive moderately hypofractionated TRT of 65 Gy in 26 fractions or 45 Gy BID and showed that the hypofractionated schedule prolonged PFS (median PFS 17.2 vs. 13.4 months; p=0.031). There was, however, no statistically significant survival benefit (median OS 39.3 vs. 33.6 months; p=0.14), though the survival data are not yet mature.7 A Nordic trial employed a different strategy. In this trial, patients were randomized to receive standard BID TRT of 45 Gy in 30 fractions or high‐dose TRT of 60 Gy in 40 fractions. There was a large improvement for the primary endpoint, 2‐year survival (74% vs. 48%; p=0.0005), and in median overall survival (37.2 vs. 22.6 months; p=0.012), though the difference in median PFS was not statistically significant (18.6 vs. 10.9 months; p=0.13). Final survival data will be presented in 2023.8 There are differences in patient selection, definitions of limited stage disease, target volume definitions and radiotherapy techniques between these trials (and the Intergroup 0096), and they are not necessarily directly comparable. However, it appears that with improvement in assessing extent of disease, using modern radiotherapy techniques and omitting elective nodal irradiation, there is now far less radiotoxicity from 45 Gy BID than observed in the Intergroup 0096. Furthermore, the high dose TRT schedules mentioned here are not more toxic than 45 Gy BID. It has been commented that a non‐inferiority trial is needed to establish high‐dose QD TRT as an alternative to 45 Gy BID, but one might question whether this is a priority. Not many randomized LS SCLC trials have been completed the last 20 years (e.g. the CALGB/RTOG trial took 11 years to complete), and it seems more appropriate to further investigate the accelerated schedules which seem to hold a larger potential for improved survival. However, it might be a good idea to await final survival data from the Chinese and Nordic trials. Another factor to consider before designing the next TRT trial is the potential role of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in the treatment of LS SCLC. Two trials have shown a survival improvement of adding atezolizumab or durvalumab to chemotherapy in extensive stage SCLC,9,10 and several ongoing trials are investigating whether concurrent or consolidation ICI therapy improves survival also in LS SCLC. 1.

abstract = {Advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains a high unmet medical need. The first line standard‐of‐care therapy comprises concurrent chemotherapy‐immunotherapy with pembrolizumab. Concurrent irradiation with pembrolizumab has been shown to significantly improve survival benefit compared with immunotherapy alone in a pooled analysis of 2 randomized phase 2 trials. We present the rationale and study design of the “PD‐1 iNhibitor and chemotherapy with concurrent IRradiation at VAried tumor sites in advanced Non‐small cell lung cAncer” (NIRVANA‐Lung) trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT03774732). This study is a national multicenter 1:1 randomized phase III trial testing in 460 patients, the addition of multisite radiotherapy in advanced NSCLC treated with standard immune checkpoint inhibitors (pembrolizumab)‐chemotherapy in first line. The primary objective of the trial is to compare the overall survival between the 2 arms at year 1 of the study. The secondary objective is to compare the progression‐free survival and cancer‐specific survival at year 1 and 2, as well as to determine quality of life, local and distant control in irradiated and nonirradiated sites at 6 months and year 1.},

abstract = {Standard of care for non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (surgery, chemotherapy and radiation) may enhance patient survival but the enhancement is typically transient and quite uncommon with advanced disease. Researchers and medical professionals are using new approaches to improve patient mortality and morbidity. One of these approaches, immunotherapy, seeks to stimulate antitumour immunity above a threshold level needed for tumour regression or to induce stability in the face of progression. Among the most established approaches are vaccines involving monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) or immune effector cells. These approaches stimulate the humoral and cell‐mediated arms of the immune system, respectively. As the development of humanised or fully human antibodies has spurred exploration of radioimmunoconjugates and immunotoxins, mAbs have enjoyed a revival of sorts. Cell‐based therapies using the tumour cell itself as a vaccine component has resulted in disease stabilisation or regression. In addition, immune cells (e.g., T‐lymphocytes and dendritic cells [DCs]) are the focal point of numerous patient trials in which meaningful clinical impact was achieved. In general, there are many tactics under development for the treatment of NSCLC. This review primarily concerns immunotherapeutic cancer treatments that are either already in clinical trial or well progressed into preclinical studies.},

abstract = {Purpose/Objective(s): Consolidative thoracic radiotherapy (cTRT) showed potential benefit to extensive stage small cell lung cancer (ES‐SCLC). However, the optimum dose of cTRT is unknown. The purpose of this randomized trial was to compare the effect of 45 Gy in 15 fractions with 30 Gy in 10 fractions cTRT in ES‐SCLC. Materials/Methods: This phase III, randomized trial was conducted in 12 public hospitals in China. Eligible patients with pathologically confirmed ES‐SCLC who responded to 4‐6 cycles of etoposide plus cisplatin (EP) or carboplatin (EC) chemotherapy were randomized 1:1 to receive either 30 Gy in 10 fractions or 45 Gy in 15 fractions cTRT. The primary outcome was 2‐year overall survival (OS). Secondary outcomes included 2‐year progression‐free survival (PFS), 2‐year local control (LC) and radiation treatment related toxicity. The primary objective was to detect an OS improvement in 45 Gy cTRT group at 2 years from 13% to 26% assuming a two‐sided a = 0.05 and power of 85%, with a planned sample size of 186 patients. This trial was registered with Clinical Trials.gov, number NCT02675088. Results: Between January 15, 2016, and September 20, 2022, 90 patients were randomly assigned either 30 Gy in 10 fractions (n = 50) or 45 Gy in 15 fractions (n = 40) cTRT group. Recruitment to the trial closed early due to slow accrual since first‐line chemoimmunotherapy has become the new standard of care for ES‐SCLC. The median age of patients was 58 years, 87.8% were male, 76.7% had a smoking history, 95.6% received IMRT, and 58.9% received prophylactic cranial irradiation. At a median follow‐up of 39.9 months (IQR 27.2‐59.2), there was no significant difference in the 2‐year OS between the 45 Gy group and the 30 Gy group, at 43.4% (95% CI 29.3%–64.3%) and 40.0% (95% CI 27.9%‐59.1%), respectively (log‐rank p = 0.62; HR 1.13 [95% CI 0.69–1.84]). The 2‐year PFS was 12.1% (95% CI 4.3%–33.8%) in the 45 Gy group and 9.0% (95% CI 3.2%–25.2%) in the 30 Gy group (log‐rank p = 0.25, HR 0.76(95% CI [0.478‐1.22]). There were also no significant differences in locoregional recurrence free survival (log‐rank p = 0.75; HR 0.888 [95% CI 0.423–1.863]) and distant metastasis free survival (log‐rank p = 0.95; HR 1.015 [95% CI 0.624–1.651]) between two groups. No grade 5 toxicity was observed in both groups. Patients treated with higher cTRT dose presented with increased incidence of grade 3+ radiation pneumonitis (10% vs 2%) and hematological toxicity (20% vs 12.5%). Conclusion: This randomized trial did not find a higher probability of survival improvement in patients with ES‐SCLC receiving cTRT of 45 Gy in 15 fractions compared with 30 Gy in 10 fractions. In contrast, there was an increase in toxicity, especially radiation pneumonitis. Additional randomized studies investigating the role of cTRT in ES‐SCLC after a response to chemoimmunotherapy are warranted.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The immunological and clinical responses of patients with NSCLC treated, in the context of an expanded action program, with the cryptic hTERT‐targeting Vx‐001 vaccine are presented. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty‐six HLA‐A*0201‐positive patients with advanced NSCLC and residual (n=27) or progressive (n=19) disease following front‐line treatment received two subcutaneous injections of the optimized TERT572Y peptide followed by four injections of the native TERT572 peptide, every 3 weeks. Peptide‐specific immune responses were monitored by enzyme‐linked immunosorbent spot assay at baseline, and after the 2nd and the 6th vaccinations. Thirty‐eight HLA‐A*0201‐positive matched patients were used as historical controls. RESULTS: Twenty‐three patients (50%) completed the vaccination protocol and 87% received at least two administrations. Twelve patients (26%) without disease progression after the 6th vaccination received boost vaccinations. Three (7%) patients achieved a partial response and 13 (28%) disease stabilization. The disease control rate was significantly higher in patients with non‐squamous histology compared to those with squamous‐cell histology [n=14 (45%) versus n=2 (13%); p=0.03]. The median progression‐free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) was 3.8 (range, 0.7‐99.4) and 19.8 months (range, 0.7‐99.4), respectively. Patients who developed immune response had a numerically higher PFS compared to those who failed to mount any (6.7 versus 2.7 months; p=0.090). However, the median OS for the immune‐responders was significantly prolonged compared to non‐responders (40.0 versus 9.2 months, respectively; p=0.02). Toxicity was <grade 2. CONCLUSION: Vx‐001 vaccine is well tolerated and induced a TERT‐specific immunological response, which was significantly correlated with improved clinical outcome.},

In December 2020, we initiated a randomized controlled trial in Japan to confirm whether the weekly carboplatin plus nab‐paclitaxel regimen is noninferior to the daily low‐dose carboplatin regimen for concurrent chemoradiotherapy in elderly patients with unresectable c‐Stage III NSCLC. We plan to enroll 166 patients from 50 institutions in 3.5 years. The primary endpoint is overall survival. The secondary endpoints are progression‐free survival, response rate, proportion of patients starting maintenance durvalumab therapy, adverse events, site of progression, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy‐Trial Outcome Index deterioration and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living deterioration.},

abstract = {Purpose: Immune checkpoint blockade targeting the PD‐1/PD‐L1 pathway in combination with platinum‐based chemotherapy (CT) has demonstrated improved clinical outcomes in patients (pts) with extensive‐stage small‐cell lung cancer (ES‐SCLC). Treatment with durvalumab (D), a selective, high‐affinity, human IgG1 mAb that blocks PD‐L1 binding to PD‐1 and CD80, and tremelimumab (T), a selective human IgG2 mAb against CTLA‐4, may provide possible additive or synergistic effects. Durvalumab demonstrated durable clinical activity and had a manageable safety profile both as monotherapy and in combination with tremelimumab in pts with pretreated ES‐SCLC (NCT01693562; NCT02261220; NCT02937818). CASPIAN (NCT03043872) is a randomised, multicentre, open‐label, sponsor‐blind, Phase 3 study of Durvalumab ± Tremelimumab in combination with etoposide and platinum‐based CT (EP) as first‐line treatment for pts with ES‐SCLC. Methods: In total, 804 pts were randomised 1:1:1 to receive D 1500 mg + T 75 mg + EP q3w for 4 cycles, followed by D 1500 mg q4w until disease progression (PD), with one additional dose of T given post EP (Arm 1); D 1500 mg + EP q3w for 4 cycles, followed by D 1500 mg q4w until PD (Arm 2); or EP q3w for 4‐6 cycles with prophylactic cranial irradiation if indicated (Arm 3). Randomisation was stratified by platinum‐based CT in cycle 1 (carboplatin vs cisplatin). Pts had histologically or cytologically documented ES‐SCLC, WHO/ECOG PS 0 or 1 and were suitable to receive first‐line platinum‐based CT. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS) for D ± T + EP versus EP. Secondary endpoints included progression‐free survival (PFS); objective response rate; landmark OS and PFS rates; safety and tolerability; pharmacokinetics; immunogenicity; quality of life. Results: Results will be presented at WCLC 2019 including OS, key secondary endpoints, safety and tolerability. Conclusions: Not applicable.},

abstract = {Introduction: The 5 year survival rate for patients with locally advanced non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC) not amenable for definitive resection with historical standard‐of‐care concurrent chemoradiotherapy (cCRT) ranges from 15% to 32%. cCRT primes anti‐tumor immunity and also upregulates programmed death ligand‐1 (PD‐L1), providing a rationale for combining an immune checkpoint inhibitor with cCRT to improve outcomes. In the PACIFIC trial, consolidation therapy with the PD‐L1 inhibitor durvalumab improved progression‐free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) vs. placebo in patients with stage III NSCLC who did not have disease progression after cCRT. CheckMate73L (NCT04026412), a randomized phase 3 study, evaluates the efficacy of nivolumab plus cCRT followed by nivolumab with or without ipilimumab vs. cCRT followed by durvalumab for untreated, stage III NSCLC. Patients and Methods: Patients with untreated, stage III NSCLC will be randomized 1:1:1 to nivolumab plus cCRT followed by nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab (Arm A) or nivolumab alone (Arm B); or cCRT followed by durvalumab (Arm C). Primary endpoints are PFS and OS (Arm A vs. Arm C). Secondary endpoints include additional analyses of PFS and OS (Arm A vs. Arm B; Arm B vs. Arm C), as well as objective response rate, complete response rate, time to response, duration of response, time to death or distant metastases, and safety and tolerability.

abstract = {The treatment paradigm of non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has rapidly changed in recent years following the introduction of immune‐checkpoint inhibition (ICI). Pre‐clinically, both chemotherapy and radiotherapy modulate the tumour microenvironment, providing the rationale for clinical trials evaluating their role in combination with immunotherapy. Standard‐of‐care treatment for patients with unresectable stage III disease is concurrent chemoradiotherapy (cCRT); however, only recently, the combination with ICI has been explored. The Phase 3 PACIFIC study randomised 713 patients with confirmed locally advanced, unresectable, stage III NSCLC, whose disease has not progressed following cCRT, to either the anti‐programmed death‐ligand 1 (PD‐L1) agent durvalumab (Imfinzi®▼, AstraZeneca UK Limited) or placebo. Patients with a PD‐L1 status ≥1% treated with durvalumab had a significantly longer median progression‐free survival compared with placebo (17.2 vs. 5.6 months, respectively; HR: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.41–0.63), prolonged median overall survival (OS) (NR vs. 28.7 months, respectively; HR: 0.68; 99.73% CI: 0.47–0.997; P = 0.0025) and long‐term clinical benefit (3‐year OS HR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.55–0.86). Grade 3 or 4 toxicity was marginally greater in the durvalumab cohort versus placebo (30.5% vs. 26.1%). Based on these results, durvalumab has been licensed in this setting, and further clinical trials are exploring the use of ICI in unresectable stage III NSCLC.},

abstract = {Background: Niraparib is a highly selective PARP‐1/2 inhibitor approved by FDA for the maintenance therapy of ovarian cancer. It also showed promising activity as maintenance treatment in platinum sensitive SCLC PDX models. ZL‐2306‐005 is a randomized, double‐blind, multicenter phase Ⅲ study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of niraparib (nira) versus placebo (pla) as first line (1L) maintenance therapy in extensive‐stage SCLC (ES‐SCLC) patients. Methods: Patients (pts) with ES‐SCLC, ECOG PS 0 or 1, CR/PR after 4 cycles of 1L etoposide/cisplatin or etoposide/carboplatin were enrolled. Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) was optional. Pts were randomized 2:1 to receive nira or pla once daily as maintenance therapy until progression or unacceptable toxicity. Nira started with 300mg QD for pts with baseline body weight ≥77 kg and platelet count ≥150,000/μL, otherwise 200 mg QD. Stratified factors were gender, LDH level and PCI history. The primary endpoints were PFS by blinded independent central review (BICR) and OS; the secondary endpoints were PFS by investigator, CFI, QoL, safety and tolerability. Results: From Jul 2017 to Feb 2020, 272 pts were screened in 34 sites, of whom 185 were randomized and dosed according to protocol, 125 in nira arm and 60 in pla arm. The study was early terminated due to landscape changed by immunotherapy in ES‐SCLC. At the data cutoff: 20 Mar 2020, there were 167 pts discontinued from the treatment and 70 pts died. Median PFS (BICR) was 1.54 m (1.41, 2.69) in nira arm and 1.36 m (1.31, 1.48) in pla arm (HR 0.66; 95% CI [0.46, 0.95]; p= 0.0242). Median OS was 9.92 m (9.33, 13.54) in nira arm and 11.43 m (9.53, NE) in pla arm (HR 1.03; 95% CI [0.42, 1.73]; p = 0.9052). Grade≥3 treatment‐related AEs (TEAEs) was 34.4% in nira arm vs. 25% in pla arm. No patient had a TEAE leading to death. Conclusions: Niraparib has modest improvement in PFS compared to placebo in 1L ES‐SCLC maintenance with manageable and tolerated safety profile. OS benefit was not observed based on immature data. The value of adding niraparib to immunotherapy needs further investigation. Clinical trial identification: NCT03516084. Legal entity responsible for the study: Zai Lab. Funding: Zai Lab.

abstract = {ECOG‐ACRIN EA5181 is a phase III prospective, randomized trial that randomizes patients undergoing chemo/radiation for locally advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (LA‐NSCLC) to concomitant durvalumab or no additional therapy, with both arms receiving 1 year of consolidative durvalumab. Radiation dose escalation failed to improve overall survival in RTOG 0617. However, conventionally fractionated radiation to 60 Gy with concomitant chemotherapy is associated with a high risk of local failure (38%–46%). It is hoped that concomitant immunotherapy during chemo/radiation can help decrease the risk of local failure, thereby improving overall survival and progression‐free survival with acceptable toxicity. In this article, we review conventional chemo/radiation therapy for LA‐NSCLC, as well as the quickly evolving world of immunotherapy in the treatment of non‐small cell lung cancer and discuss the rationale and study design of EA5181. Implications for Practice: This article provides an up‐to‐date assessment of how immunotherapy is reshaping the landscape of metastatic non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and how the impact of this therapy is now rapidly moving into the treatment of patients with locally advanced NSCLC who are presenting for curative treatment. This article reviews the recent publications of chemo/radiation as well as those combining immunotherapy with chemotherapy and chemo/radiation, and provides a strategy for improving overall survival of patients with locally advanced NSCLC by using concomitant immunotherapy with standard concurrent chemo/radiation.},

Methods: Pts (N =834) with ED‐SCLC, ECOG performance status (PS) ≤ 1 and response or stable disease after 4 cycles of 1L platinum‐based chemo were randomized 1:1:1 (3‐9 weeks from last dose of 1L chemo or 3‐11 weeks for pts who received prophylactic cranial irradiation [PCI]) to nivo 1 mg/kg + ipi 3 mg/kg Q3W intravenously (IV; 4 doses followed by nivo 240 mg Q2W IV; n =279), nivo 240 mg Q2W IV (n = 280), or pbo (n =275), stratified by PS, sex and prior PCI. Pts were treated up to 2 years or until progression or unacceptable toxicity. Primary endpoint was overall survival (OS) for nivo+ipi vs pbo. Secondary endpoints included OS for nivo vs pbo and progression‐free survival (PFS) per blinded independent central review for nivo+ipi vs pbo and nivo vs pbo. Results: Minimum study follow‐up was 9 months. Baseline characteristics were balanced between arms. OS was not significantly prolonged with nivo+ipi vs pbo (HR, 0.92; 95% CI 0.75‐1.12; P= 0.3693). OS was also not prolonged for nivo vs pbo (HR, 0.84; 95% CI 0.69‐1.02), although not formally tested due to statistical hierarchy. PFS HRs vs pbo were: nivo+ipi, 0.72 (0.60‐0.87); nivo, 0.67 (0.56‐0.81). Rates of all‐grade (grade 3‐4) tx‐related adverse events were: nivo+ipi, 86% (52%); nivo, 61% (12%); pbo, 50% (8%). Rates of discontinuation due to tx toxicity were: nivo+ipi, 31%; nivo, 9%; pbo,<1%. Tx‐related deaths were: nivo+ipi, 7 (2.5%); nivo, 1 (<1%); pbo, 1 (<1%). Conclusions: In CheckMate 451, maintenance therapy with nivo+ipi (primary endpoint) or nivo did not prolong OS vs pbo for ED‐SCLC patients who did not progress on 1L chemo. Safety profiles of nivo+ipi and nivo were consistent with previous reports at this dose/schedule in SCLC.},

Since Takada et al. showed superiority of concomitant RCTx, this is seen as standard of care (SoC). 2 trials recently have shown an overall survival (OS) benefit for adding PD‐L1 antibodies to CTx in pts with extensive disease SCLC. For limited disease patients concomitant RCTx and Durvalumab followed by Durvalumab maintenance may therefore show better results for progression free survival (PFS). Methods/Trial design: This clinical trial is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, open‐label, parallel group phase II investigator initiated trial (IIT) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Durvalumab in combination with Cisplatin/Etoposide/Radiotherapy followed by maintenance Durvalumab in patients with LD‐SCLC. Prophylactic cranial irradiation is possible in both groups.

All pts receive 4‐6 cycles of CTx and RTx of 60±6 Gy, 2 Gy/d), Durvalumab maintenance continues until progressive disease. The primary endpoint is PFS after 18 months. Secondary endpoints include overall response rate, disease control rate, OS, PFS at other assessments, patient reported quality of life and safety and tolerability. The trial began in December 2020 and recruitment is ongoing and planned at seven sites in Germany; an estimated 105 pts will be enrolled. Duration of the trial is estimated 30 months. Assessment of biomarker analysis of tumor biopsies will be performed for all patients by central lab by next generation sequencing (NGS).},

abstract = {Introduction: In the Phase 3, randomised, open‐label CASPIAN study, first‐line durvalumab plus etoposide and cisplatin or carboplatin (EP) significantly improved overall survival (OS) compared with EP alone in patients with extensive‐stage small‐cell lung cancer (ES‐SCLC) at the planned interim analysis (data cut‐off: 11 March 2019): hazard ratio (HR) 0.73 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.59–0.91; p=0.0047). This OS benefit was sustained after a median follow‐up of more than 2 years (data cut‐off 27 Jan 2020): HR 0.75 (95% CI 0.62‒0.91; nominal p=0.0032). Here we present post‐hoc exploratory analyses at the updated data cut‐off based on the extent of disease at baseline. Methods: Treatment‐naïve patients (WHO performance status 0/1) with ES‐SCLC received 4 cycles of durvalumab 1500 mg + EP q3w followed by maintenance durvalumab 1500 mg q4w until disease progression (PD) or up to 6 cycles of EP q3w and optional prophylactic cranial irradiation (investigator’s discretion). Planned consolidation thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) was not permitted. The primary endpoint was OS. Progression‐free survival (PFS) was a secondary endpoint. Patients with M0 or M1a classification at diagnosis were included in the thoracic‐only disease subgroup and M1b in the extra‐thoracic disease subgroup. Data cut‐off: 27 Jan 2020. Results: At baseline, 151 (28.1%) of 537 patients had thoracic‐only disease, of whom 77 (28.7%) were in the durvalumab + EP arm and 74 (27.5%) were in the EP arm. Among 386 (71.9%) patients with any extra‐thoracic disease at baseline, 191 (71.3%) were in the durvalumab + EP arm and 195 (72.5%) were in the EP arm; across both arms, the most common sites of extra‐thoracic disease were liver (52.8%), adrenal gland (35.8%), bone (31.3%) and brain (13.7%). Durvalumab + EP improved OS vs EP regardless of the extent of disease (thoracic‐only HR 0.73 [95% CI 0.51–1.06]; extra‐thoracic HR 0.77 [0.62–0.96]); PFS was also improved with durvalumab + EP vs EP in these subgroups (HR 0.70 [95% CI 0.49–1.00] and 0.85 [0.68–1.05], respectively). Among patients with extra‐thoracic disease, 52.8% in the EP arm developed new lesions at first PD vs 44.5% in the durvalumab + EP arm (EP vs durvalumab + EP: lung 14.4% vs 8.9%; liver 11.8% vs 6.8%; bone 8.7% vs 4.7%). In the thoracic‐only disease subgroup, a similar proportion of patients had new lesions at first PD in the EP (36.5%) and durvalumab + EP (36.4%) arms, however more patients developed new lesions in the lung in the EP arm compared with the durvalumab + EP arm (20.3% vs 7.8%). TRT was administered concurrently with study treatment in 1.1% of all patients across both arms. TRT was administered subsequent to study treatment in a higher proportion of patients in the EP arm compared with the durvalumab + EP arm, regardless of whether patients had thoracic‐only disease (31.1% vs 7.8%) or extra‐thoracic disease (12.3% vs 7.3%). Conclusion: In CASPIAN, OS and PFS were improved with durvalumab + EP vs EP, regardless of the presence or absence of extra‐thoracic disease, consistent with the intention‐to‐treat analyses.

abstract = {Importance: Although immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting programmed cell death 1 (PD‐1) and PD‐1 ligand 1 have improved the outcome for many cancer types, the majority of patients fails to respond to ICI monotherapy. Hypofractionated radiotherapy has the potential to improve the therapeutic ratio of ICIs. Objective: To assess the addition of radiotherapy to ICIs compared with ICI monotherapy in patients with advanced solid tumors. Design, Setting, and Participants: This open‐label, multicenter, randomized phase 2 trial was conducted in 5 Belgian hospitals and enrolled participants between March 2018 and October 2020. Patients 18 years or older with locally advanced or metastatic melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, urothelial carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, or non‐small cell lung carcinoma were eligible. A total of 99 patients were randomly assigned to either the control arm (n = 52) or the experimental arm (n = 47). Of those, 3 patients (1 in the control arm vs 2 in the experimental arm) withdrew consent and thus were not included in the analysis. Data analyses were performed between April 2022 and March 2023. Interventions: Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive anti‐PD‐1/PD‐1 ligand 1 ICIs alone as per standard of care (control arm) or combined with stereotactic body radiotherapy 3 × 8 gray to a maximum of 3 lesions prior to the second or third ICI cycle, depending on the frequency of administration (experimental arm). Randomization was stratified according to tumor histologic findings and disease burden (3 and fewer or more than 3 cancer lesions). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was progression‐free survival (PFS) as per immune Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. Key secondary end points included overall survival (OS), objective response rate, local control rate, and toxic effects. Efficacy was assessed in the intention‐to‐treat population, while safety was evaluated in the as‐treated population. Results: Among 96 patients included in the analysis (mean age, 66 years; 76 [79%] female), 72 (75%) had more than 3 tumor lesions and 65 (68%) had received at least 1 previous line of systemic treatment at time of inclusion. Seven patients allocated to the experimental arm did not complete the study‐prescribed radiotherapy course due to early disease progression (n = 5) or intercurrent illness (n = 2). With a median (range) follow‐up of 12.5 (0.7‐46.2) months, median PFS was 2.8 months in the control arm compared with 4.4 months in the experimental arm (hazard ratio, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.58‐1.53; P = .82). Between the control and experimental arms, no improvement in median OS was observed (11.0 vs 14.3 months; hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.48‐1.41; P = .47), and objective response rate was not statistically significantly different (22% vs 27%; P = .56), despite a local control rate of 75% in irradiated patients. Acute treatment‐related toxic effects of any grade and grade 3 or higher occurred in 79% and 18% of patients in the control arm vs 78% and 18% in the experimental arm, respectively. No grade 5 adverse events occurred. Conclusions and Relevance: This phase 2 randomized clinical trial demonstrated that while safe, adding subablative stereotactic radiotherapy of a limited number of metastatic lesions to ICI monotherapy failed to show improvement in PFS or OS.

abstract = {Background: Therapeutic options for SCLC remain limited, with EP as the standard first‐line chemotherapy regimen. However, patients (pts) with ES‐SCLC experience high relapse rates within months after initial therapy. Pembrolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against PD‐1, has shown antitumor activity as monotherapy in heavily pretreated pts with PD‐L1‐positive SCLC in the phase 1b KEYNOTE‐028 study. KEYNOTE‐604 (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03066778) evaluates EP plus either pembrolizumab or placebo (pbo) as first‐line therapy for ES‐SCLC. Trial design: In this international, double‐blind, phase 3 trial, adults with newly diagnosed ES‐SCLC, ECOG PS≤1, and no previous systemic therapy for SCLC are randomized 1:1 to receive either EP plus a 200‐mg fixed dose of pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) once every 3 weeks (Q3W) or EP plus pbo IV Q3W. Randomization is stratified by the chosen platinum therapy (carboplatin vs cisplatin), ECOG PS (0 vs 1), and baseline lactate dehydrogenase concentration (≤ upper limit of normal [ULN] vs > ULN). Study treatment includes a total of 4 cycles of EP and 2 y of pembrolizumab/ pbo and continues until documented PD, intolerable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. Pts with a response after 4 cycles of EP plus pbo or pembrolizumab may receive prophylactic cranial irradiation. Pts who complete 2 y of pembrolizumab treatment or stop pembrolizumab for reasons other than PD/intolerability, but subsequently have documented PD, may receive an additional 1 y of pembrolizumab. Tumor response is assessed every 6 wk for 48 wk, and every 9 wk thereafter by RECIST version 1.1 by blinded independent central review. AEs occurring during treatment and 30 d thereafter (90 d for serious AEs) are graded per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. Primary endpoints are PFS and OS. Secondary endpoints are ORR, duration of response, safety, and patient‐reported outcomes. Enrollment is ongoing with a planned enrollment of approximately 430 pts.},

abstract = {Background: Extensive Stage Small cell Lung Cancer (ES‐SCLC) is an aggressive disease with poor outcomes. Although most patients (pts) initially respond to first‐line (1L) treatment, eventually all will relapse. Second‐line (2L) therapeutic options have limited efficacy. For pts with platinum‐free interval (PFI) ≥90 days, rechallenge with carboplatin‐etoposide (CE) is a standard option. A phase 3, randomized trial comparing rechallenge CE vs topotecan in pts with PFI ≥90 days, demonstrated longer progression‐free survival (PFS) in the rechallenge group (4.7 m vs 2.7 m; HR=0.57; p=.0041) but similar (7.5 v 7.4 m) overall survival (OS). However, this study pre‐dates the use of 1st line chemo‐immunotherapy (CT‐IO) therefore the efficacy of platinum rechallenge after CT‐IO is still unclear. Real‐world data could offer valuable insights for this strategy. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed pts with ES‐SCLC who received second‐line rechallenge CE after first‐line CT‐IO between September 2020 and August 2023 in 9 European centres. Demographic and clinical data were collected and analysed. Results: A total of 93 pts were included. Sixty‐six pts (71%) had PFI between 3 and 6 m. Clinical and demographic characteristics stratified by PFI are shown in the table. Consolidation thoracic radiotherapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation had been administered in 31 pts (33.3%) and 20 pts (21.5%), respectively. ORR was 59.1%. Median PFS was 5 m (95% CI, 4.3 – 5.7) and median OS was 7 m (95% CI, 5.7 – 8.3). Notably, PFS and OS were not different according to PFI (3‐6 m v > 6 m). [Formula presented] Conclusions: Rechallenge with CE is a valid 2L option in pts diagnosed with ES‐SCLC who progress after 1L CT‐IO. Our analysis shows similar results compared to previous studies. Furthermore, outcomes were consistent across pts with different PFIs, confirming its efficacy in pts with PFI > 3 months. Legal entity responsible for the study: The authors.

abstract = {Background: Penpulimab is a novel programmed death (PD)‐1 inhibitor. This study aimed to establish the efficacy and safety of first line penpulimab plus chemotherapy for advanced squamous non‐small‐cell lung cancer. Methods: This multicentre, randomised, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, phase 3 clinical trial enrolled patients with locally advanced or metastatic squamous non‐small‐cell lung cancer from 74 hospitals in China. Eligible participants were aged 18–75 years, had histologically or cytologically confirmed locally advanced (stage IIIb or IIIc) or metastatic (stage IV) squamous non‐small‐cell lung cancer, were ineligible to complete surgical resection and concurrent or sequential chemoradiotherapy, had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0–1, did not have previous systemic chemotherapy for locally advanced or metastatic non‐small‐cell lung cancer, and had one or more measurable lesions according to RECIST (version 1.1). Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive intravenous penpulimab 200 mg or placebo (excipient of penpulimab injection), plus paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 and carboplatin AUC of 5 intravenously on day 1 every 3 weeks for four cycles, followed by penpulimab or placebo as maintenance therapy. Stratification was done according to the PD‐L1 tumour proportion score (<1% vs 1–49% vs ≥50%) and sex (male vs female). The participants, investigators, and other research staff were masked to group assignment. The primary outcome was progression‐free survival assessed by the masked Independent Radiology Review Committee in the intention‐to‐treat population and patients with a PD‐L1 tumour proportion score of 1% or more (PD‐L1‐positive subgroup). The primary analysis was based on the intention‐to‐treat analysis set (ie, all randomly assigned participants) and the PD‐L1‐positive subgroup. The safety analysis included all participants who received at least one dose of study drug after enrolment. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03866993). Findings: Between Dec 20, 2018, and Oct 10, 2020, 485 patients were screened, and 350 participants were randomly assigned (175 in the penpulimab group and 175 in the placebo group). Of 350 participants, 324 (93%) were male and 26 (7%) were female, and 347 (99%) were of Han ethnicity. In the final analysis (June 1, 2022; median follow‐up, 24·7 months [IQR 0–41·4]), the penpulimab group showed an improved progression‐free survival compared with the placebo group, both in the intention‐to‐treat population (median 7·6 months, 95% CI 6·8–‐9·6 vs 4·2 months, 95% CI 4·2–4·3; HR 0·43, 95% CI 0·33–0·56; p<0·0001) and in the PD‐L1‐positive subgroup (8·1 months, 5·7–9·7 vs 4·2 months, 4·1–4·3; HR 0·37, 0·27–0·52, p<0·0001). Grade 3 or worse treatment‐emergent adverse events occurred in 120 (69%) 173 patients in the penpulimab group and 119 (68%) of 175 in the placebo group. Interpretation: Penpulimab plus chemotherapy significantly improved progression‐free survival in patients with advanced squamous non‐small‐cell lung cancer compared with chemotherapy alone. The treatment was safe and tolerable. Penpulimab combined with paclitaxel and carboplatin is a new option for first‐line treatment in patients with this advanced disease.

abstract = {ECOG‐ACRIN EA5181 is a current prospective, randomized trial that is investigating whether the addition of concomitant durvalumab to standard chemo/radiation followed by 1 year of consolidative durvalumab results in an overall survival benefit over standard chemo/radiation alone followed by 1 year of consolidative durvalumab in patients with locally advanced, unresectable non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Because multiple phase I/II trials have shown the relative safety of adding immunotherapy to chemo/radiation and due to the known synergism between chemotherapy and immunotherapy, it is hoped that concomitant durvalumab can reduce the relatively high incidence of local failure (38%‐46%) as seen in recent prospective, randomized trials of standard chemo/radiation in this patient population. We will review the history of radiation for LA‐NSCLC and discuss the role of induction, concurrent and consolidative chemotherapy as well as the concerns for late cardiac and pulmonary toxicities associated with treatment. Furthermore, we will review the potential role of next generation sequencing, PD‐L1, ctDNA and tumor mutation burden and their possible impact on this trial.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most patients with locally advanced, unresectable, non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have disease progression despite definitive chemoradiotherapy (chemotherapy plus concurrent radiation therapy). This phase 3 study compared the anti‐programmed death ligand 1 antibody durvalumab as consolidation therapy with placebo in patients with stage III NSCLC who did not have disease progression after two or more cycles of platinum‐based chemoradiotherapy. METHODS: We randomly assigned patients, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive durvalumab (at a dose of 10 mg per kilogram of body weight intravenously) or placebo every 2 weeks for up to 12 months. The study drug was administered 1 to 42 days after the patients had received chemoradiotherapy. The coprimary end points were progression‐free survival (as assessed by means of blinded independent central review) and overall survival (unplanned for the interim analysis). Secondary end points included 12‐month and 18‐month progression‐free survival rates, the objective response rate, the duration of response, the time to death or distant metastasis, and safety. RESULTS: Of 713 patients who underwent randomization, 709 received consolidation therapy (473 received durvalumab and 236 received placebo). The median progression‐free survival from randomization was 16.8 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 13.0 to 18.1) with durvalumab versus 5.6 months (95% CI, 4.6 to 7.8) with placebo (stratified hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.65; P<0.001); the 12‐month progression‐free survival rate was 55.9% versus 35.3%, and the 18‐month progression‐free survival rate was 44.2% versus 27.0%. The response rate was higher with durvalumab than with placebo (28.4% vs. 16.0%; P<0.001), and the median duration of response was longer (72.8% vs. 46.8% of the patients had an ongoing response at 18 months). The median time to death or distant metastasis was longer with durvalumab than with placebo (23.2 months vs. 14.6 months; P<0.001). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in 29.9% of the patients who received durvalumab and 26.1% of those who received placebo; the most common adverse event of grade 3 or 4 was pneumonia (4.4% and 3.8%, respectively). A total of 15.4% of patients in the durvalumab group and 9.8% of those in the placebo group discontinued the study drug because of adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Progression‐free survival was significantly longer with durvalumab than with placebo. The secondary end points also favored durvalumab, and safety was similar between the groups.

abstract = {Background: Etoposide plus either cisplatin or carboplatin (EP) had been the standard first‐line (1L) treatment for ES‐SCLC, with limited alternative therapies for more than three decades, until recent progress with immunotherapy in this setting. The Phase 3, randomised, open‐label, global CASPIAN study assessed EP ± durvalumab (D) ± tremelimumab (T) as 1L treatment for patients with ES‐SCLC, and D + EP demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in overall survival (OS) compared with EP alone (data cut‐off [DCO]: March 11, 2019): HR 0.73 (95% CI 0.59‐0.91; p=0.0047). After a median follow‐up of 25.1 months (DCO Jan 27, 2020), the OS benefit with D + EP vs EP was sustained (HR 0.75 [95% CI 0.62‐0.91; nominal p=0.0032]), and D + T + EP numerically improved OS vs EP (HR 0.82 [95% CI 0.68‐1.00; p=0.0451]), but did not reach statistical significance (p≤0.0418) per prespecified statistical plan. At 24 months, 22.2% of patients were alive in the D+ EP arm, 23.4% in the D + T + EP arm, and 14.4% in the EP arm. Here we report updated OS data from the CASPIAN study, after a median follow‐up of approx. 36 months. Methods: In the CASPIAN study, 805 patients with treatment‐naïve ES‐SCLC (WHO performance status 0/1) were randomised 1:1:1 to D 1500 mg + EP q3w, D 1500 mg + T 75 mg + EP q3w, or EP q3w, stratified by planned platinum (investigator's choice of carboplatin or cisplatin). Patients in the immunotherapy arms received 4 cycles of EP + D ± T, followed by maintenance D 1500 mg q4w until disease progression. Patients in the D + T+ EP arm received an additional dose of T 75 mg after EP. Patients in the EP arm received up to 6 cycles of EP in total, and optional prophylactic cranial irradiation at the investigator's discretion. The two primary endpoints were OS for D + EP vs EP and for D + T + EP vs EP. Result: We present mature OS data for patients in the CASPIAN study, based on a median follow‐up duration of approx. 36 months. Conclusion: This updated analysis of OS from the CASPIAN trial will provide further insight into long‐term survival benefit with D + EP and D + T + EP vs EP in 1L treatment of patients with ES‐SCLC.

abstract = {Background: PRIMALung is an EORTC‐sponsored study. Primary objective is to show that overall survival with brain MRI surveillance alone is non‐inferior to brain MRI surveillance combined with PCI in patients with SCLC. PCI is currently SOC in most institutions, but can be associated with neurocognitive toxicity and impact quality of life. 600 patients will be recruited from 50 EORTC centres in 10 countries. This study is currently recruiting and will play an important role in clarifying whether MRI surveillance is a viable strategy in SCLC. Furthermore, it will answer important questions about the role of PCI in the era of immunotherapy, particularly in ES‐SCLC. Methods: Key eligibility: ECOG performance status ≤ 2 patients with SCLC (Limited or Extensive‐Stage, stage I‐IV) who did not progress after (≤ 16 weeks from day 1 of last cycle of chemotherapy to randomisation) completed standard therapy. Absence of progression, brain metastases or leptomeningeal disease after completing therapy. Trial Interventions: Patients will be randomised 1:1 to receive brain MRI surveillance with or without PCI (25Gy in 10 fractions). Primary objective ‐ to show that overall survival with brain MRI surveillance alone is non‐inferior to brain MRI surveillance combined with PCI. Secondary objectives ‐ cognitive failure‐free survival, quality of life and acute/late toxicities according to CTCAE v5.0. The trial was open to recruitment on 27/10/2022.

abstract = {Introduction: In the phase 3 KEYNOTE‐604 study of pembrolizumab + etoposide/platinum (EP) versus placebo + EP as first‐line therapy for ES‐SCLC (NCT03066778), PFS was significantly improved with pembrolizumab + EP versus placebo + EP (HR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.61‐0.91]; P=0.0023) and although the HR for OS favored pembrolizumab + EP, the significance threshold was not met (HR, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.64‐0.98]; P=0.0164). We present updated results with ∼3.5 years of follow‐up and outcomes in patients who completed 35 cycles of pembrolizumab. Methods: Eligible patients with previously untreated ES‐SCLC were randomized 1:1 to pembrolizumab 200 mg or placebo Q3W for up to 35 cycles plus 4 cycles of standard‐dose EP. Dual primary endpoints were OS and PFS (RECISTv1.1, blinded central review) in the intent‐to‐treat (ITT) population. No alpha was allocated for this updated analysis. Results: Among 453 randomized patients in the ITT population (pembrolizumab + EP, n=228; placebo + EP, n=225), median (range) time from randomization to data cutoff (September 21, 2021) was 43.3 (37.8‐52.3) months. 54.8% of patients in the pembrolizumab + EP group and 66.2% in the placebo + EP group received subsequent therapy (11.2% vs 22.1% received subsequent immune checkpoint inhibitor). Efficacy outcomes, including OS and PFS, were improved with pembrolizumab + EP (Table). Among the as‐treated population, grade 3‐5 AEs occurred in 78.9% of 223 patients in the pembrolizumab + EP group and 77.1% of 223 patients in the placebo + EP group. Eighteen patients completed 35 cycles of pembrolizumab (median [range] time from randomization to database cutoff, 42.5 [38.2‐49.5] months); of these patients, 14 were alive as of the last assessment before data cutoff. ORR among these patients was 100% (95% CI, 81.5%‐100%; 2 CR, 16 PR), and median (range) DOR was not reached (14.1 to 46.8+ months). From the time of completing 35 cycles (∼2 years), median OS was not reached (95% CI, 16.6 months to not reached). Two‐year OS rate (95% CI) from the time of completing 35 cycles of pembrolizumab was 72.2% (39.5%‐89.2%). Conclusions: Pembrolizumab + EP continued to show clinically meaningful improvement in survival and manageable safety versus placebo + EP in patients with previously untreated ES‐SCLC; 3‐year OS rate was ∼3 times higher among patients who received pembrolizumab + EP. Patients who completed 35 cycles of pembrolizumab had durable responses. Data support the continued exploration of pembrolizumab‐based combinations for ES‐SCLC.

abstract = {Oligometastatic breast cancer, typically defined as the presence of 1–5 metastases, represents an intermediate state between locally advanced and widely metastatic disease. Emerging research suggests that oligometastatic cancer has a unique molecular signature distinct from widely metastatic disease, and that it carries a superior prognosis. Owing to its more limited capacity for widespread progression, oligometastatic disease may benefit from aggressive ablative therapy to known metastases. Options for ablation include surgical excision, radiofrequency ablation, and hypofractionated image–guided radiotherapy (HIGRT). The phase II SABR‐COMET trial, which enrolled patients with oligometastatic disease of multiple histologies and randomized them to HIGRT vs. standard of care, found a notable survival advantage in favor of HIGRT. Other data suggest that HIGRT may synergize with immunotherapy by releasing powerful cytokines that increase anti‐tumor immune surveillance and by recruiting tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, helping to overcome resistance to therapy. There are many ongoing trials exploring the role of ablative therapy, most notably HIGRT, with or without immunotherapy, for the treatment of oligometastatic breast cancer. We believe that patients with oligometastatic breast cancer should be offered enrollment on prospective clinical trials when possible. Outside the context of a clinical trial, we recommend that select patients with oligometastatic breast cancer be offered treatment with a curative approach, including ablative therapy to all sites of disease if it can be safely accomplished. Currently, selection criteria to consider for ablative therapy include longer disease‐free interval from diagnosis to metastasis (>2 years), fewer metastases, and fewer involved organs. Undoubtedly, new data will refine or even upend our understanding of the definition and optimal management of oligometastatic disease.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The survival outcomes of patients with advanced non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are variable. This study investigated whether pre‐ and on‐treatment lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) could better prognosticate and select patients for ICI therapy. METHODS: Using data from the POPLAR and OAK trials of atezolizumab versus docetaxel in previously treated advanced NSCLC, the authors assessed the prognostic and predictive value of pretreatment LDH (less than or equal to vs greater than the upper limit of normal). They further examined changes in on‐treatment LDH by performing landmark analyses and estimated overall survival (OS) distributions according to the LDH level stratified by the response category (complete response [CR]/partial response [PR] vs stable disease [SD]). They repeated pretreatment analyses in subgroups defined by the programmed death ligand 1 (PD‐L1) status. RESULTS: This study included 1327 patients with available pretreatment LDH. Elevated pretreatment LDH was associated with an adverse prognosis regardless of treatment (hazard ratio [HR] for atezolizumab OS, 1.49; P =.0001; HR for docetaxel OS, 1.30; P =.004; P for treatment by LDH interaction =.28). Findings for elevated pretreatment LDH were similar for patients with positive PD‐L1 expression treated with atezolizumab. Persistently elevated on‐treatment LDH was associated with a 1.3‐ to 2.8‐fold increased risk of death at weeks 6, 12, 18, and 24 regardless of treatment. Elevated LDH at 6 weeks was associated with significantly shorter OS regardless of radiological response (HR for CR/PR, 2.10; P =.04; HR for SD, 1.50; P <.01), with similar findings observed at 12 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: In previously treated advanced NSCLC, elevated pretreatment LDH is an independent adverse prognostic marker. There is no evidence that pretreatment LDH predicts ICI benefit. Persistently elevated on‐treatment LDH is associated with worse OS despite radiologic response.},

abstract = {Background: A substantial proportion of patients with unresectable stage III non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cannot either tolerate or access concurrent chemoradiotherapy, so sequential chemoradiotherapy is commonly used. We assessed the efficacy and safety of sugemalimab, an anti‐PD‐L1 antibody, in patients with stage III NSCLC whose disease had not progressed after concurrent or sequential chemoradiotherapy. Methods: GEMSTONE‐301 is a randomised, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, phase 3 trial in patients with locally advanced, unresectable, stage III NSCLC, done at 50 hospitals or academic research centres in China. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 who had not progressed after concurrent or sequential chemoradiotherapy. We randomly assigned patients (2:1, using an interactive voice–web response system) to receive sugemalimab 1200 mg or matching placebo, intravenously every 3 weeks for up to 24 months. Stratification factors were ECOG performance status, previous chemoradiotherapy, and total radiotherapy dose. The investigators, trial coordination staff, patients, and study sponsor were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was progression‐free survival as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) in the intention‐to‐treat population. Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of assigned study treatment. The study has completed enrolment and the results of a preplanned analysis of the primary endpoint are reported here. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03728556. Findings: Between Aug 30, 2018 and Dec 30, 2020, we screened 564 patients of whom 381 were eligible. Study treatment was received by all patients randomly assigned to sugemalimab (n=255) and to placebo (n=126). At data cutoff (March 8, 2021), median follow‐up was 14·3 months (IQR 6·4–19·4) for patients in the sugemalimab group and 13·7 months (7·1–18·4) for patients in the placebo group. Progression‐free survival assessed by BICR was significantly longer with sugemalimab than with placebo (median 9·0 months [95% CI 8·1–14·1] vs 5·8 months [95% CI 4·2–6·6]; stratified hazard ratio 0·64 [95% CI 0·48–0·85], p=0·0026). Grade 3 or 4 treatment‐related adverse events occurred in 22 (9%) of 255 patients in the sugemalimab group versus seven (6%) of 126 patients in the placebo group, the most common being pneumonitis or immune‐mediated pneumonitis (seven [3%] of 255 patients in the sugemalimab group vs one [<1%] of 126 in the placebo group). Treatment‐related serious adverse events occurred in 38 (15%) patients in the sugemalimab group and 12 (10%) in the placebo group. Treatment‐related deaths were reported in four (2%) of 255 patients (pneumonia in two patients, pneumonia with immune‐mediated pneumonitis in one patient, and acute hepatic failure in one patient) in the sugemalimab group and none in the placebo group. Interpretation: Sugemalimab after definitive concurrent or sequential chemoradiotherapy could be an effective consolidation therapy for patients with stage III NSCLC whose disease has not progressed after sequential or concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Longer follow‐up is needed to confirm this conclusion. Funding: CStone Pharmaceuticals and the National Key Research and Development Program of China.

abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Administration of durvalumab after concurrent chemoradiotherapy is the standard treatment of unresectable, locally advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); however, 20% to 30% of patients do not receive durvalumab because of adverse events (AEs) during concurrent chemoradiotherapy. In addition, radiotherapy and immunotherapy have a synergistic effect. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy and safety of durvalumab immunotherapy plus concurrent radiotherapy followed by maintenance with durvalumab therapy for treatment of locally advanced NSCLC without chemotherapy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The multicenter, single‐arm DOLPHIN (Phase II Study of Durvalumab [MEDI4736] Plus Concurrent Radiation Therapy in Advanced Localized NSCLC Patients) nonrandomized controlled trial was performed by 12 institutions in Japan from September 13, 2019, to May 31, 2022. Participants in the primary registration phase included 74 patients with programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD‐L1)‐positive, unresectable, locally advanced NSCLC. The current analyses were conducted from June 1, 2022, to October 31, 2022. INTERVENTIONS: Patients received radiotherapy (60 Gy) in combination with concurrent and maintenance durvalumab immunotherapy, 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks, for up to 1 year. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point of the rate of 12‐month progression‐free survival (PFS), as assessed by an independent central review, was estimated using the Kaplan‐Meier method and evaluated with 90% CIs calculated using the Greenwood formula. The key secondary end points were PFS, objective response rate, treatment completion rate, and AEs. RESULTS: Data from 35 patients (median [range] age, 72 [44‐83] years; 31 [88.6%] men) were included in the full analysis set of the evaluable population. The 12‐month PFS rate was 72.1% (90% CI, 59.1%‐85.1%), and the median PFS was 25.6 months (95% CI, 13.1 months to not estimable) at a median follow‐up of 22.8 months (range, 4.3‐31.8 months). Scheduled radiation therapy was completed in 97.1% of patients. The confirmed objective response rate was 90.9% (95% CI, 75.7%‐98.1%), and the treatment completion rate was 57.6% (95% CI, 39.2%‐74.5%). Among 34 patients evaluated in the safety analysis set, AEs of grade 3 or 4 occurred in 18 patients (52.9%), and of grade 5 in 2 patients (5.9%). Pneumonitis or radiation pneumonitis of any grade occurred in 23 patients (67.6%), and of grades 3 or 4 in 4 patients (11.8%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Findings from this phase 2 nonrandomized controlled trial indicate that durvalumab immunotherapy combined with curative radiotherapy for patients with PD‐L1‐positive, unresectable, locally advanced NSCLC is a promising treatment with tolerable AEs and is appropriate as a study treatment for phase 3 clinical trials.

abstract = {Purpose/Objective(s): CAPSTONE‐1, a phase 3 trial, showed that SHR‐1316 (PD‐L1 antibody) combined with standard first‐line chemotherapy could prolong overall survival (OS) in patients (pts) with ES‐SCLC. The CREST trial reported consolidative thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) of 30 Gy in 10 fractions provided a 10% 2‐year OS benefit and more intensive TRT should be investigated in ES‐SCLC. In the era of immunotherapy, the role of TRT also needs further exploration. Therefore, we designed this clinical trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of SHR‐1316 plus first‐line chemotherapy followed by TRT combined with SHR‐1316. Materials/Methods: Key inclusion criteria were pts aged 18‐75 years, with previously untreated histologically or cytologically confirmed ES‐SCLC, and an ECOG performance status of 0‐1. Eligible pts would receive 4∼6 cycles of SHR‐1316 (20mg/kg, D1, q3w) combined with EP/EC (etoposide, 100mg/m2, D1‐5, q3w and cisplatin, 75mg/m², D1‐3, q3w or carboplatin, AUC = 5, D1, q3w), followed by SHR‐1316 combined with TRT (≥3 Gy*10 f or ≥2 Gy*25 f, involved‐field irradiation), and then the maintenance therapy with SHR‐1316 until disease progression or intolerable adverse events (AEs). The main endpoints included ORR, PFS and safety. Results: From October 2020 to January 2023, 33 pts received SHR‐1316 and sequential consolidative TRT. Among them, 19 pts received high‐dose TRT (>3 Gy*10 f or ≥2 Gy*25 f) and 14 pts received low‐dose TRT (≤3 Gy*10 f or<2 Gy*25 f). The median age was 62 (range: 38‐73). Most pts were male (28, 84.8%), former smokers (22, 66.7%) with an ECOG performance status 1 (32, 97%). Ten (30.3%) pts were diagnosed with brain metastasis and 10 (30.3%) pts had liver metastasis at baseline. At the data cutoff date, 9 pts remained on treatment, the average number of treatment cycles was 9.2. 33 pts had at least one 1 post‐treatment tumor assessment. The confirmed ORR and DCR were 90.9% (30/33) and 100% (33/33) in all pts, were 89.5% (17/19) and 100% (19/19) in high‐dose TRT group, and were 92.9% (13/14) and 100% (14/14) in low‐dose TRT group. The median PFS was 10.2(CI: 5.8∼14.7) months in all pts, was 7 (CI: 3.8∼10.2) months in high‐dose TRT group and 10.4 (CI: 8.4∼12.3) months in low‐dose TRT group. AEs occurred in 27 (81.8%) pts and grade 3 or 4 AEs occurred in 20 (60.6%) pts. The most common grade 3 or 4 AEs included neutropenia (15, 45.5%), leukopenia (8, 24.2%), lymphocytopenia (5, 15.2%), pneumonia (3, 9.1%), anemia (3, 9.1%) and thrombocytopenia (2, 6.1%). Conclusion: SHR‐1316 plus chemotherapy and sequential TRT as first‐line therapy for ES‐SCLC showed promising efficacy and acceptable safety. There is no significant difference between high‐dose and low‐dose TRT groups in terms of safety and efficacy according to current data.},

abstract = {Importance: Treatment with nivolumab‐ipilimumab combination therapy was found to improve overall survival compared with chemotherapy among patients with advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the CheckMate 227 clinical trial. However, these drugs are substantially more expensive than chemotherapy and, given the high incidence of advanced NSCLC, the incorporation of dual immune checkpoint inhibitors into the standard of care could have substantial economic consequences. Objective: To assess whether nivolumab‐ipilimumab combination therapy is a cost‐effective first‐line treatment for patients with advanced NSCLC. Design, Setting, and Participants: This economic evaluation designed a Markov model to compare the cost‐effectiveness of nivolumab‐ipilimumab combination therapy with platinum‐doublet chemotherapy as first‐line treatment for patients with advanced NSCLC. The Markov model was created to simulate patients with advanced NSCLC who were receiving either nivolumab‐ipilimumab combination therapy or platinum‐doublet chemotherapy. Transition probabilities, including disease progression, survival, and treatment toxic effects, were derived using data from the CheckMate 227 clinical trial. Costs and health utilities were obtained from published literature. Data analyses were conducted from November 2019 to September 2020. Exposures: Nivolumab‐ipilimumab combination therapy. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary study outcomes were quality‐adjusted life‐years (QALYs) and cost in 2020 US dollars. Cost‐effectiveness was measured using an incremental cost‐effectiveness ratio (ICER), with an ICER less than $100000 per QALY considered cost‐effective. Model uncertainty was assessed with 1‐way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Results: Treatment with nivolumab‐ipilimumab combination therapy was associated with an increase in overall cost of $201900 and improved effectiveness of 0.50 QALYs compared with chemotherapy, yielding an ICER of $401700 per QALY. The study model was sensitive to the cost and duration of immunotherapy. Treatment with nivolumab‐ipilimumab combination therapy became cost‐effective when monthly treatment costs were reduced from $26425 to $5058 (80.9% reduction) or when the maximum duration of immunotherapy was reduced from 24.0 months to 1.4 months. The model was not sensitive to assumptions about survival or programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 status. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that, at a willingness‐to‐pay threshold of $100000 per QALY, nivolumab‐ipilimumab combination therapy was less cost‐effective than chemotherapy 99.9% of the time. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, first‐line treatment with nivolumab‐ipilimumab combination therapy was not found to be cost‐effective at current prices despite clinical trial data indicating that this regimen increases overall survival among patients with advanced NSCLC..},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The human IgG4 monoclonal antibody nivolumab targets programmed cell death‐1 (PD‐1) and promotes antitumor response by blocking the interaction of PD‐1 with its ligands. This single‐center phase Ib study investigated the tolerability, safety, and pharmacokinetics of nivolumab combined with standard chemotherapy in patients with advanced non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients who had stage IIIB without indication for definitive radiotherapy, stage IV, or recurrent NSCLC were eligible. Regimens were nivolumab 10 mg/kg + gemcitabine/cisplatin (arm A), pemetrexed/cisplatin (arm B), paclitaxel/carboplatin/bevacizumab (arm C), or docetaxel (arm D). Regimens A, B, and D were repeated every 3 weeks for up to four cycles and regimen C was repeated for up to six cycles; nivolumab alone (arm A), with pemetrexed (arm B), bevacizumab (arm C), or docetaxel (arm D) was continued every 3 weeks as maintenance therapy until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Dose‐limiting toxicity (DLT) was evaluated during the first treatment cycle. RESULTS: As of March 2014, six patients were enrolled in each arm. The combination of nivolumab 10 mg/kg and chemotherapy was well tolerated. DLT was observed in only one patient in arm A (alanine aminotransferase increased). Select adverse events (those with a potential immunologic cause) of any grade were observed in six, four, six, and five patients in arms A, B, C, and D, respectively. Three, three, six, and one patient achieved partial response while median progression‐free survival was 6.28, 9.63 months, not reached, and 3.15 months in arms A, B, C, and D, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Combination of nivolumab 10 mg/kg and chemotherapy showed an acceptable toxicity profile and encouraging antitumor activity in patients with advanced NSCLC.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) is the standard treatment for locally advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (LANSCLC) patients, but the treatment response and survival outcomes varied among these patients. We aimed to identify pretreatment computed tomography‐based radiomics features extracted from tumor and tumor organismal environment (TOE) for long‐term survival prediction in these patients treated with CCRT. METHODS: A total of 298 eligible patients were randomly assigned into the training cohort and validation cohort with a ratio 2:1. An integrated feature selection and model training approach using support vector machine combined with genetic algorithm was performed to predict 3‐year overall survival (OS). Patients were stratified into the high‐risk and low‐risk group based on the predicted survival status. Pulmonary function test and blood gas analysis indicators were associated with radiomic features. Dynamic changes of peripheral blood lymphocytes counts before and after CCRT had been documented. RESULTS: Nine features including 5 tumor‐related features and 4 pulmonary features were selected in the predictive model. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the training and validation cohort were 0.965 and 0.869, and were reduced by 0.179 and 0.223 when all pulmonary features were excluded. Based on radiomics‐derived stratification, the low‐risk group yielded better 3‐year OS (68.4% vs. 3.3%, p < 0.001) than the high‐risk group. Patients in the low‐risk group had better baseline FEV1/FVC% (96.3% vs. 85.9%, p = 0.046), less Grade ≥ 3 lymphopenia during CCRT (63.2% vs. 83.3%, p = 0.031), better recovery of lymphopenia from CCRT (71.4% vs. 27.8%, p < 0.001), lower incidence of Grade ≥ 2 radiation‐induced pneumonitis (31.6% vs. 53.3%, p = 0.040), superior tumor remission (84.2% vs. 66.7%, p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: Pretreatment radiomics features from tumor and TOE could boost the long‐term survival forecast accuracy in LANSCLC patients, and the predictive results could be utilized as an effective indicator for survival risk stratification. Low‐risk patients might benefit more from radical CCRT and further adjuvant immunotherapy. TRIAL REGISTRATION: retrospectively registered.},

abstract = {Objectives: Since specific data on immunotherapy in older adults with advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (aNSCLC) are scarce, we designed this study to determine the overall survival (OS) at one year of first‐line pembrolizumab in patients older than 70 years with aNSCLC expressing PD‐L1. Secondary objectives included progression‐free survival, disease‐specific survival, response rate, tolerability, quality of life (QoL) changes, and geriatric assessments. Materials and methods: A single‐arm, open‐label, phase II clinical trial was carried out by the Spanish Lung Cancer Group between February 2018 and November 2019 at ten active sites in Spain. We included patients 70 years old and older with histological or cytological documented stage IIIB or IV aNSCLC and PD‐L1 expression ≥ 1%. Each subject received 200 mg of intravenous pembrolizumab every three weeks for a maximum of two years. Results: 83 patients were recruited for the study and 74 were finally analysed. Most were male (N = 64, 86.5%) and former smokers (N = 51, 68.9%). 24 patients (32.4%) completed at least one year of treatment, 62 (83.7%) discontinued treatment, and 30 (40.5%) experienced disease progression. The median follow‐up of our cohort was 18.0 months [range: 0.1–47.7] and 46 patients (62.2%) died during the period of study. The estimated OS at one year was 61.7% (95% CI: 49.6–71.8%) and the median OS of our cohort was 19.2 months (95% CI: 11.3–25.5). QoL tended to improve throughout the study, although the differences were not statistically significant. The main geriatric scores remained stable, except for a worsening in nutritional status (P = 0.004) and an improvement in frailty (P = 0.028). Conclusion: Our results support treating older adults with aNSCLC expressing PD‐L1 with pembrolizumab in monotherapy. The stability of most geriatric scores and the positive trend on the patients’ QoL should be highlighted, although our results did not reach statistical significance.},

abstract = {From November 1976 to November 1978, the Southwest Oncology Group treated 254 patients with extensive (metastatic) small cell carcinoma of the lung with combination chemotherapy and radiotherapy with and without BCG immunotherapy. Patients receiving BCG achieved a response rate of 50% versus those patients not receiving BCG of 46% (P = .704). Response duration was 20 weeks for the BCG arms and 23 weeks for the no‐BCG arms; survival was 28 weeks for the BCG arms versus 29 weeks for the no‐BCG arms. An adverse effect in patients surviving more than one year was detected; those continuing to receive BCG had significantly shorter survival, 60 weeks versus 85 weeks (P = .019). Toxicities of the programs were not affected by the addition of BCG immunotherapy. It appears that BCG immunotherapy has no beneficial effect on response rate or duration of response in programs using chemotherapy and radiotherapy for control of metastatic small cell carcinoma of the lung. In addition, because of the adverse effect on long‐term survival, we do not recommend the addition of BCG immunotherapy as a treatment modality in this tumor type.},

abstract = {Background The landmark study of durvalumab as consolidation therapy in NSCLC patients (PACIFIC trial) demonstrated significantly longer progression‐free survival (PFS) in patients with locally advanced, unresectable non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with durvalumab (immunotherapy, IO) therapy after chemoradiotherapy (CRT). In clinical practice in the USA, durvalumab continues to be used in patients across all levels of programmed cell death ligand‐1 (PD‐L1) expression. While immune therapies have shown promise in several cancers, some patients either do not respond to the therapy or have cancer recurrence after an initial response. It is not clear so far who will benefit of this therapy or what the mechanisms behind treatment failure are. Methods A total of 133 patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC who underwent durvalumab after CRT or CRT alone were included. Patients treated with durvalumab IO after CRT were randomly split into training (D1=59) and test (D2=59) sets and the remaining 15 patients treated with CRT alone were grouped in D3. Radiomic textural patterns from within and around the target nodules were extracted. A radiomic risk score (RRS) was built and was used to predict PFS and overall survival (OS). Patients were divided into high‐risk and low‐risk groups based on median RRS. Results RRS was found to be significantly associated with PFS in D1 (HR=2.67, 95% CI 1.85 to 4.13, p<0.05, C‐index=0.78) and D2 (HR=2.56, 95% CI 1.63 to 4, p<0.05, C‐index=0.73). Similarly, RRS was associated with OS in D1 (HR=1.89, 95% CI 1.3 to 2.75, p<0.05, C‐index=0.67) and D2 (HR=2.14, 95% CI 1.28 to 3.6, p<0.05, C‐index=0.69), respectively. RRS was found to be significantly associated with PFS in high PD‐L1 (HR=3.01, 95% CI 1.41 to 6.45, p=0.0044) and low PD‐L1 (HR=2.74, 95% CI 1.8 to 4.14, p=1.77e‐06) groups. Moreover, RRS was not significantly associated with OS in the high PD‐L1 group (HR=2.08, 95% CI 0.98 to 4.4, p=0.054) but was significantly associated with OS in the low PD‐L1 group (HR=1.61, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.28, p=0.0062). In addition, RRS was significantly associated with PFS (HR=2.77, 95% CI 1.17 to 6.52, p=0.019, C‐index=0.77) and OS (HR=2.62, 95% CI 1.25 to 5.51, p=0.01, C‐index=0.77) in D3, respectively. Conclusions Tumor radiomics of pretreatment CT images from patients with stage III unresectable NSCLC were prognostic of PFS and OS to CRT followed by durvalumab IO and CRT alone.},

abstract = {Importance: Consolidative programmed death ligand‐1 (PD‐L) inhibition after chemoradiotherapy improves overall survival and progression‐free survival (PFS) for stage III non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and requires safety evaluation for incorporation of programmed cell death 1 (PD‐1) inhibition at the onset of chemoradiotherapy. Objective: To determine the safety and tolerability of PD‐1 inhibition concurrently with definitive chemoradiotherapy for NSCLC. Design, Setting, and Participants: This phase 1 prospective multicenter nonrandomized controlled trial using a 3 plus 3 design was performed from August 30, 2016, to October 24, 2018, with a median follow‐up of 16.0 (95% CI, 12.0‐22.6) months and data locked on July 25, 2019. Twenty‐one participants had locally advanced, unresectable, stage III NSCLC as determined by multidisciplinary review, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 or 1, and adequate hematologic, renal, and hepatic function. Data were analyzed from October 17, 2016, to July 19, 2019. Interventions: Pembrolizumab was combined with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (weekly carboplatin and paclitaxel with 60 Gy of radiation in 2 Gy per d). Dose cohorts evaluated included full‐dose pembrolizumab (200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks) 2 to 6 weeks after chemoradiotherapy (cohort 1); reduced‐dose pembrolizumab (100 mg intravenously every 3 weeks) starting day 29 of chemoradiotherapy (cohort 2); full‐dose pembrolizumab starting day 29 of chemoradiotherapy (cohort 3); reduced‐dose pembrolizumab starting day 1 of chemoradiotherapy (cohort 4); and full‐dose pembrolizumab starting day 1 of chemoradiotherapy (cohort 5). A safety expansion cohort of 6 patients was planned based on the maximum tolerated dose of pembrolizumab. Dose‐limiting toxic effects were defined as pneumonitis of at least grade 4 within cycle 1 of pembrolizumab treatment. Main Outcomes and Measures: Safety and tolerability of PD‐1 inhibition with chemoradiotherapy for NSCLC. Secondary outcomes included PFS and pneumonitis rates. Results: Among the 21 patients included in the analysis (11 female [52%]; median age, 69.5 [range, 53.0‐85.0] years), no dose‐limiting toxic effects in any cohort were observed. One case of grade 5 pneumonitis occurred in the safety expansion cohort with the cohort 5 regimen. Immune‐related adverse events of at least grade 3 occurred in 4 patients (18%). Median PFS for patients who received at least 1 dose of pembrolizumab (n = 21) was 18.7 (95% CI, 11.8‐29.4) months, and 6‐ and 12‐month PFS were 81.0% (95% CI, 64.1%‐97.7%) and 69.7% (95% CI, 49.3%‐90.2%), respectively. Median PFS for patients who received at least 2 doses of pembrolizumab (n = 19) was 21.0 (95% CI, 15.3 to infinity) months. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that combined treatment with PD‐1 inhibitors and chemoradiotherapy for stage III NSCLC is tolerable, with promising PFS of 69.7% at 12 months, and requires further study.

abstract = {Background Avelumab, a human Ig‐G1 monoclonal antibody targeting PD‐L1 and approved in the USA for the treatment of metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma, has shown antitumour activity and an acceptable safety profile in patients with advanced solid tumours in a dose‐escalation phase 1a trial. In this dose‐expansion cohort of that trial, we assess avelumab treatment in a cohort of patients with advanced, platinum‐treated non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods In this dose‐expansion cohort of a multicentre, open‐label, phase 1 study, patients with progressive or platinum‐resistant metastatic or recurrent NSCLC were enrolled at 58 cancer treatment centres and academic hospitals in the USA. Eligible patients had confirmed stage IIIB or IV NSCLC with squamous or non‐squamous histology, measurable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), tumour biopsy or archival sample for biomarker assessment, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 or 1, among other criteria. Patient selection was not based on PD‐L1 expression or expression of other biomarkers, including EGFR or KRAS mutation or ALK translocation status. Patients received infusional avelumab monotherapy 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks until disease progression or toxicity. The primary objective was to assess safety and tolerability. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01772004; enrolment in this cohort is closed and the trial is ongoing. Findings Between Sept 10, 2013, and June 24, 2014, 184 patients were enrolled and initiated treatment with avelumab. Median follow‐up duration was 8·8 months (IQR 7·2–11·9). The most common treatment‐related adverse events of any grade were fatigue (46 [25%] of 184 patients), infusion‐related reaction (38 [21%]), and nausea (23 [13%]). Grade 3 or worse treatment‐related adverse events occurred in 23 (13%) of 184 patients; the most common (occurring in more than two patients) were infusion‐related reaction (four [2%] patients) and increased lipase level (three [2%]). 16 (9%) of 184 patients had a serious adverse event related to treatment with avelumab, with infusion‐related reaction (in four [2%] patients) and dyspnoea (in two [1%]) occurring in more than one patient. Serious adverse events irrespective of cause occurred in 80 (44%) of 184 patients. Those occurring in more than five patients (≥3%) were dyspnoea (ten patients [5%]), pneumonia (nine [5%]), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (six [3%]). Immune‐related treatment‐related events occurred in 22 patients (12%). Of 184 patients, 22 (12% [95% CI 8–18]) achieved a confirmed objective response, including one complete response and 21 partial responses. 70 (38%) had stable disease. Overall, 92 (50%) of 184 patients achieved disease control (they had a confirmed response or stable disease as their best overall response). One patient was initially thought to have died from grade 5 radiation pneumonitis during the study; however, this adverse event was subsequently regraded to grade 3 and the death was attributed to disease progression. Interpretation Avelumab showed an acceptable safety profile and antitumour activity in patients with progressive or treatment‐resistant NSCLC, providing a rationale for further studies of avelumab in this disease setting.

abstract = {Nivolumab is superior to docetaxel monotherapy as second line treatment in advanced stage non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. However, the long term survival advantage seems to be limited to a 20% proportion of treated patients. To date, no definitive biomarker, including tumor cells or infiltrative cells PD‐L1 expression, has been demonstrated to predict nivolumab (or other PD1 or PD‐L1 inhibitors) efficacy. Ipilimumab has also suggested efficacy in the same patient population. Finally, the addition of ipilimumab to nivolumab has a suggested better efficacy over nivolumab alone in advanced stage NSCLC patients with an acceptable safety profile. In parallel, hypo‐fractionated radiotherapy alone has been suggested to elicit the immune system activity as demonstrated by the occurrence of an abscopal effect. Some case reports in melanoma but also lung cancer patients reinforced this hypothesis. Furthermore, preclinical and clinical data suggest that radiation may have a synergistic effect with antibodies targeting the immune checkpoints (PD1, PD‐L1, CTLA4) and improve antitumor efficacy. Moreover, it has been shown that fractionated radiotherapy delivered in combination with aPD‐1 or aPD‐L1 mAbs is able to generate efficacious CD8þ T‐cell responses that will in turn improve local tumor control, long‐term survival, and protection against tumor rechallenge. Therefore, the combination of single fraction or hypo‐fractionated radiotherapy with the anti PD1 nivolumab and/or the anti CTLA4 ipilimumab warrants further investigation. However, a large number of doses, sequences and schedules remain possible. In order to select the best combination, a mathematical modeling of immunotherapy in cancer and its synergy with radiotherapy has been set up. This work provides with mathematical formulas to link the drug serum concentrations of nivolumab and ipilimumab, and the dose of radiation therapy, to the immune response. In silico, the single and three fractions schedule have been found to have the same efficacy while activation of the immune response seems to be better using a hypo‐fractionated (less than 6 fractions) radiotherapy in vivo.},

abstract = {Background: Organ‐specific metastatic context has not been incorporated into the clinical practice of guiding programmed death‐(ligand) 1 [PD‐(L)1] blockade, due to a lack of understanding of its predictive versus prognostic value. We aim at delineating and then incorporating both the predictive and prognostic effects of the metastatic‐organ landscape to dissect PD‐(L)1 blockade efficacy in non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods: A total of 2062 NSCLC patients from a double‐arm randomized trial (OAK), two immunotherapy trials (FIR, BIRCH), and a real‐world cohort (NFyy) were included. The metastatic organs were stratified into two categories based on their treatment‐dependent predictive significance versus treatment‐independent prognosis. A metastasis‐based scoring system (METscore) was developed and validated for guiding PD‐(L)1 blockade in clinical trials and real‐world practice. Results: Patients harboring various organ‐specific metastases presented significantly different responses to immunotherapy, and those with brain and adrenal gland metastases survived longer than others [overall survival (OS), p = 0.0105; progression‐free survival (PFS), p = 0.0167]. In contrast, survival outcomes were similar in chemotherapy‐treated patients regardless of metastatic sites (OS, p = 0.3742; PFS, p = 0.8242). Intriguingly, the immunotherapeutic predictive significance of the metastatic‐organ landscape was specifically presented in PD‐L1‐positive populations (PD‐L1 > 1%). Among them, a paradoxical coexistence of a favorable predictive effect coupled with an unfavorable prognostic effect was observed in metastases to adrenal glands, brain, and liver (category I organs), whereas metastases to bone, pleura, pleural effusion, and mediastinum yielded consistent unfavorable predictive and prognostic effects (category II organs). METscore was capable of integrating both predictive and prognostic effects of the entire landscape and dissected OS outcome of NSCLC patients received PD‐(L)1 blockade (p < 0.0001) but not chemotherapy (p = 0.0805) in the OAK training cohort. Meanwhile, general performance of METscore was first validated in FIR (p = 0.0350) and BIRCH (p < 0.0001), and then in the real‐world NFyy cohort (p = 0.0181). Notably, METscore was also applicable to patients received PD‐(L)1 blockade as first‐line treatment both in the clinical trials (OS, p = 0.0087; PFS, p = 0.0290) and in the real‐world practice (OS, p = 0.0182; PFS, p = 0.0045). Conclusions: Organ‐specific metastatic landscape served as a potential predictor of immunotherapy, and METscore might enable noninvasive forecast of PD‐(L)1 blockade efficacy using baseline radiologic assessments in advanced NSCLC.},

Herein, we evaluated the preliminary efficacy and safety of combined immunotherapy and antiangiogenic therapy in patients with previously treated advanced NSCLC in a real‐world setting. Methods: We conducted a 2‐center, retrospective study of previously treated advanced NSCLC patients who received any anti‐programmed death‐1 antibody combined with antiangiogenic agent between May 2018 and March 2020. Results: In total, 57 patients were included in this study, and the objective response rate and disease control rate were 19.3% and 63.2%, respectively. The median progression‐free survival (PFS) was 4.2 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.2–5.2 months). Bone metastases (odds ratio [OR] not available; P < .01) and ≥ 3 treatment lines (OR 6.8; 95% CI: 1.6–29.6; P < .05) were independent negative predictors of objective response. Additionally, liver metastases (hazard ratio [HR] 3.7; 95% CI: 1.6–8.5; P < 0.01), poor performance status score (PS) (HR 3.4; 95% CI: 1.6–7.5; P < 0.01) and ≥ 3 treatment lines (HR 3.5; 95% CI: 1.7–7.4; P < 0.01) were found to be negative predictors of PFS. Eighty‐nine percent of the patients experienced an adverse event. Conclusions: Metastatic sites (bone and liver), ≥3 treatment lines and poor PS were potential negative predictors of the efficacy of immunotherapy combined with antiangiogenic therapy for treating NSCLC.

abstract = {Background: Tumor HP has been suggested to occur in some patients with solid tumors subsequent to PD‐1/L1 inhibitor monotherapy; however, reports are based on nonrandomized, single‐arm studies. Previous post‐hoc analysis of HP with nivo was performed in the phase III ATTRACTION‐2 trial, which randomized patients with gastric cancer who received ≥2 prior lines of therapy to nivo or pbo. Using the pbo arm as a surrogate for natural course of disease progression, nivo was not associated with HP at≥20,≥50, or≥100% tumor growth rates. The current analysis expands this framework to assess HP in patients with extensive disease small cell lung cancer (ED SCLC) in the randomized, pbo‐controlled CheckMate 451 trial. Methods: CheckMate 451 was a phase III double‐blind study that evaluated maintenance treatment in patients with ED SCLC without disease progression after platinumbased 1L chemotherapy. Patients were randomized to nivo 240 mg, nivo 1 mg/kg + ipilimumab 3 mg/kg, or pbo, within 9 weeks from the last dose of 1L chemotherapy (or≥11 weeks for those receiving PCI or whole brain radiotherapy); HP analysis focused on the nivo (n=280) and pbo (n=275) arms. Tumor assessments occurred every 6 weeks for the first 36 weeks, then every 12 weeks until disease progression. HP was calculated as changes in size of the primary lesion (sum of longest diameters [SLD]), as assessed retrospectively among patients who had baseline and≥1 on‐treatment tumor measurement available (nivo, n=177; pbo, n=175). Results: Baseline characteristics were balanced between treatment arms in the analysis population. Median increase in tumor size from baseline to first on‐treatment assessment in the maintenance period was 2% with nivo vs 17% with pbo. Compared to the pbo arm, fewer patients on nivo had SLD increases of ≥20% (27% vs 46%), ≥50% (10% vs 22%), and≥100% (3% vs 6%) at the first on‐treatment scan. Conclusions: In this analysis, nivo was not associated with HP in the pbo‐controlled CheckMate 451 trial. These data are consistent with the previous analysis of ATTRACTION‐2, suggesting that reports of HP with immunotherapy may reflect some patients' natural course of disease.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most patients with locally advanced, unresectable, non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have disease progression despite definitive chemoradiotherapy (chemotherapy plus concurrent radiation therapy). This phase 3 study compared the anti‐programmed death ligand 1 antibody durvalumab as consolidation therapy with placebo in patients with stage III NSCLC who did not have disease progression after two or more cycles of platinum‐based chemoradiotherapy. METHODS: We randomly assigned patients, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive durvalumab (at a dose of 10 mg per kilogram of body weight intravenously) or placebo every 2 weeks for up to 12 months. The study drug was administered 1 to 42 days after the patients had received chemoradiotherapy. The coprimary end points were progression‐free survival (as assessed by means of blinded independent central review) and overall survival (unplanned for the interim analysis). Secondary end points included 12‐month and 18‐month progression‐free survival rates, the objective response rate, the duration of response, the time to death or distant metastasis, and safety. RESULTS: Of 713 patients who underwent randomization, 709 received consolidation therapy (473 received durvalumab and 236 received placebo). The median progression‐free survival from randomization was 16.8 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 13.0 to 18.1) with durvalumab versus 5.6 months (95% CI, 4.6 to 7.8) with placebo (stratified hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.65; P<0.001); the 12‐month progression‐free survival rate was 55.9% versus 35.3%, and the 18‐month progression‐free survival rate was 44.2% versus 27.0%. The response rate was higher with durvalumab than with placebo (28.4% vs. 16.0%; P<0.001), and the median duration of response was longer (72.8% vs. 46.8% of the patients had an ongoing response at 18 months). The median time to death or distant metastasis was longer with durvalumab than with placebo (23.2 months vs. 14.6 months; P<0.001). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in 29.9% of the patients who received durvalumab and 26.1% of those who received placebo; the most common adverse event of grade 3 or 4 was pneumonia (4.4% and 3.8%, respectively). A total of 15.4% of patients in the durvalumab group and 9.8% of those in the placebo group discontinued the study drug because of adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Progression‐free survival was significantly longer with durvalumab than with placebo. The secondary end points also favored durvalumab, and safety was similar between the groups.

Our previous sturdy indicated that patients who received induction immunotherapy and subsequent radiotherapy suffered higher proportion of pneumonitis.Grade 2 or more pneumonitis patients have worse prognosis. It is urged to optimize the radiotherapy dose and target volume for patients treated with immunotherapy and radiotherapy. According to retrospective and prospective studies, omitting CTV radiation is feasible for patients undergoing concurrent radio‐chemotherapy for locally advanced NSCLC. It is postulated that omitting CTV radiation for patients responded to induction therapy with immunotherapy and chemotherapy will have less pneumonitis without sacrificing the local control rate. Omitting CTV may also retain better immune function which will facilitate the immunotherapy.},

Combining ICI with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/VEGF receptor inhibition has yielded promising results in multiple tumor types.METHODSIn this randomized phase II Lung‐MAP nonmatch substudy (S1800A), patients ineligible for a biomarker‐matched substudy with NSCLC previously treated with ICI and platinum‐based chemotherapy and progressive disease at least 84 days after initiation of ICI were randomly assigned to receive ramucirumab plus pembrolizumab (RP) or investigator's choice standard of care (SOC: docetaxel/ramucirumab, docetaxel, gemcitabine, and pemetrexed). With a goal of 130 eligible patients, the primary objective was to compare overall survival (OS) using a one‐sided 10% level using the better of a standard log‐rank (SLR) and weighted log‐rank (WLR; G[rho = 0, gamma = 1]) test. Secondary end points included objective response, duration of response, investigator‐assessed progression‐free survival, and toxicity.RESULTSOf 166 patients enrolled, 136 were eligible (69 RP; 67 SOC). OS was significantly improved with RP (hazard ratio [80% CI]: 0.69 [0.51 to 0.92]; SLR one‐sided P =.05; WLR one‐sided P =.15). The median (80% CI) OS was 14.5 (13.9 to 16.1) months for RP and 11.6 (9.9 to 13.0) months for SOC. OS benefit for RP was seen in most subgroups. Investigator‐assessed progression‐free survival (hazard ratio [80% CI]: 0.86 [0.66 to 1.14]; one‐sided SLR, P =.25 and.14 for WLR) and response rates (22% RP v 28% SOC, one‐sided P =.19) were similar between arms. Grade ≥ 3 treatment‐related adverse events occurred in 42% of patients in the RP group and 60% on SOC.CONCLUSIONThis randomized phase II trial demonstrated significantly improved OS with RP compared with SOC in patients with advanced NSCLC previously treated with ICI and chemotherapy. The safety was consistent with known toxicities of both drugs. These data warrant further evaluation.},

abstract = {Background: Studies have shown that aggressive treatment of non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with oligometastatic disease improves the overall survival (OS) compared to a palliative approach and some immunotherapy checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti‐programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD‐L1), anti‐programmed cell death protein 1 (PD‐1), and T‐Lymphocyte‐associated antigen 4 (CTLA‐4) inhibitors are now part of the standard of care for advanced NSCLC. However, the prognostic impact of PD‐L1 expression in the oligometastatic setting remains unknown. Methods: Patients with oligometastatic NSCLC were identified from the patient database of the Centre hospitalier de l’Université de Montréal (CHUM). “Oligometastatic disease” definition chosen is one synchronous metastasis based on the M1b staging of the eight IASLC (The International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer) Classification (within sixth months of diagnosis) or up to three cerebral metastasis based on the methodology of the previous major phase II randomized study of Gomez et al. We compared the OS between patients receiving aggressive treatment at both metastatic and primary sites (Group A) and patients receiving non‐aggressive treatment (Group B). Subgroup analysis was performed using tumor PD‐L1 expression. Results: Among 643 metastatic NSCLC patients, we identified 67 patients with oligometastasis (10%). Median follow‐up was 13.3 months. Twenty‐nine patients (43%) received radical treatment at metastatic and primary sites (Group A), and 38 patients (57%) received non‐aggressive treatment (Group B). The median OS (mOS) of Group A was significantly longer than for Group B (26 months vs. 5 months, p = 0.0001). Median progression‐free survival (mPFS) of Group A was superior than Group B (17.5 months vs. 3.4 months, p = 0.0001). This difference was still significant when controlled for primary tumor staging: stage I (p = 0.316), stage II (p = 0.024), and stage III (p = 0.001). In the cohort of patients who were not treated with PD‐L1 inhibitors, PD‐L1 expression negatively correlated with mOS. Conclusions: Aggressive treatments of oligometastatic NSCLC significantly improve mOS and mPFS compared to a more palliative approach. PD‐L1 expression is a negative prognostic factor which suggests a possible role for immunotherapy in this setting.},

Patients and Methods: A total of 103 patients with advanced NSCLC who received ICIs plus chemotherapy at our hospital from January 2019 to July 2021 were retrospectively enrolled. Results: Patients with BM tended to have shorter progression‐free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) compared with patients without BM. The maximum size of BM and the proportion of patients with symptomatic BM were greater among patients who received brain radiotherapy before chemoimmunotherapy. However, patients who received prior brain radiotherapy had better PFS and OS compared with patients who did not receive prior brain radiotherapy. Conclusion: Patients who received prior brain radiotherapy experienced a superior therapeutic benefit of ICIs plus chemotherapy, including those with larger and more symptomatic BM.},

Here we describe treatment patterns and outcomes for pts according to brain metastases. Methods: Treatment‐naïve pts (WHO PS 0/1) with ES‐SCLC received 4 cycles of D 1500 mg + EP q3w followed by maintenance D 1500 mg q4w until disease progression (PD) or up to 6 cycles of EP q3w and optional prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI; investigator's discretion).

Results: At baseline, 28 (10.4%) of 268 pts in the D + EP arm and 27 (10.0%) of 269 pts in the EP arm had known brain metastases; of these, only 3 pts (∼11% of those with baseline brain metastases) in each arm received radiotherapy (RT) to the brain prior to study entry. D + EP consistently improved OS vs EP in pts with or without known brain metastases at baseline (HR 0.69 [95% CI 0.35‐1.31] and 0.74 [0.59‐0.93], respectively); PFS was also consistently improved with D + EP regardless of the presence or not of baseline brain metastases (HR 0.73 [0.42‐1.29] and 0.78 [0.64‐0.95]). Among pts without known brain metastases at baseline, similar proportions developed new brain metastases at first PD in the D + EP (20/240; 8.3%) and EP arms (23/242; 9.5%), despite 19 (7.9%) pts in the EP arm having received PCI.

abstract = {Background: Serum tumor markers carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), cancer antigen 125 (CA125), cytokeratin 19 fragment (CYFRA21‐1) and squamous‐cell carcinoma‐related antigen (SCC‐Ag) are routinely used for monitoring the response to chemotherapy or targeted therapy in advanced‐stage non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), however their role in immunotherapy remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate whether dynamics of these serum markers were associated with the efficacy and prognosis of Chinese late‐stage NSCLC patients treated with programmed cell death‐1/programmed cell death ligand‐1 (PD‐1/PD‐L1) inhibitors. Methods: We initiated a longitudinal prospective study on advanced NSCLC patients treated with PD‐1/PD‐L1 inhibitors in Chinese PLA general hospital (Beijing, China). Blood samples of baseline and after 6 weeks' treatment were collected. CT scan were used by all patients to evaluate treatment efficacy according to RECIST 1.1. Serum tumor markers levels were measured with an electrochemical luminescence for SCC‐Ag and with a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay for serum CEA, CA125, and CYFRA21‐1. At least 20% decreases of the biomarkers from baseline were considered as meaningful improvements after 6 weeks of treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Optimization‐based method was used to balance baseline covariates between different groups. Associations between serum tumor biomarker improvements and objective response rate (ORR), progression‐free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were analyzed. Results: A total of 308 Chinese patients with advanced NSCLC were enrolled in the study. After balancing baseline covariates, patients with meaningful improvements in <2 out of 4 biomarkers (CEA, CA125, CYFRA21‐1, and SCC‐Ag) was ended up with lower ORR (0.08 vs. 0.35, p < 0.001), shorten PFS (median: 5.4 vs. 12.5 months, p < 0.001), and OS (median: 11.7 vs. 25.6 months, p < 0.001) in the total population. Subgroup analysis of patients with adenocarcinoma revealed that patients with meaningful improvements in <2 out of 4 biomarkers had significant lower ORR (0.06 vs. 0.36, p < 0.001), shorten PFS (median: 4.1 vs. 11.9 months, p < 0.001), and OS (median: 11.9 vs. 24.2 months, p < 0.001). So as in patients with squamous cell carcinoma, meaningful improvements in at least 2 out of 4 biomarkers were linked to better ORR (0.42 vs. 0.08, p = 0.014), longer PFS (median: 13.1 vs. 5.6 months, p = 0.001), and OS (median: 25.6 vs. 10.9 months, p = 0.06). Conclusions: The dynamic change of CEA, CA125, CYFRA21‐1, and SCC‐Ag from baseline have prognostic value for late‐stage NSCLC patients treated with PD‐1/PD‐L1 inhibitors. Decrease of associated biomarkers serum levels were associated with favorable clinical outcomes.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Immunotherapy extensively treats advanced non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Although immunotherapy is generally better tolerated than chemotherapy, it can cause multiple immune‐related adverse events (irAEs) involving multiple organs. Checkpoint inhibitor‐related pneumonitis (CIP) is a relatively uncommon irAE that, in severe cases, can be fatal. Potential risk factors for the occurrence of CIP are currently poorly understood. This study sought to develop a novel scoring system for predicting the risk of CIP based on a nomogram model. METHODS: We retrospectively collected advanced NSCLC patients who received immunotherapy at our institution between January 1, 2018, and December 30, 2021. All patients who met the criteria were randomly divided into the training set and testing set (in a ratio of 7:3), and cases fulfilling the CIP diagnostic criteria were screened. The patients' baseline clinical characteristics, laboratory tests, imaging, and treatment information were extracted from the electronic medical records. The risk factors associated with the occurrence of CIP were identified based on the results of logistic regression analysis on the training set, and a nomogram prediction model was developed. The discrimination and prediction accuracy of the model was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, the concordance index (C‐index), and the calibration curve. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was used to evaluate the clinical applicability of the model. RESULTS: The training set comprised 526 (CIP: 42 cases), and the testing set comprised 226 (CIP: 18 cases) patients, respectively. In the training set, the final multivariate regression analysis revealed that age (p = 0.014; odds ratio [OR] = 1.056; 95% Confidence Interval [CI] =1.011‐1.102), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (p = 0.002; OR = 6.170; 95% CI = 1.943‐19.590), history of prior radiotherapy (p < 0.001; OR = 4.005; 95% CI = 1.920‐8.355), baseline white blood cell count (WBC) (p < 0.001; OR = 1.604; 95% CI = 1.250‐2.059), and baseline absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) (p = 0.034; OR = 0.288; 95% CI = 0.091‐0.909) were identified as independent risk factors for the occurrence of CIP. A prediction nomogram model was developed based on these five parameters. The area under the ROC curve and C‐index of the prediction model in the training set and testing set were 0.787 (95% CI: 0.716‐0.857) and 0.874 (95% CI: 0.792‐0.957), respectively. The calibration curves are in good agreement. The DCA curves indicate that the model has good clinical utility. CONCLUSION: We developed a nomogram model that proved to be a good assistant tool for predicting the risk of CIP in advanced NSCLC. This model has the potential power to help clinicians in making treatment decisions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nivolumab has shown improved survival in the treatment of advanced non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC) previously treated with chemotherapy. We assessed the safety and activity of combination nivolumab plus ipilimumab as first‐line therapy for NSCLC. METHODS: The open‐label, phase 1, multicohort study (CheckMate 012) cohorts reported here were enrolled at eight US academic centres. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with histologically or cytologically confirmed recurrent stage IIIb or stage IV, chemotherapy‐naive NSCLC. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) by an interactive voice response system to receive nivolumab 1 mg/kg every 2 weeks plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks, nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 12 weeks, or nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicities, or withdrawal of consent. Data from the latter two cohorts, which were considered potentially suitable for further clinical development, are presented in this report; data from the other cohort (as well as several earlier cohorts) are described in the appendix. The primary outcome was safety and tolerability, assessed in all treated patients. This ongoing study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01454102. INTERPRETATION: In NSCLC, first‐line nivolumab plus ipilimumab had a tolerable safety profile and showed encouraging clinical activity characterised by a high response rate and durable response. To our knowledge, the results of this study are the first suggestion of improved benefit compared with anti‐PD‐1 monotherapy in patients with NSCLC, supporting further assessment of this combination in a phase 3 study. FUNDING: Bristol‐Myers Squibb. FINDINGS: Between May 15, 2014, and March 25, 2015, 78 patients were randomly assigned to receive nivolumab every 2 weeks plus ipilimumab every 12 weeks (n=38) or nivolumab every 2 weeks plus ipilimumab every 6 weeks (n=40). One patient in the ipilimumab every‐6‐weeks cohort was excluded before treatment; therefore 77 patients actually received treatment (38 in the ipilimumab every‐12‐weeks cohort; 39 in the ipilimumab every‐6‐weeks cohort). At data cut‐off on Jan 7, 2016, 29 (76%) patients in the ipilimumab every‐12‐weeks cohort and 32 (82%) in the ipilimumab every‐6‐weeks cohort had discontinued treatment. Grade 3‐4 treatment‐related adverse events occurred in 14 (37%) patients in the ipilimumab every‐12‐weeks cohort and 13 (33%) patients in the every‐6‐weeks cohort; the most commonly reported grade 3 or 4 treatment‐related adverse events were increased lipase (three [8%] and no patients), pneumonitis (two [5%] and one [3%] patients), adrenal insufficiency (one [3%] and two [5%] patients), and colitis (one [3%] and two [5%] patients). Treatment‐related serious adverse events were reported in 12 (32%) patients in the ipilimumab every‐12‐weeks cohort and 11 (28%) patients in the every‐6‐weeks cohort. Treatment‐related adverse events (any grade) prompted treatment discontinuation in four (11%) patients in the every‐12‐weeks cohort and five (13%) patients in the every‐6‐weeks cohort. No treatment‐related deaths occurred. Confirmed objective responses were achieved in 18 (47% [95% CI 31‐64]) patients in the ipilimumab every‐12‐weeks cohort and 15 (38% [95% CI 23‐55]) patients in the ipilimumab every‐6‐weeks cohort; median duration of response was not reached in either cohort, with median follow‐up times of 12·8 months (IQR 9·3‐15·5) in the ipilimumab every‐12‐weeks cohort and 11·8 months (6·7‐15·9) in the ipilimumab every‐6‐weeks cohort. In patients with PD‐L1 of 1% or greater, confirmed objective responses were achieved in 12 (57%) of 21 patients in the ipilimumab every‐12‐weeks cohort and 13 (57%) of 23 patients in the ipilimumab every‐6‐weeks cohort.},

abstract = {Mycobacterial preparations have been used with limited success against cancer apart from superficial bladder cancer. Recently, a therapeutic vaccine derived from Mycobacterium vaccae has been given to patients with prostate cancer and melanoma indicating a possible beneficial effect on disease activity in such patients. We have recently initiated a series of randomized studies to test the feasibility and toxicity of combining a preparation of heat‐killed Mycobacterium vaccae (designated SRL172) with a multidrug chemotherapy regimen to treat patients with inoperable non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and mesothelioma. 28 evaluable patients with previously untreated symptomatic NSCLC and mesothelioma were randomized to receive either 3 weekly intravenous combination chemotherapy alone, or chemotherapy given with monthly intra‐dermal injections of SRL172. Safety and tolerability were scored by common toxicity criteria and efficacy was evaluated by survival of patients and by tumour response assessed by CT scanning. The toxicity of chemotherapy was similar in the two groups. SRL172 caused mild inflammation at the injection site. In the group of patients randomized to receive chemotherapy combined with SRL172, there was a trend towards improved response rate (54% vs. 33%) with more patients in the combined arm receiving radical surgery and radiotherapy, improved median survival (9.7 months vs. 7.5 months) and improved 1 year survival (42% vs. 18%). SRL172 appeared to improve sleep (P = 0.08) and improved appetite (P = 0.01). There was no detectable change in serum cytokine levels for gamma‐interferon and TNF‐alpha before and after treatment. In patients with NSCLC and mesothelioma, there may be a beneficial interaction when chemotherapy is administered in combination with SRL172. Confirmation of this effect and further investigation is underway in a randomized phase III trial and in laboratory models.},

abstract = {Background: While the introduction of checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs) as standard of care treatment for various tumor types has led to considerable improvements in clinical outcome, the majority of patients still fail to respond. Preclinical data suggest that stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) could work synergistically with CPIs by acting as an in situ cancer vaccine, thus potentially increasing response rates and prolonging disease control. Though SBRT administered concurrently with CPIs has been shown to be safe, evidence of its efficacy from large randomized trials is still lacking. The aim of this multicenter randomized phase II trial is to assess whether SBRT administered concurrently with CPIs could prolong progression‐free survival as compared to standard of care in patients with advanced solid tumors. Methods/design: Ninety‐eight patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to receive CPI treatment combined with SBRT (Arm A) or CPI monotherapy (Arm B). Randomization will be stratified according to tumor histology (melanoma, renal, urothelial, head and neck squamous cell or non‐small cell lung carcinoma) and disease burden (? or > 3 cancer lesions). The recommended SBRT dose is 24Gy in 3 fractions, which will be administered to a maximum of 3 lesions and is to be completed prior to the second or third CPI cycle (depending on CPI treatment schedule). The study?s primary endpoint is progression‐free survival as per iRECIST. Secondary endpoints include overall survival, objective response, local control, quality of life and toxicity. Translational analyses will be performed using blood, fecal and tissue samples. Discussion: The CHEERS trial will provide further insights into the clinical and immunological impact of SBRT when combined with CPIs in patients with advanced solid tumors. Furthermore, study results will inform the design of future immuno‐radiotherapy trials. Trial registration: Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT03511391. Registered 17 April 2018.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a fatal disease with poor prognosis. A membrane‐bound form of Hsp70 (mHsp70) which is selectively expressed on high‐risk tumors serves as a target for mHsp70‐targeting natural killer (NK) cells. Patients with advanced mHsp70‐positive NSCLC may therefore benefit from a therapeutic intervention involving mHsp70‐targeting NK cells. The randomized phase II clinical trial (EudraCT2008‐002130‐30) explores tolerability and efficacy of ex vivo‐activated NK cells in patients with NSCLC after radiochemotherapy (RCT). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with unresectable, mHsp70‐positive NSCLC (stage IIIa/b) received 4 cycles of autologous NK cells activated ex vivo with TKD/IL2 [interventional arm (INT)] after RCT (60‐70 Gy, platinum‐based chemotherapy) or RCT alone [control arm (CTRL)]. The primary objective was progression‐free survival (PFS), and secondary objectives were the assessment of quality of life (QoL, QLQ‐LC13), toxicity, and immunobiological responses. RESULTS: The NK‐cell therapy after RCT was well tolerated, and no differences in QoL parameters between the two study arms were detected. Estimated 1‐year probabilities for PFS were 67% [95% confidence interval (CI), 19%‐90%] for the INT arm and 33% (95% CI, 5%‐68%) for the CTRL arm (P = 0.36, 1‐sided log‐rank test). Clinical responses in the INT group were associated with an increase in the prevalence of activated NK cells in their peripheral blood. CONCLUSIONS: Ex vivo TKD/IL2‐activated, autologous NK cells are well tolerated and deliver positive clinical responses in patients with advanced NSCLC after RCT.},

abstract = {Background: Carboplatin/etoposide + atezolizumab (IMpower133) is now 1L standard‐of‐care for patients with extensive disease small cell lung cancer (ED SCLC). Thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) after induction chemotherapy has been shown to increase 2‐year overall survival rates. Alongside, evidence for synergistic immunostimulatory effects of radiotherapy and immunotherapy (IO) is increasing. Combining these results, the TREASURE trial attempted to improve response to chemo‐IO by adding TRT. Methods: The phase II, multicenter TREASURE trial (NCT04462276) randomized patients with ED SCLC, ECOG≤1, and response to IMpower133 induction to receive atezolizumab maintenance therapy (1200mg, Q3W, until progression/toxicity) either with TRT (10x30 Gy, arm A) or without TRT (arm B). Safety interim analysis was planned once 23 patients in arm A had been observed for 3 months after TRT ended, with the safety signal being ≥2 patients with grade ≥3 pneumonitis. Results: In 04/22, interim safety analysis showed only 1/23 patients with grade ≥3 pneumonitis in arm A. However, routine safety monitoring committee (SMC) review in 08/22 identified a potential imbalance in grade 5 severe adverse events (SAEs) between the arms (n=5 in A, n=1 in B), and thus recruitment was paused. Data review 3 months later revealed more SAEs in arm A (28 any, 16 grade 3/4, 6 grade 5) vs. B (9 any, 4 grade 3/4, 1 grade 5). Along with evaluation of further parameters, this prompted Coordinating Investigator and SMC to permanently stop recruitment. Of note, neither differences in clinical measures of comorbidity nor functional status were detected between arms. At the time of recruitment stop (12/22), 68 patients were included in the trial (n=34 in each arm). Conclusions: Although TRT‐IO combinations have not been the source of safety concerns in other trials, it was associated with more SAEs in TREASURE. SAE analysis did not indicate any new safety signal of atezolizumab or TRT. Observed SAEs were either known adverse effects or confounded, and not clearly tied to either IO or TRT. Thus, the factors underlying this unexpected outcome remain to be identified and will be focus of the final analysis of this trial. Clinical trial identification: NCT04462276.

abstract = {Background: MAURIS is a multicenter, open label, single arm, phase IIIb trial conducted in 25 Italian centers, that evaluates the safety and efficacy of ATZ + Cb‐Eto in patients with newly diagnosed ES‐SCLC, according to the new standard of care from the pivotal trial IMpower133. Patients (pts) with ECOG PS2, untreated asymptomatic brain metastases (BM) were eligible for this study and consolidative and palliative radiotherapy was also allowed. An interim analysis (IA) has been conducted roughly one year from the end of enrolment with a median follow‐up of 10.5 months. Methods: Patients enrolled in the study received ATZ 1200 mg + Cb‐Eto every 3 weeks for 4–6 cycles in the induction phase, followed by ATZ maintenance every 3 weeks up to disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or clinical deterioration. The primary endpoints were the incidence of serious adverse events (SAE) and immune‐mediated AEs (imAE). The secondary endpoints were 1 year survival, overall survival (OS), progression‐free survival (PFS) and overall response rate (ORR). Results: 154 patients (95 males, mean age 65.1 years, 6 pts with PS2, 19 pts with BM) were treated. At data cut‐off 28 oct 2021, 139 pts (90.3%) discontinued the treatment: 97 pts (63.0%) due to progressive disease, 17 pts (11.0%) due to AE. Safety data related to the induction phase and efficacy data at data cut‐off were analysed overall and by the number of induction cycles. [Formula presented] Conclusions: In this interim analysis, safety data observed in the induction phase seem consistent with IMpower133 results considering a patient population closer to clinical practice both for baseline patient characteristics and co‐treatments allowed. In terms of efficacy data, we found that PFS and ORR were also aligned. Survival data in relation to the number of cycles in the induction phase, according to the investigator’s choice, might reflect a biased population and they should be confirmed.

abstract = {Cervical cancer is common cancer type, with global high incidence which ranks it on fourth place in women worldwide. Its' mortality is especially high in underdeveloped regions in the world, such as east Africa, eastern Asia and South America. Nevertheless, because cervical cancer affects generally younger women, many in reproductive years, in comparison to other solid tumor types, it represents big socioeconomic burden to societies globally. Therapy options in different stages of this cancer have not changed significantly for decades now, reflecting low investment in research and development of new drugs and treatment strategies for this disease. So, cervical cancer patients truly represent underserved population in terms of cancer care. Cancer immunotherapy has made major impact on treatment of many patients with solid tumors. Immunotherapy offered a new hope especially for melanoma, kidney cancer, non‐small cell lung cancer patients, but for many others also. Fortunately, cervical cancer represents a field of rapid and extensive immunotherapy research due to its' genuine ability to produce immunogenic response. It is well known that almost all of the cervical cancers are caused by infection with oncogenic types of human papiloma virus (HPV), and the virus particles themselves, especially E6 and E7 component represent potent targets for immune reaction. So far, research in this area branches in several directions: use of checkpoint inhibitors, cancer vaccines, immune modulators, T‐cell therapy, and therapy with dendritic cells. Pembrolizumab, an anti PD‐1 antibody, is first immunotherapy drug approved for treatment of recurrent/ metastatic cervical cancer whit positive expression of PD‐L1 based on the results of KEYNOTE‐158 study. In pretreated patients pembrolizumab elicited a response rate (RR) of 14.6% and a median overall survival (OS) of 11 months. This drug is still not approved in Europe for this indication. Results of treatment of cervical cancer with other checkpoint inhibitors, such as nivolumab, ipilimumab, and combinations of anti PD‐1 and anti CTLA‐4 antibodies have been reported also. The combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab in women with squamous cell cancer of the cervix showed great response that was better than with existing chemotherapy regimens. The response rate in second‐line metastatic disease was 36% with an OS that was not reached (>13.9 months). While prophylactic vaccines have made a major change in prevention of cervical precancerous lesions, therapeutic vaccines active in developed disease are still in research. Two phase II studies on Lysteria monocytogenes based treatments in cervical cancer have been reported. This gram‐positive bacteria serves as a vector for T fusion protein that includes a truncated fragment of listeriolysin O (tLLO) which is fused to human HPV‐16 E7 and elicits potent cell immunity. The therapeutic compound made this way via bioengineering is called Axalimogene filolisbac or ADXS11‐001. In these studies, in pretreated cervical cancer patients, investigators observed a median survival ranging from 6.2 to 8.3 months, and 12‐months OS in range of 35‐38%. Currently, there are numerous ongoing studies with combination regimens, such as chemotherapyimmunotherapy combinations, similarly to proven protocols used in other tumor types. Of special interest are ongoing studies in locally advanced cervical cancer that test concomitant whole pelvic radiotherapy with cisplatin and checkpoint inhibitors. Besides PD‐1 and CTLA‐4 inhibition, immunotherapy against other targets, such as TIM‐3, LAG‐3, VISTA, and TIGIT, is in progress also. A novel approach using tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) is being tested in HPV induced cancers, including cervical cancer. In cervical cancer TILs are connected with better clinical outcomes, and in limited number of patients infusion of specially engineered and expanded TILs induced promising treatment response. Altogether, immunotherapy has shown promising activity in cervical cancer. So far, we still lack results of big randomized phase III studies that are currently recruiting patients. If they show positive results, treatment paradigm in cervical cancer could be changed across broad spectrum of the disease, from locoregional to advanced stages. Proper patient selection for every modality is of paramount interest and novel biomarkers beyond PD‐L1 have been explored.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sotorasib is a specific, irreversible inhibitor of the GTPase protein, KRASG12C. We compared the efficacy and safety of sotorasib with a standard‐of‐care treatment in patients with non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with the KRASG12C mutation who had been previously treated with other anticancer drugs. METHODS: We conducted a randomised, open‐label phase 3 trial at 148 centres in 22 countries. We recruited patients aged at least 18 years with KRASG12C‐mutated advanced NSCLC, who progressed after previous platinum‐based chemotherapy and a PD‐1 or PD‐L1 inhibitor. Key exclusion criteria included new or progressing untreated brain lesions or symptomatic brain lesions, previously identified oncogenic driver mutation other than KRASG12C for which an approved therapy is available (eg EGFR or ALK), previous treatment with docetaxel (neoadjuvant or adjuvant docetaxel was allowed if the tumour did not progress within 6 months after the therapy was terminated), previous treatment with a direct KRASG12C inhibitor, systemic anticancer therapy within 28 days of study day 1, and therapeutic or palliative radiation therapy within 2 weeks of treatment initiation. We randomly assigned (1:1) patients to oral sotorasib (960 mg once daily) or intravenous docetaxel (75 mg/m2 once every 3 weeks) in an open‐label manner using interactive response technology. Randomisation was stratified by number of previous lines of therapy in advanced disease (1 vs 2 vs >2), ethnicity (Asian vs non‐Asian), and history of CNS metastases (present or absent). Treatment continued until an independent central confirmation of disease progression, intolerance, initiation of another anticancer therapy, withdrawal of consent, or death, whichever occurred first. The primary endpoint was progression‐free survival, which was assessed by a blinded, independent central review in the intention‐to‐treat population. Safety was assessed in all treated patients. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04303780, and is active but no longer recruiting. INTERPRETATION: Sotorasib significantly increased progression‐free survival and had a more favourable safety profile, compared with docetaxel, in patients with advanced NSCLC with the KRASG12C mutation and who had been previously treated with other anticancer drugs. FUNDING: Amgen. FINDINGS: Between June 4, 2020, and April 26, 2021, 345 patients were randomly assigned to receive sotorasib (n=171 [50%]) or docetaxel (n=174 [50%]). 169 (99%) patients in the sotorasib group and 151 (87%) in the docetaxel group received at least one dose. After a median follow‐up of 17·7 months (IQR 16·4‐20·1), the study met its primary endpoint of a statistically significant increase in the progression‐free survival for sotorasib, compared with docetaxel (median progression‐free survival 5·6 months [95% CI 4·3‐7·8] vs 4·5 months [3·0‐5·7]; hazard ratio 0·66 [0·51‐0·86]; p=0·0017). Sotorasib was well tolerated, with fewer grade 3 or worse (n=56 [33%] vs n=61 [40%]) and serious treatment‐related adverse events compared with docetaxel (n=18 [11%] vs n=34 [23%]). For sotorasib, the most common treatment‐related adverse events of grade 3 or worse were diarrhoea (n= 20 [12%]), alanine aminotransferase increase (n=13 [8%]), and aspartate aminotransferase increase (n=9 [5%]). For docetaxel, the most common treatment‐related adverse events of grade 3 or worse were neutropenia (n=13 [9%]), fatigue (n=9 [6%]), and febrile neutropenia (n=8 [5%]).},

abstract = {Introduction: CASPIAN is a Phase 3, randomized, open‐label, global study evaluating 1L platinum‐etoposide (EP)±durvalumab(D)±tremeli‐mumab(T) for patients (pts) with ES‐SCLC. D+EP demonstrated statistical signifcant (stat sig) improvement in overall survival (OS) vs EP (HR 0.73 [95% CI 0.59‐0.91]; p=0.0047; DCO 03/2019). Here we present ef‐cacy & safety results for D+T+EP vs EP (DCO 01/2020). Methods: ES‐SCLC pts (WHO PS 0/1) were randomized 1:1:1 to D(1500mg)+T(75mg)+EP(3qw), D+EP or EP. Investigator's choice carbo‐/cisplatin allowed in all arms (stratifcation at randomization). Pts received 4 cycles of D±T+EP, followed by maintenance D (q4w) until disease progression. In the D+T+EP arm, pts received an additional dose of T post E P. In the EP arm, pts received up to 6 cycles of EP & prophylactic cranial irradiation per investigator's choice. The primary endpoint was OS. Secondary endpoints included progression‐free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), safety & tolerability. Final OS analysis of the ITT population was planned at 80% maturity for D+T+EP vs E P. Statistics: Kaplan‐Meier method & stratifed log‐rank test. Results: 268 pts were randomized to D+EP, D+T+EP & EP, respectively; baseline characteristics were balanced across arms. The median (m) follow‐up was 25.1 mo at 82% maturity. D+EP continued to demonstrate improvement in OS vs EP [HR 0.75 (95% CI 0.62‐0.91; nominal p=0.0032)]; mOS 12.9 vs 10.5 mo, respectively. 22.2% of pts were alive at 2y with D+EP vs 14.4% of pts with EP. D+T+EP numerically improved OS vs E P, w/o stat sig per prespecifed stat plan: HR 0.82 [95% CI 0.68‐1.00; p=0.0451 (p≤0.0418 required for stat sig)]; mOS was 10.4 mo & 23.4% of pts were alive at 2y. PFS & ORR remained improved with D+EP vs EP. For D+T+EP vs EP ORR (58.4% vs 58.0%) & mPFS (4.9 mo vs 5.4 mo) were similar, but 12‐mo PFS rate was numerically higher (16.9% vs 5.3%); PFS HR 0.84 (95% CI 0.70‐1.01). In the D+EP, D+T+EP & EP arms, respectively, incidences of all‐cause AEs of Grade 3/4 were 62.3%, 70.3% & 62.8%; AEs leading to discontinuation 10.2%, 21.4% & 9.4%; & AEs leading to death 4.9%, 10.2% & 5.6%. Conclusion: D+EP still demonstrate improved OS, supporting this regimen as new standard of care for 1L ES‐SCLC with fexible platinum choice. No additional beneft of D+T+EP was observed in this pt population. Safety fndings remained consistent with known safety profles of all agents. Clinical trial information: NCT03043872.},

abstract = {Background: Preliminary results from trial CheckMate 032, targeting two distinct inhibitory immune checkpoints combining nivolumab, an anti‐PD1 IgG1 monoclonal antibody and ipilimumab, an anti‐CTLA4 IgG1 monoclonal antibody, demonstrate very promising 31% objective response rate (ORR) and 48% one‐year overall survival (OS) in pre‐treated advanced SCLC. This treatment option will be explored in a consolidation setting after curative‐intent chemotherapy, chest radiotherapy (RT) and prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) for LD‐SCLC. Trial design: STIMULI is an open‐label, randomised, two‐arm, phase II clinical trial. Inclusion is restricted to stage I‐IIIB untreated LD‐SCLC patients ( pts) with adequate organ and pulmonary function, and no history of auto‐immune disease. Hyper‐ or conventionally fractionated chest RT is administered concomitantly to 4 cycles of Cis‐/ carboplatin plus etoposide, followed by PCI. After completion of this standard treatment, non‐progressing pts are randomised 1:1 to consolidation (induction and maintenance) or observation. Induction consists of four 3‐week cycles of ipilimumab 3mg/kg plus nivolumab 1mg/kg, and is followed by maximally 12 months of nivolumab 240mg every 2 weeks. OS and progression‐free survival (PFS) are co‐primary endpoints. ORR, time to treatment failure and tolerability are secondary endpoints. A total of 325 pts are expected to be enrolled in the standard treatment phase, in order for 260 pts to be randomised, with a target hazard ratio of .70 for OS and .57 for PFS. The overall one‐sided significance level of .05 is split to .04 for OS and .01 for PFS, with power 78% for OS and 80% for PFS. A safety evaluation for pneumonitis will take place after the first 30 patients reach the 12 weeks follow‐up on the experimental arm. Safety will be monitored by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee every 3 months. Translational research will be done on formalin‐fixed, paraffin‐embedded tumour tissue, PBMCs, whole blood and serum samples at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois in Lausanne, Switzerland. Up to April 2016, 7 pts have been randomised, and enrolment is ongoing.},

abstract = {Background: SCLC is an aggressive disease with poor survival. Despite initial response to chemoradiation, most patients with LS‐SCLC relapse. Between 85‐96% of patients with SCLC have tumor expression of Delta‐like ligand 3 (DLL3), a Notch ligand aberrantly expressed on the surface of SCLC cells with minimal expression in healthy cells, making DLL3 an attractive therapeutic target. In the phase II DeLLphi‐301 study, tarlatamab, a bispecific T cell engager (BiTE®) immunotherapy targeting DLL3 and T cell co‐receptor CD3, demonstrated antitumor activity and a manageable safety profile in patients with previously treated extensive stage‐SCLC: 40% objective response and a 6‐month overall survival (OS) rate (KM estimate) of 73% at 10 mg Q2W (NEJM 2023;389:2063). Trial design: DeLLphi‐306 is a randomized (1:1), double‐blind, placebo‐controlled Phase 3 trial examining tarlatamab (10 mg Q2W in 28‐day cycles) clinical activity and safety in ≈ 400 patients with LS‐SCLC following concurrent chemoradiation. Key patient inclusion criteria include age ≥ 18 years, histologically/cytologically confirmed LS‐SCLC, completion of platinum‐based chemotherapy with concurrent radiotherapy without progression, ECOG PS ≤ 1, chemoradiotherapy‐attributed toxicities resolved to grade ≤ 1 excluding alopecia, and life expectancy ≥ 12 weeks. Key exclusion criteria include transformed NSCLC; interstitial lung disease; active pneumonitis; non‐concurrent chemotherapy and thoracic radiotherapy during chemoradiation; prior DLL3 pathway‐selective inhibitor therapy; and history of severe/life‐threatening events from immune‐mediated therapy. Primary endpoint is progression‐free survival (PFS) per blinded independent central review (RECIST 1.1) with OS as a key secondary endpoint. Additional secondary endpoints include investigator‐assessed PFS, objective response, disease control, duration of response, time to progression, pharmacokinetics, tarlatamab immunogenicity, and safety/tolerability.

abstract = {Proton therapy is an attractive option for the treatment of lung cancer patients due to the physical properties of proton beams. Proton therapy allows a focused delivery of radiation at the Bragg peak, with very steep decline of the radiation dose beyond the target volume. These properties offer the possibility to 1) reduce toxicity by reducing the integral dose and the dose to adjacent normal tissues and 2) escalate the dose to the target in some patients. In this talk, I will summarise briefly the physics/radiobiology of protons and the need for adaptation. I will also discuss the rationale for the use of protons in patients with lung cancer, including reduction in integral dose, cardiac toxicity and reduction in haematological toxicity. The clinical trial evidence supporting the use of protons will be presented in early stage and locally advanced non‐small cell lung cancer as well as in small‐cell lung cancer. Finally I will discuss future research directions, including preclinical and drug‐proton combination research, ongoing clinical trials, the model based‐approach and the need for biomarkers.

abstract = {Background: In locally advanced non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the addition of chemotherapy to radiotherapy and consolidation with durvalumab leads to a significant increase in overall survival and represents the most profound innovation of the last decade. Objectives: Analysis of new possibilities for the state‐of‐the‐art implementation of definitive radiochemotherapy concepts. Materials and methods: Evaluation of prospective and randomised studies regarding improvements in treatment outcomes. Results: Overall survival benefit of consolidating checkpoint inhibitor therapy after combined radiochemotherapy with durvalumab is 43% (95% confidence interval 38–47%) versus 33% (27–40%) in the placebo group in an updated analysis of the PACIFIC trial for 5‑year survival; stratified hazard ratio for death is 0.72 (95% CI 0.59–0.89, p= 0.0025). In the dose escalation studies, increased pulmonary and oesophageal side effects were observed, so no immediate clinical benefit could be derived from the increase in local efficacy. Improved imaging before and during therapy and optimised possibilities of dose application, especially by using intensity‐modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), allow selective sparing of healthy structures, which increases the ability to safely intensify radiotherapy also in connection with new immunomodulatory substance combinations. Conclusion: The integration of immunotherapy, the stringent use of fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG‐PET) in staging and radiation planning, the widespread use of highly conformal radiation techniques (IMRT; volumetric modulated arc therapy, VMAT) and the consistent application of image‐guided radiotherapy have led to significant improvements in treatment outcomes.},

In this setting theprogrammed death 1/ligand 1 (PD‐1/‐L1) were targeted with nivolumab (IgG4) in advancedsquamous and nonsquamous NSCLC leading to an increase of the 1‐year OS rate ofapproximately 10‐15% in both histologies. Nivolumab, pembrolizumab and atezolizumab arenow considered a standard of care in 2nd line advanced NSCLC and in 1st line forpembrolizumab but but prognosis still remains poor in advanced NSCLC. Overall survival(OS) of patients with advanced (stage III/IV) NSCLC remains limited with a median OS of12.2 months in non‐squamous NSCLC and 9.2 months in squamous NSCLC if anti‐PD1 alone. Itis of around 16 months if pembrolizumab is combined with chemotherapy.Preclinical data indicates that anti‐tumor efficacy is increased when anti‐PD‐1/‐L1 arecombined with irradiation (IR). Radiotherapy alone can elicit tumor cell death which canincrease tumor antigen in the blood stream, favoring recognition by the immune system andits activation against tumor cells outside of the radiation field (="abscopal effect").IR may also reverse acquired resistance to PD‐1 blockade immunotherapy by limiting T‐cellexhaustion.Because of these preclinical and clinical data several studies analysing the combinationof IR and anti‐PD1 in NSCLC are ongoing. Among them, two studies are testing theadministration of IR and nivolumab in stage III NSCLC: the NCT02768558 phase III trial(RTOG), and the NCT02434081 phase II trial (ETOP). Antonia et al [2017] tested the use ofanti‐PD‐L1 after chemoradiotherapy in unresectable stage III NSCLC. Median time todistant metastasis was increased (23.2 months vs. 14.6 months, p<0.001). An increase ofOS is consequently expected.However, no study involving concurrent RT and pembrolizumab combined with chemotherapy inadvanced NSCLC is ongoing, which is the purpose of the present study, NIRVANA‐Lung.},

abstract = {Background: Adding PD‐L1/PD‐1 inhibitors to chemotherapy (chemo) has demonstrated efficacy and been approved for advanced squamous non‐small cell lung cancer (sqNSCLC) as first‐line therapy. However, the prognosis remains unsatisfactory. High expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is prevalent in sqNSCLC. This study aimed to compare the efficacy of HLX07, a novel humanised anti‐EGFR antibody, plus serplulimab (anti‐PD‐1 antibody) ± chemo versus serplulimab plus chemo as first‐line option for advanced sqNSCLC. Methods: This randomised, multicentre phase 2 study consisted of 4 parts and assessed different combinations of HLX07 (at various doses), serplulimab, and chemo. Part 3 explored the preliminary efficacy of the three‐drug combination and is presented below. Patients with stage IIIB/IIIC or IV sqNSCLC that could not be treated with surgery or radiation therapy and had not received prior systemic therapy were enrolled and randomised 1:1 to receive intravenous HLX07 at 800 mg (group A) or 1000 mg (group B), combined with serplulimab (300 mg) and chemo (carboplatin and nab‐paclitaxel), Q3W. The primary endpoints were IRRC‐assessed ORR and PFS per RECIST 1.1. Results: As of 27 June 2023, 12 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to group A (n=6) and group B (n=6) in part 3. The median age was 64 years. 11 (91.7%) patients were male. 10 (83.3%) patients had stage IV disease. With a median follow‐up of 3.5 months, investigator‐assessed unconfirmed ORR per RECIST 1.1 was 83.3% (95% CI 35.9–99.6) in group A and 66.7% (95% CI 22.3–95.7) in group B. Disease control rate was 100.0% (95% CI 54.1–100.0) in both groups. 2 (33.3%) patients in group A and 1 (16.7%) in group B had serious treatment‐emergent adverse events (TEAEs). 1 (16.7%) patient in group B reported a grade 3 adverse event of special interest (AESI) with dermatitis acneiform; no grade 4–5 AESI occurred. No TEAE leading to death was reported. Conclusions: First‐line HLX07 plus serplulimab and chemo conferred encouraging antitumour efficacy with a manageable safety profile in patients with advanced sqNSCLC and warrants further investigation.

abstract = {Colorectal Cancer (CRC) is a common malignant tumor. Its incidence ranks third and secondamong men and women respectively, and its mortality rate ranks third. Data from the WorldHealth Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) in 2020 showthat more than 930,000 patients died due to CRC. Since 2000, the incidence and mortalityof colorectal cancer have been steadily increasing in China. The National Cancer Centerof China (NCC) reported that there were approximately 408,000 new cases of CRC in Chinain 2016, and approximately 196,000 deaths. Most of the patients are in the mid‐to‐latestage when diagnosed, and about 35% of them are in the advanced stage. They have nochance of radical surgery and can only receive palliative care.In the early days when leucovorin (LV) and 5‐fluorouracil (5‐FU) were used as the maintreatment options for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), the efficacy waspoor, and the median overall survival (OS) of patients was only for 8‐12 months. Sincethe introduction of effective cytotoxic drugs such as irinotecan and oxaliplatin in 2000,the combination regimens FOLFOX (5‐FU/LV + oxaliplatin) and FOLFIRI (5‐FU/LV +irinotecan) have become first‐line systemic Standard protocol in treatment. The use ofbiologics targeting key pathways in the development and progression of mCRC, such asepidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF)‐related pathways, further extends the survival of mCRC patients.In the latest version of CSCO colorectal cancer diagnosis and treatment guidelines, themain recommended first‐line treatments are FOLFOX/FOLFIRI┬▒bevacizumab or cetuximab (bothRAS and BRAF are wild‐type), FOLFOX/FOLFIRI┬▒bevacizumab (RAS or BRAF mutant).PD‐1 plays an important role in suppressing immune responses and promoting immunetolerance by inhibiting the activity of T cells, allowing cancer cells to evade immunesurveillance. Cells in the tumor microenvironment often express PD‐1 and PD‐L1.Consistent with the inducible expression of PD‐L1 by tumor cells, activated CD8+ effectorT cells often express PD‐1, indicating that tumor cells are resistant to adaptive immuneresponses. PD‐L1 has been found to be expressed in many types of cancer, includingmelanoma, lung cancer, urothelial cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Its expressioncan also be induced by various factors such as radiation, which helps cancer cells evadeimmune regulation. Blocking the PD‐1/PD‐L1 interaction has been shown to treat a varietyof cancers. Clinical studies have proven that anti‐PD‐1 and anti‐PD‐L1 monoclonalantibodies can induce long‐lasting anti‐tumor activity against a variety of tumors.Anti‐PD‐1 monoclonal antibodies have been approved for the treatment of melanoma,non‐small cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer, head and neck squamous cellcarcinoma, urothelial carcinoma, entities with high microsatellite instability ormismatch repair deficiency and colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, esophageal cancer,cervical cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), renal cellcarcinoma, endometrial cancer, bladder cancer, primary mediastinal large B‐cell lymphoma( PMBCL) and classic Hodgkin lymphoma. A large number of clinical studies of anti‐PD‐1antibodies are currently underway, some as monotherapy and some in combination withmultiple drugs.This study is an open‐label, single‐arm, phase II clinical trial. The study inclusioncriteria are patients with unresectable mCRC aged 18‐75 years old and histologicallyconfirmed by multidisciplinary treatment (MDT). The patients have RAS gene mutations andare confirmed to be MSS. state. All patients received treatment with sintilimab combinedwith CapeOx and bevacizumab. After the disease achieved complete response (CR)/partialresponse (PR)/stable disease (SD), maintenance treatment was performed. The main purposeof the study Endpoints include objective response rate (ORR) as assessed by RECIST v1.1and adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0. The secondary endpoint is progression‐freesurvival (PFS).This study mainly aims to explore the effectiveness of chemotherapy and bevacizumabinduction therapy combined with PD‐1 monoclonal antibody in the first‐line treatment ofMSS‐type initial unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer. The second is its safety andtolerability.},

abstract = {This will be a phase 1, open‐label, multicenter, safety study of nab‐paclitaxel based chemotherapy regimens administered prior to and/or in combination with nivolumab in Pancreatic Cancer, NSCLC and mBC. This is a six arm study assessing two treatment arms per tumor‐type/indication: ‐ Adenocarcinoma of the pancreas with 1 prior systemic chemotherapy (Arm A, Part 1 only); and subsequently no prior chemotherapy, surgery or radiation therapy for locally advanced or metastatic disease (Arm A, Part 2 and Arm B): ‐ Panc Ca Arm A: nab‐paclitaxel with nivolumab starting at Cycle 1. ‐ Panc Ca Arm B: nab‐paclitaxel/gemcitabine with nivolumab starting at Cycle 1. ‐ Stage IIIB or IV NSCLC with no prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease and who are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation: ‐ NSCLC Arm C: nab‐paclitaxel/carboplatin x 4 cycles with nivolumab starting Cycle 1 and continuing as monotherapy starting at Cycle 5. ‐ NSCLC Arm D: nab‐paclitaxel/carboplatin x 4 cycles with nivolumab starting Cycle 3 and continuing as monotherapy starting at Cycle 5 ‐ HER2‐negative recurrent metastatic breast cancer after one prior regimen for mBC, including an anthracycline unless clinically contraindicated: ‐ mBC Arm E: weekly nab‐paclitaxel with nivolumab starting at Cycle 3. ‐ mBC Arm F: q3weekly nab‐paclitaxel with nivolumab starting at Cycle 3. Enrollment in each treatment arm will be conducted in two sequential parts to allow for the evaluation of the DLT in Part 1 prior to expanding the treatment arm in Part 2. Part 1: Part 1 will assess the Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) of the nivolumab dose in combination with nab‐paclitaxel regimens in each treatment arm. Subjects who meet the entry criteria will be assigned to the respective treatment arm based on tumor type and indication as outlined above. Panc Ca Arms A and B, as well as NSCLC Arms C and D, will enroll sequentially in Part 1. The safety of nivolumab in combination with nabpaclitaxel, without gemcitabine, will first be assessed in Arm A in subjects with one prior systemic chemotherapy regimen for locally advanced or metastatic disease. Panc Ca Arm B may begin enrolling subjects in Part 1, if Panc Ca Arm A is deemed safe, based on DLT criteria. Similarly, NSCLC Arm D will begin to enroll in Part 1 after NSCLC Arm C is deemed safe to expand in Part 2. However, Arm D may be initiated, even if Arm C is not to proceed for Part 2, if the totality of data from Arm C and emerging data from this and other studies in NSCLC with nivolumab in combination with platinum chemotherapy doublets support the decision. Unlike the Panc Ca and NSCLC arms, the two mBC arms (Arms E and F) will be initiated simultaneously. Subjects will be assigned randomly between treatment arms of a tumor type/indication whenever both treatment arms are enrolling. An IRT system will be used to ensure the central random allocation of subjects. Part 2: Treatment arms deemed safe within each tumor‐type/indication may be expanded using the RP2D with an additional approximately 14 subjects (to attain a total of 20 nivolumab‐treated subjects) to further assess safety and tolerability, as well as explore anti‐tumor activity of the proposed regimens. Since the primary population for the pancreas arms is in subjects with no prior chemotherapy, surgery or radiation therapy, enrollment in Part 2 for Panc Ca Arm A will continue until 20 such subjects have been treated with at least one dose of nivolumab. Additionally, in Parts 1 and 2 overall, each mBC Arm (E and F) will enroll a minimum of 9 subjects with triple‐ negative breast cancer (TNBC), treated at the RP2D. For both Part 1 and 2, subjects may continue to receive their assigned treatment regimen until Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 defined progression or until unacceptable toxicity. However, the chemotherapy doublet will only be given for 4 cycles in the NSCLC arms; thereafter, nivolumab will be given as monotherapy.},

abstract = {Background: In pts with locally advanced, unresectable, stage III NSCLC, cCRT is associated with better survival than radiotherapy (RT) alone, but 5‐y survival remains poor. Immunotherapies targeting PD‐1/PD‐L1 may be synergistic with cCRT, improving outcomes. Tislelizumab, an anti‐PD‐1 antibody, showed clinical activity/tolerability in solid tumors, including NSCLC. RATIONALE 001 is a phase III, randomized, doubleblind, placebo‐controlled trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of first‐line tislelizumab+ cCRT in pts with locally advanced, unresectable, stage III NSCLC. Trial design: RATIONALE 001 aims to answer important scientific questions by employing a 3‐arm study design (840 pts randomized 1:1:1) to evaluate whether the timing of giving tislelizumab earlier upfront with cCRT in addition to consolidation will improve outcomes rather than giving the anti‐PD‐1 as consolidation only (Table). Both tislelizumab approaches (Arms 1 and 2) will each be compared to a global standard of care, cCRT alone. Chemotherapy will be investigator's choice (cisplatin + etoposide or carboplatin + paclitaxel). RT will be given in 2Gy fractions (target dose of 60 Gy). Key eligibility: Locally advanced, unresectable, stage III NSCLC; stage III confirmed by FDG‐PET and brain imaging; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ≤ 1; and no prior anti‐PD‐1/PD‐L1 therapy. PD‐L1 expression assessment is not required prior to randomization. Primary endpoint: Progressionfree survival. Secondary endpoints include overall survival (OS), OS at 24 mo, objective response rate, and safety. Blood and tumor biomarkers, including PD‐L1 expression and tumor mutational burden, will be evaluated for correlations with clinical benefit. (Table Presented) .},

abstract = {1. Background 1.1 Radiotherapy in lung cancer Non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer‐related death in both men and women [1]. In stage IV disease platinum‐based chemotherapy yields a median overall survival (OS) of 8‐10 months [2]. When diagnosed, more than 50% of the patients have distant metastases. Forty percent have signs or symptoms originating from the thorax: dyspnoea, cough, haemoptysis, recurrent pneumonia or chest pain [3]. Palliative thoracic radiotherapy can relieve symptoms originating from intra‐thoracic malignancy and improves quality of life (QoL) in approximately one third of patients [4]. It is increasingly used in daily clinical practice as an alternative to chemotherapy in patients without local symptoms with the purpose of prolonging life and avoiding local thoracic symptoms. In addition, palliative radiotherapy is used to relieve symptoms before initiating systemic treatment (chemotherapy, targeted agents, immune therapy, etc). In this latter case, it is important not to delay the systemic treatment unnecessary with long schedules of radiotherapy. An optimal radiotherapy regimen will thus palliate symptoms with minimal toxicity and consider the patient's time investment, as well as be compatible with any additional treatments given. In a recent retrospective study of 159 consecutive Danish NSCLC patients who received palliative thoracic radiotherapy (2010‐11) median survival was 4.2 months. One third of the patients died within two months and 22% within 30 days [5]. This further underlines the importance of not subjecting patients to prolonged, toxic treatments in their final year of life. A recent Cochrane review [6] found that there was no consistent evidence to support that longer, more fractionated radiotherapy regimens gave better or more durable palliation than shorter regimens. Furthermore, there was no significant survival advantage associated with longer regimens with higher biological radiation doses. The most common acute toxicity is oesophagitis. It is often not technically possible to avoid high dose exposure to the oesophagus because of the target localization in proximity to the mediastinum. Radiation‐induced oesophagitis is most often a reversible condition. However, it compromises swallowing due to pain, causes weight loss and deterioration of the performance state (PS) and QoL at a vulnerable time for the patient, and it may impact the possibility of receiving further anti‐neoplastic treatment. The Cochrane review found that up to 50% of patients receiving palliative thoracic radiotherapy reported severe oesophagitis. The studies differed widely in terms of physician‐ or patient self‐assessment, timing, and the method used, and no overall judgement could be made. The review concluded that toxicity was comparable between different radiotherapy regimens. However, recording and reporting of early toxicity was lacking in the included studies. This absence of early toxicity data means that the current evidence is insufficient for clinical decision making in this patient group. 2. Study design The patients will be invited to participate in the study prior to initiation of palliative radiotherapy. After signing informed consent the patients will be randomized 1:1 between two different radiotherapy dose fractionations: 30 Gy/10 F or 20 Gy/4 F. Physicians and patients will not be blinded to the randomization. 2.1 Systemic therapy Patients can receive chemotherapy, immunotherapy and targeted therapy during radiotherapy. 2.2 Study sample size and time frame According to the Danish Lung Cancer Registry, 50% of the 4700 lung cancer patients diagnosed yearly are in advanced stage. Of these, one third is supposed to benefit from palliative thoracic radiotherapy and of these, 400 patients ( 50%) are expected to be enrolled on the trial each year. Since 1184 consecutive patients are required (see chapter 7) the study is expected to enrol patients over a 3‐year period. Given the declared support of all Danish radiotherapy centres, this is considered a realistic time frame. Following study closure, 3 weeks of follow‐up after radiotherapy initiation will be allowed for all patients, at which point data will be collected for primary analysis. Further analysis will be performed 1 and 3 years after the last patient is enrolled. Data will be kept in databases 15 years after the last patient is included. 3. Radiotherapy treatment planning 3.1 Target and organs at risk The gross tumour volume (GTV) is defined by the referring oncologist based on a planning CT scan, and if available, a diagnostic PET/CT scan. The oncologist will note in the CRF if the GTV fully or only partially encompass all active malignant disease in the thorax. The clinical target volume (CTV) is identical to the GTV, and thus not delineated. Spinal cord or spinal canal, total lung, heart and the oesophagus are delineated for all patients based on the guidelines in [5,6]. The heart is cranially limited defined by the division of truncus pulmonalis. The oesophagus is delineated from cartilago criocoideum to the gastro‐oesophageal junction. 3.2 Dose planning Patients are treated with conformal treatment plans, conventional or intensity‐modulated. 4. Treatment verification and quality assurance 4.1 Verification of treatment position Daily imaging must be performed and used for daily correction of treatment position. 5. Participants Patients with lung cancer stage III‐IV not suitable for curative treatment, being referred for palliative radiotherapy either alone or in addition to systemic treatment. 5.1 Evaluations during treatment and follow up 5.1.1 Expected side effects Palliative RT comes with a risk of side‐effects including fatigue, pain and soreness in the throat and chest, reddening of the skin in the irradiated area and dry cough and dyspnoea. 5.1.2 Scoring of symptoms and QoL Symptom scores on oesophagitis, cough, pain, dyspnoea, bronchopulmonary haemorrhage, performance status and QoL will be registered at baseline, end of treatment, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 8‐10 weeks and 6 months after radiotherapy completion. If the patient has symptoms which need clinical assessment, the patient will get an appointment with a physician. All complication (side effects) will be evaluated according to the NCI‐CTCAE v 5.0 during all follow‐up visits or calls [7]. See appendix C for an overview of the CTCAE v 5.0. Table 6.1 shows the evaluation plan for the trial. Symptom scores on oesophagitis, cough, pain, dyspnoea, bronchopulmonary haemorrhage, and assessment of performance status will be registered during the patient on‐site visit at baseline, end of treatment, 8‐10 weeks after treatment and 6 months after treatment completion. At 2 weeks and 3 weeks, symptom scores will be registered by a phone call. Questionnaires for registration of QoL will be filled in on‐site by the patient at baseline, end of treatment, 8‐10 weeks after completion of treatment and 6 months after completion of treatment. In addition, two questionnaires for registration of QoL to be filled in 2 weeks and 3 weeks after completion of treatment will be handed out at end of treatment. During the phone calls at 2 weeks and 3 weeks, the patient will be reminded to fill in the questionnaire. The questionnaires will be collected at the on‐site visit at 8‐10 weeks after treatment. One or both phonecalls at 2 weeks and 3 weeks may be substituted by on site visits. After the end of the study‐specified visit, patients will be seen every 3rd month according to the guidelines by the Danish Health Authorities. Evaluation of toxicity will be performed at every occasion. End of study is 3 years after commencement of radiotherapy. 5.2 Quality of Life To examine the participants' quality of life (QoL) during follow up, they will be asked to fill in a QoL questionnaire. The EuroQoL 5D (EQ‐5D‐5L) questionnaire will be used. 6. Statistical considerations and planned data analyses 6.1 Sample size calculation for primary endpoint ‐ acute oesophagitis The primary study endpoint is reduction in early oesophageal toxicity, as assessed two weeks after completion of radiotherapy. The investigators assume that 50% of patients who receive the standard treatment (30 Gy in 10 fractions) will experience grade 2 or worse oesophagitis, compared to their baseline prior to treatment. A reduction in acute toxicity of 10%‐point with the experimental treatment (odds ratio between arms of 0.67) will be clinically meaningful and will justify a change of practice for this patient group. This corresponds to an expected 40% rate of acute oesophagitis in the experimental arm. With 90% power and a 2‐sided type 1 error rate of 5%, 1184 patients will be required (assuming 1:1 allocations between treatment arms, and incorporating a 10% loss to follow‐up). There are some clinical indications that oesophageal‐related toxicity will mainly be seen in patients with centrally located tumours (where palliative radiotherapy results in irradiation of mediastinal structures). These patients make up approximately two thirds of the palliative radiotherapy patient population. An incidence of oesophagitis of 70% in these patients (and 10% in patients with peripheral tumours) is consistent with the observed overall toxicity rate. Enrolling 790 patients with central tumours in the study will result in >95% power to detect a 15%‐point reduction of toxicity in this subgroup, from 70% to 55% (consistent with an overall reduction of 10%, assuming very limited effect in patients with peripheral tumours). Alternatively, there will be nearly 80% power to detect a 10%‐point toxicity reduction in the central tumour subgroup. Any such subgroup analyses will be completely exploratory. All sample size and power calculations for the primary endpoint are based on two‐group chi‐squared tests (continuity corrected) of equal proportions. 6.2 Non‐inferiority of overall survival Current best evidence indicates that overall survival should not be different with shorter compared to longer palliative treatment regimens, although the literature is not conclusive. The proposed study will have the power to test for non‐inferiority of the short (experimental) treatment arm compared to the standard treatment: Assuming a median OS of 4.2 months, inclusion of 1184 patients over 3 years (with one year of additional follow‐up) will give approximately 90% power to test that median OS in the experimental arm is at most 3 weeks shorter than in the standard arm (one‐sided significance level of 95%). Power calculations for overall survival are based on Cox's proportional hazards model. 6.3 Planned data analyses All analyses will be conducted on an intention to treat (ITT) basis. The primary endpoint analysis will take place once all enrolled patients have reached the primary endpoint assessment (2 weeks after completion of radiotherapy). A multivariate logistic regression model will be used to compare rates of grade 2+ acute oesophagitis in the two treatment arms, adjusted for stratification factors. Robustness of the primary endpoint to the timing of oesophagitis assessment will be examined in secondary analyses, comparing the two arms with respect to oesophagitis rates at 3 weeks after end of therapy as well as oesophagitis rates at 4 weeks after the start of therapy (two weeks after end of therapy in the standard arm and three weeks after end of therapy in the experimental arm). Significance testing will be two‐sided, with a 95% significance level. Analysis of secondary endpoints will depend on the follow‐up required for each endpoint; with most endpoints (QoL, response assessment) available at the time of primary analysis, and initial analysis of overall survival conducted one year after randomisation of the final patient. 6.4 Randomization ‐ Patients are stratified prior to randomization by treatment institution, performance status 0/1 versus 2, and histology (small cell carcinoma vs squamos cell carcinoma vs non‐squamos cell carcinoma). ‐ Patients will be randomized 1:1 between the two different radiotherapy dose fractionations 7. Complications All complication (side effects) will be evaluated according to the NCI‐CTCAE v 5.0 during all followup visits. 8.

abstract = {Background: First‐line durvalumab plus etoposide with either cisplatin or carboplatin (platinum–etoposide) showed a significant improvement in overall survival versus platinum–etoposide alone in patients with extensive‐stage small‐cell lung cancer (ES‐SCLC) in the CASPIAN study. Here we report updated results, including the primary analysis for overall survival with durvalumab plus tremelimumab plus platinum–etoposide versus platinum–etoposide alone. Methods: CASPIAN is an ongoing, open‐label, sponsor‐blind, randomised, controlled phase 3 trial at 209 cancer treatment centres in 23 countries worldwide. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older (20 years in Japan) and had treatment‐naive, histologically or cytologically documented ES‐SCLC, with a WHO performance status of 0 or 1. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) in blocks of six, stratified by planned platinum, using an interactive voice‐response or web‐response system to receive intravenous durvalumab plus tremelimumab plus platinum–etoposide, durvalumab plus platinum–etoposide, or platinum–etoposide alone. In all groups, patients received etoposide 80–100 mg/m2 on days 1–3 of each cycle with investigator's choice of either carboplatin area under the curve 5–6 mg/mL/min or cisplatin 75–80 mg/m2 on day 1 of each cycle. Patients in the platinum–etoposide group received up to six cycles of platinum–etoposide every 3 weeks and optional prophylactic cranial irradiation (investigator's discretion). Patients in the immunotherapy groups received four cycles of platinum–etoposide plus durvalumab 1500 mg with or without tremelimumab 75 mg every 3 weeks followed by maintenance durvalumab 1500 mg every 4 weeks. The two primary endpoints were overall survival for durvalumab plus platinum–etoposide versus platinum–etoposide and for durvalumab plus tremelimumab plus platinum–etoposide versus platinum–etoposide in the intention‐to‐treat population. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03043872. Findings: Between March 27, 2017, and May 29, 2018, 972 patients were screened and 805 were randomly assigned (268 to durvalumab plus tremelimumab plus platinum–etoposide, 268 to durvalumab plus platinum–etoposide, and 269 to platinum–etoposide). As of Jan 27, 2020, the median follow‐up was 25·1 months (IQR 22·3–27·9). Durvalumab plus tremelimumab plus platinum–etoposide was not associated with a significant improvement in overall survival versus platinum–etoposide (hazard ratio [HR] 0·82 [95% CI 0·68–1·00]; p=0·045); median overall survival was 10·4 months (95% CI 9·6–12·0) versus 10·5 months (9·3–11·2). Durvalumab plus platinum–etoposide showed sustained improvement in overall survival versus platinum–etoposide (HR 0·75 [95% CI 0·62–0·91]; nominal p=0·0032); median overall survival was 12·9 months (95% CI 11·3–14·7) versus 10·5 months (9·3–11·2). The most common any‐cause grade 3 or worse adverse events were neutropenia (85 [32%] of 266 patients in the durvalumab plus tremelimumab plus platinum–etoposide group, 64 [24%] of 265 patients in the durvalumab plus platinum–etoposide group, and 88 [33%] of 266 patients in the platinum–etoposide group) and anaemia (34 [13%], 24 [9%], and 48 [18%]). Any‐cause serious adverse events were reported in 121 (45%) patients in the durvalumab plus tremelimumab plus platinum–etoposide group, 85 (32%) in the durvalumab plus platinum–etoposide group, and 97 (36%) in the platinum–etoposide group. Treatment‐related deaths occurred in 12 (5%) patients in the durvalumab plus tremelimumab plus platinum–etoposide group (death, febrile neutropenia, and pulmonary embolism [n=2 each]; enterocolitis, general physical health deterioration and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, pneumonia, pneumonitis and hepatitis, respiratory failure, and sudden death [n=1 each]), six (2%) patients in the durvalumab plus platinum–etoposide group (cardiac arrest, dehydration, hepatotoxicity, interstitial lung disease, pancytopenia, and sepsis [n=1 each]), and two (1%) in the platinum–etoposide group (pancytopenia and thrombocytopenia [n=1 each]). Interpretation: First‐line durvalumab plus platinum–etoposide showed sustained overall survival improvement versus platinum–etoposide but the addition of tremelimumab to durvalumab plus platinum–etoposide did not significantly improve outcomes versus platinum–etoposide. These results support the use of durvalumab plus platinum–etoposide as a new standard of care for the first‐line treatment of ES‐SCLC. Funding: AstraZeneca.},

abstract = {Backround: Lung cancer is most frequently diagnosed cancer and leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Concomitant chemoradiotherapy is the treatment of choice for patients with non‐small cell lung cancer, who are in good condition, with stage IIIB, IIIC and selected patients with earlier stages of the disease that is inoperable. Although randomised clinical trials have proved the benefit of this approach, in everyday clinical practice, due to multiple reasons, it is still underutilised. Based on survival benefit with consolidation immunotherapy with durvalumab after concomitant chemoradiotherapy, this has become new standard of treatment in western countries. The prerequisite for optimal results of this new strategy, that is still not reimbursed in Croatia, is properly conducted chemoradiotherapy part of the treatment. Objectives: Our goal was to examine the efficacy and safety of concurrent chemoradiotherapy as primary therapy in patients with non‐small cell lung cancer stages I‐III, treated at the Department of Oncology, University Hospital of Split from 2011. till 2018. Patients and metods: In a retrospective study conducted at Department of Oncology and Radiotherapy, University Hospital of Split, the comprehensive demographic and clinical data was collected on a total of 84 patients, treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy as a primary treatment, in period between 2011., when we introduced 3D conformal radiotherapy, and 2018. Study protocol was approved by University Hospital of Split Ethics' Committee. Results: The median age of patients was 61 years, 75% being male. The most common histological types where squamous cell carcinoma (56%) and adenocarcinoma (32%). The median dose of applied radiotherapy was 55 Gy, with 30% of patients receiving 60 Gy or more. All patients got concurrent platinum and etoposide (PE) chemotherapy, five or three‐day regimens, and 69% got both cycles.The median follow‐up time of our patients was 15 months. Objective response rate was 69%. The median progression free survival (PFS) was 9 months (95% CI: 7.27‐12.57) and median overall survival (OS) was 17 months (95% CI: 13.47‐27.43). The treatment was relatively well tolerated. The most common acute toxicity was leukopenia, observed in 65% of patients. Radiation esophagitis, with a 39% occurrence, was the most common acute toxicity of grade 1 and 2, while the most common grade 3 and 4 toxicity was neutropenia (38% of patients). Conclusion: This retrospective analysis on treatment outcomes of patients with locally advanced lung cancer treated with concomitant chemoradiotherapy showed comparable results in clinical efficacy and toxicity with older randomised clinical trials that positioned the role of concurrent chemoradiotherapy in this disease, but are slightly inferior to the most recent trials. Possible explanations are: retrospective nature of the study, treatment in every day setting that differs significantly from clinical trials conditions, mainly by inclusion of patients with worse demographic and clinical characteristics. Nevertheless, these results are the first one reported on treatment outcomes of this approach in Croatia, and are again pointing out on importance of real multidisciplinary approach to lung cancer patients.},

abstract = {Purpose: The landmark randomized trial on chest irradiation in extensive disease small cell lung cancer (CREST) demonstrated that consolidative thoracic radiation therapy (cTRT) improved overall (OS) and progression‐free survival (PFS) after initial chemotherapy (chemo) in extensive‐stage small cell lung cancer, with potentially increased benefit in women compared with men. It is unknown whether similar findings would apply after chemoimmunotherapy became the standard first‐line treatment. In this analysis, we report national practice patterns and survival outcomes of cTRT according to patient sex. Methods and Materials: We included patients from de‐identified electronic health record‐derived database diagnosed with stage IV small cell lung cancer (2014‐2021) who completed 4 to 6 cycles of first‐line systemic therapy (platinum‐doublet chemotherapy or chemoimmunotherapy). We evaluated OS and PFS using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression with receipt of cTRT as an independent variable and stratified by sex. As a sensitivity analysis, we weighted the models by the inverse probability of receiving cTRT. Results: A total of 1227 patients were included (850 chemotherapy, 377 chemoimmunotherapy). There were no statistically significant differences in baseline characteristics between patients who did and did not receive cTRT. Among women, cTRT was associated with superior OS (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.67; 95% CI, 0.52‐0.87) and PFS (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.49‐0.82) compared with those not receiving cTRT. Conversely, no OS or PFS benefit with cTRT was observed in men (OS HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.80‐1.31; PFS HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.85‐1.47). Findings were similar in weighted analyses. Conclusions: The survival efficacy of cTRT may be moderated by sex, with female patients appearing more likely to benefit than male patients. These findings reflect sex‐based survival trends with similar effect sizes to those observed in the CREST trial. Although the underpinnings of this association need to be elucidated, stratification by sex should be considered for randomized‐controlled trials studying cTRT in extensive‐stage small cell lung cancer.},

abstract = {This multicenter phase‐II trial aimed to investigate the efficacy, safety, and predictive biomarkers of toripalimab plus chemotherapy as second‐line treatment in patients with EGFR‐mutant‐advanced NSCLC. Patients who failed from first‐line EGFR‐TKIs and did not harbor T790M mutation were enrolled. Toripalimab plus carboplatin and pemetrexed were administrated every three weeks for up to six cycles, followed by the maintenance of toripalimab and pemetrexed. The primary endpoint was objective‐response rate (ORR). Integrated biomarker analysis of PD‐L1 expression, tumor mutational burden (TMB), CD8 + tumor‐infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) density, whole‐exome, and transcriptome sequencing on tumor biopsies were also conducted. Forty patients were enrolled with an overall ORR of 50.0% and disease‐control rate (DCR) of 87.5%. The median progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival were 7.0 and 23.5 months, respectively. The most common treatment‐related adverse effects were leukopenia, neutropenia, anemia, ALT/AST elevation, and nausea. Biomarker analysis showed that none of PD‐L1 expression, TMB level, and CD8 + TIL density could serve as a predictive biomarker. Integrated analysis of whole‐exome and transcriptome sequencing data revealed that patients with DSPP mutation had a decreased M2 macrophage infiltration and associated with longer PFS than those of wild type. Toripalimab plus chemotherapy showed a promising anti‐tumor activity with acceptable safety profiles as the second‐line setting in patients with EGFR‐mutant NSCLC. DSPP mutation might serve as a potential biomarker for this combination. A phase‐III trial to compare toripalimab versus placebo in combination with chemotherapy in this setting is ongoing (NCT03924050).},

A safety analysis specific to the cisplatin + etoposide component of the cCRT + tislelizumab combination is planned. All sites must pass a radiation quality assurance review process. The primary endpoint is PFS. Secondary endpoints include ORR, OS, OS at 24 months, and safety. As an exploratory endpoint, blood and tumor biomarkers will be assessed for correlations with clinical benefit. With a one‐sided α of 1.25%, a total of 580 PFS events are required to allow ≈ 90% power to detect a HR for progression or death of 0.7 for either pairwise comparison (Arm 1 vs Arm 3 or Arm 2 vs Arm 3). Key eligibility criteria are locally advanced, unresectable, stage III NSCLC; FDG‐PET and brain imaging confirmation of stage III status; no prior treatment; and ECOG PS ≤ 1. PD‐L1 expression assessment is not required prior to randomization. EudraCT number 2018‐001132‐22.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A previous pilot study from our group suggested that: (1) adoptive immunotherapy (A1) with tumor‐infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) and recombinant interleukin‐2 (rIL‐2) may be applied with safety to more than 80% of the patients who had surgery for Stage III nonsmall cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC); and (2) AI could be useful in patients with locally advanced disease. The present randomized study was planned to assess the efficacy of AI in the postoperative treatment of Stage II, IIIa, or IIIb NSCLC: METHODS: TIL were expanded in vitro from tissue samples obtained from the surgically removed specimens of 131 patients. Eighteen cultures yielded no growth of TIL. The remaining 113 patients were stratified according to disease stage and randomized to receive AI or standard chemoradiotherapy. TIL were infused intravenously 6 to 8 weeks after surgery, rIL‐2 was administered subcutaneously at escalating doses for 2 weeks, and then at reduced doses for 2 weeks and then for 2 to 3 months. RESULTS: Three‐year survival was significantly better (P < 0.05) for patients who underwent AI than for controls. AI was of no benefit to patients with Stage II NSCLC, potentially useful to patients with Stage IIIa NSCLC (P = 0.06), and significantly advantageous to patients with Stage IIIb (T4) NSCLC (P < 0.01). For patients with Stage III NSCLC, local relapse (but not distant relapse) was significantly reduced following AI (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: AI should be considered when designing future adjuvant therapy protocols for the treatment of NSCLC:},

The gut microbiome has been shown able to modulate the antitumor efficacy of immunotherapeutic agents in pre‐clinical models, demonstrating that patients can be stratified into responders and nonresponders to immunotherapy on the basis of their microbiota composition. Fecal microbiota transplants have demonstrated to improve the efficacy of immunotherapy in animal models. In this study, investigators will include 20 stage III/V non‐small cell lung cancer naïve for PD/PD L‐1 inhibitors that require treatment in monotherapy or combined with chemotherapy as consolidation strategy after concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy (stage III), upfront treatment (stage IV patients with PDL1 status > 50%) or as second line strategy for those patients with advanced disease who progressed to chemotherapy alone. The participants will be randomized to receive either fecal microbiota capsules from 3 donors selected based on the fecal abundance of bacterial taxa shown to correlate with a greater response to immunotherapy or not, in combination with the PDL/PDL1 agent. The primary outcome will be safety. The secondary outcomes will be treatment response (iRECIST criteria). Investigators will also examine engraftment of donor's microbiota on host microbiota using Illumina DNA shotgun sequencing, changes in the bacterial metabolism using metaproteomics, and in the plasma metabolite fingerprint by untargeted mass spectrometry in bacterial and plasma samples, and changes in peripheral immune cells subpopulations and antitumoral immunity. MORELIA could improve the prognosis of a lung cancer in a subset of patients with limited therapeutic options and inform on how to exploit host‐microbiota interactions with tailored fecal microbiota transplantation to boost the clinical response to immunotherapy in advanced cancer.},

abstract = {Concomitant chemoradiotherapy is currently the most widely accepted standard of care for patients with locoregionally advanced NSCLC. Induction chemotherapy represents an evidence‐based alternative and is a particular attractive prior to surgery in patients with marginally resectable disease.1 Over the past two decades, the regimens of cisplatin and etoposide and carboplatin and paclitaxel with concurrent radiotherapy, respectively have been most widely used, with cisplatin and vinorelbine with radiotherapy as possible alternative. More recently interest in the cisplatin/pemetrexed/radiotherapy combination has gained interest based on the superior toxicity and efficacy profile of this regimen in the stage IV setting for patients with non‐squamous cell malignancies.2 In addition, it is possible to administer this combination of drugs at systemic doses together with radiotherapy.3 In the randomized phase III PROCLAIM study, this regimen was directly compared with etoposide and cisplatin. The goal of this trial was to establish superiority of this regimen. The trial was closed prior to full enrollment with approximately 300 patients per arm evaluated, due to futility for superiority. Median survival for both study groups was very similar at 26.8 and 25.0 months, respectively and better than statistically assumed.4 Additional chemoradiotherapy regiments of current interest include the addition of the PARP inhibitor veliparib to chemoradiotherapy as recently presented. 5 Over the last decade, systemic therapy for patients with metastatic lung cancer has been transformed through the use of tumor mutation analyses and targeted therapies as well as the emergence of immune‐oncology. However, application of these strategies to the stage III setting has been slow and no definitive data exist currently to support these strategies in the curative intent setting. The addition of cetuximab to chemoradiotherapy did not result in a survival benefit in RTOG 0612.6 There are, however several ongoing trials that will be described, including RTOG 1306‐Alliance 31101. In this trial patients with EGFR mutation or an alk translocation are randomized to either induction chemotherapy with the appropriate targeted agent (erlotinib and crizotinib, respectively) followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy or concurrent chemoradiotherapy alone. This trial is actively accruing patients. Regarding immune‐ oncology, a trial evaluating a liposome‐based MUC vaccine (tecemotide) has been completed. MUC1 is a mucinous glycoprotein that is overexpressed and aberrantly glycosylated in NSCLC and a vaccination strategy was supported by preclinical studies as well as clinical data in a stage III subgroup analysis of an earlier exploratory trial. Butts et al7 reported on a randomized trial in which patients completing locoregional sequential or concurrent therapy were randomized to placebo versus tecemotide vaccination therapy reporting a trend for improved overall survival that was statistically significant in the subset analysis of patients receiving concurrent radiotherapy as their primary therapy. Further investigations of this agent however were halted following emergence of additional negative data from a Japanese phase II trial that remains unpublished. Regarding PD‐1 or PDL1 inhibitors, trials have recently been activated investigating the addition of such agents in the consolidation setting following primary treatment of patients with unresectable SCLC. For example, in the 'Pacific' trial patients are randomized in a 2‐1 fashion to durvalumab for up to 12 months or placebo. In the Alliance, a trial looking at induction chemotherapy with atezolizumab is currently in the process of activation. Here patients will receive induction chemotherapy with atezolizumab for up to four cycles followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy and additional adjuvant immune therapy. These strategies are well supported by preclinical data showing irradiation upregulating PD1 expression on myeloid and tumor cells and synergistic amplification of radiation antitumor effects by PD‐L1 blockade.8 Updated information on these trials and relevant preclinical data will be presented.},

abstract = {The longstanding dogma that local therapies do not apply for metastatic cancers like non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) because “the horse is out of the barn” is predicated on two concepts that do not necessarily apply to a subset of patients with oligometastatic NSCLC. First, local ablative therapy (LAT) is assumed to be futile when the pace of the cancer is defined by a diffuse disease process. Second, LAT is presumed to incur challenging toxicities that limit its applicability. For patients with oligometastatic NSCLC, these limitations do not apply, making LATs a standard treatment strategy. Patients with a solitary brain or adrenal “precocious metastasis” have long been recognized as having a potential for prolonged survival after definitive treatment of both the primary tumor and the (usually) resected metastatic focus, with approximately 25% remaining alive and without evidence of recurrent cancer years later (1). This underscores that metastatic disease is not a binary variable that necessarily connotes a diffuse process and highlights that effective local therapy can render some patients in the spectrum of metastatic disease durably cancer‐free. Patients with advanced NSCLC who are now strong candidates to benefit from LAT include those with oligometastatic disease, whether as their “de novo” presentation, induced oligometastatic disease after highly effective systemic therapy, “oligorecurrent” disease following prior treatment, or “oligoprogressing” disease after a prolonged duration of good disease control (2). The population of appropriate candidates has increased in recent years due to the growing range of systemic therapies that may induce deep and prolonged responses that becomes an oligometastatic state, or sustained disease control prior to oligoprogression. Along with the minority of patients with driver mutations who benefit dramatically from targeted therapies, a majority of patients with NSCLC who receive immunotherapy alone or in combination with chemotherapy can now achieve a good response to their first line systemic therapy. Along with a greater anticipated pool of strong candidates with oligometastatic NSCLC, LATs can now be pursued with markedly lower risk for the same or greater efficacy. Surgery to resect sites of metastatic/residual disease is typically feasible as a minimally invasive approach with good outcomes but fewer complications and easier recovery than the historical open surgeries required in the past (3). At the same time, stereotactic ablative body radiation (SABR) for primary or metastatic sites has now become widely established as an effective and generally very well tolerated option for patients (4), with a steadily growing body of evidence leading to wider availability of SABR. But are the theoretical benefits from LAT realized in this setting? Retrospective case series have consistent demonstrated that a subset of patients with oligometatatic NSCLC can achieve very favorable outcomes, particularly in terms of progression‐free survival (PFS) as well as overall survival (OS) in some series (5). Of course, it is not possible to determine from a retrospective case series whether these patients do extremely well because of the intervention or the selection bias due to their candidacy for LAT. Prospective randomized trial results up to this point have been limited but highly supportive of significant benefits. An MD Anderson‐led trial for patients with <3 sites of residual disease after three months of initial systemic therapy, testing LAT vs. maintenance therapy or surveillance alone, demonstrated a benefit in PFS so profound for LAT (median 11.9 vs. 3.9 mo, HR 0.35; LR p = 0.0054) that the trial was closed early by the Data Safety Monitoring Committee, with 49 patients randomized (6). Though the data from this trial were too immature to demonstrate a significant difference in OS, there was a significant improvement in the time to development of new metastatic sites. A similar trial from UT‐Southwestern was also terminated after just 29 patients were enrolled, after demonstrating a similarly dramatic difference in PFS favoring the LAT arm (7). Notably, PFS interpretation in studies of LAT is limited by the fact that the most common site of progression is in the area(s) of known disease, but the fact that LAT extends the time to development of new and distant metastases illustrates that local therapy can change the trajectory of systemic disease. It is important to offer some caveats. First, LAT is an appropriate standard only for the subset of patients with very limited foci of disease that are amenable to eradication with LAT and without a more diffuse disease process. Whether the subset of patients for whom LAT is a standard should be 1‐2 or 3‐5 lesions has yet to be clarified, but it is critical to apply LAT selectively, just as a molecularly targeted therapy or pembrolizumab monotherapy confers benefits only selectively. Broadening the treated population excessively will dilute the value compared to that in a more narrowly defined subset. Second, LAT cannot be presumed or insinuated to be curative in the setting of oligometastatic NSCLC, but like immunotherapy or targeted therapy, it should be considered as a standard based on it conferring a significant improvement in PFS without attendant significant toxicities, and/or time to new metastases, and potentially OS. Despite the limited prospective data, the NCCN recommends consideration of LAT for patients with oligometastatic NSCLC in the various clinical settings outlined above (8). Clinical trials of LAT for oligometastatic NSCLC are ongoing, but with such substantial potential benefits alongside such limited anticipated risks, LAT for appropriate patients is rightly considered a standard for appropriately selected patients.

abstract = {Concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy (CCRT) is the treatment of choice for most fit patients with locally advanced NSCLC. Recently, adjuvant durvalumab has improved the overall survival further. However, CCRT is a toxic treatment. Treatment‐related deaths occur in a few percent of patients and many suffer severe side effects that require medical interventions and even in‐patient care. In contrast to extensive research on infections and emesis, most data on other important side effects are scant. Two examples of this are acute esophagitis and cough and dyspnea. Correlation between dysphagia and endoscopic findings In a prospective trial with 38 patients receiving radiotherapy alone for lung cancer, an endoscopy was done during radiotherapy when patients had received a dose of 30‐40 Gy on the esophagus. Eighteen patients (47 %) had dysphagia of any grade, but only in 12 of them (67 %) endoscopy showed esophagitis. Of the remaining 20 patients without complaints, 5 (25 %) had endoscopic signs of esophagitis. Gastritis was found in 18 patients (47 %), with or without esophagitis. In another study, 82 NSCLC patients were evaluated by endoscopy. There was a good correlation between the RTOG clinical score for dysphagia and the endoscopic findings (Spearman rank correlation coefficient 0.428; p< 0.0001). All patients with clinical grade 3 dysphagia had endoscopic grade 2 or 3 esophagitis. Also in case of RTOG grade 2 dysphagia, all patients had endoscopic esophagitis, although 40 % had endoscopic grade 1 and 27 % had endoscopic grade 3 esophagitis. Of patients with or without only mild (grade 1) dysphagia, 11 % showed grade 3 endoscopic esophagitis. Sixteen percent of patients has esophageal candidiasis, but its relation with dysphagia or endoscopic grade of esophagitis was not reported. No data on the incidence of gastritis were given. Effect of radiotherapy on esophageal motility An impaired esophageal motility may also lead to dysphagia. The esophageal transit time (ETT) before and during (10 Gy and 30 Gy) radiotherapy alone was evaluated in 11 patients. An increase in the ETT was seen in 9 of 11 patients (82%) (p<0.05). The ETT was also investigated in 18 breast cancer patients receiving radiotherapy to the inner quadrants of the breast using a dose of 50 Gy/ 25 fractions. The cranial part of the esophagus received a mean dose of 6 Gy/ 25 fractions, and the distal two‐thirds a mean dose of 15.3 Gy/ 25 fractions. Comparing the ETT before and after radiotherapy, for the upper third and the distal two‐thirds of the esophagus, the ETT increased from 4.77 ± 1.08 sec. to 6.92 ± 2.15 sec., from 11.22 ± 2.85 sec to 23.30 ± 5.65 sec. and from 11.61 ± 2.97 sec. to 23.74 ± 5.70 sec., respectively (p<0.001). Because of the motility impairment even at very low radiotherapy doses, the use of proton pump inhibitors is logical. Prevention and treatment of acute esophagitis In a randomized study with advanced NSCLC patients, treated with radiotherapy alone or radiotherapy plus amifostine, amifostine reduced the incidence of esophagitis in week 4 during radiotherapy from 42 % (31/73) to 4 % (3/73) (p<0.001), without decreasing the tumor response 2 months after treatment. In a larger randomized series of the RTOG, 243 stage II‐III NSCLC patients were enrolled and randomized between carboplatin‐paclitaxel concurrent chemo‐radiotherapy with or without amifostine. No significant differences between the arms regarding overall survival, disease‐free survival or long‐term toxicity were observed. In another study, 60 stage III NSCLC patients were randomized between concurrent carboplatin‐paclitaxel and radiotherapy with or without amifostine. No significant difference in esophagitis was observed. Therefore, amifostine has no consistently proven effect of preventing acute radiation‐induced esophagitis. In a small double‐blind study, 14 stage III NSCLC patients were randomized between placebo or prophylactic indomethacin. Endoscopically‐assessed esophagitis seemed to be milder, but no firm conclusions could be drawn. Another small, placebo‐controlled randomized trial, investigated naproxen in 28 stage III NSCLC patients receiving radiotherapy alone. There were no differences in clinical or endoscopic esophagitis rates. Eight patients (29 %) developed esophageal candidiasis, with no difference between the groups. A placebo‐controlled randomized trial could not demonstrate a beneficial effect of sucralfate on dysphagia. In NRG/ RTOG 1012, patients were randomized between prophylactic Manuka honey, either in liquid or in lozenge form, and standard supportive care during concurrent chemo‐radiotherapy for NSCLC. Standard supportive care consisted of a compound containing viscous lidocaine, an antacid such as magnesium aluminum oxide, and liquid or solid oxycodone, 5–10 mg, every 3 hours as needed. The primary endpoint was patient‐reported pain on swallowing utilizing an eleven point (0–10) scale at 4 weeks (Numerical Rating Pain Scale, NRPS). Fifty‐three patients were randomized to supportive care, 54 randomized to liquid honey and 56 to lozenge honey. There was no significant difference in the primary endpoint of change in the NRPS at 4 weeks between arms. There were no differences in any of the secondary endpoints except for opioid use at 4 weeks during treatment between the supportive care and liquid honey arms (p=0.03), with 52 % vs. 67 % of patients experiencing no pain with liquid honey. No difference was observed with lozenge honey. with more patients on the supportive care arm taking opioids. However, the differences were only observed at 4 weeks and not at the end of radiotherapy. From this example, already, it is clear that more in‐depth knowledge of the physiopathology of radiation injury is needed. A joint task force between ESTRO and ESMO members will address a spectrum of supportive care interventions in patients receiving concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy for lung cancer.

abstract = {AIMS: The main goal of proposed study is to assess synergy of tumor cryoablation and immune checkpoint inhibitor in high‐risk breast cancer in humans. This will be achieved by comparing cryoablation alone and cryoablation in combination with pembrolizumab ‐ a [checkpoint inhibitor (anti PD‐1/PD‐L1 antibody) currently FDA approved as cancer therapy] with the current standard of care including surgical resection. The current standard of neoadjuvant/ adjuvant therapies will remain unchanged for ethical reasons of providing best‐known standard of care to all patients. OBJECTIVES: The investigators propose a prospective randomized exploratory trial where patients with clinical stage I/II, triple negative invasive breast cancer will be randomized to one of the three arms of the study: 1. Standard of care ‐ neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgical resection followed by appropriate adjuvant therapy as needed. 2. Cryoablation arm ‐ cryoablation followed by appropriate neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgical resection followed by appropriate adjuvant therapy as needed. 3. Cryoablation with Pembrolizumab ‐ Single dose of Pembrolizumab of 200 mg before (within 24‐48 hours) of cryoablation followed by appropriate neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgical resection followed by appropriate adjuvant therapy as needed. Outcome measures will include blood and tumor analysis of immune response with flow cytometry and cytokine analysis at baseline, after intervention, and before surgery. Tissue from core biopsy at baseline, repeat biopsy before chemotherapy and tumor resection will also be analyzed for tumor microenvironment. INTRODUCTION / BACKGROUND / SIGNIFICANCE: High Risk Breast Cancer and Need for Newer Treatment Approaches: Triple‐ negative breast cancer, which represent 15‐20% of all breast cancer diagnoses are considered high‐risk. While surgical resection remains the mainstay of treatment, therapeutic backbone includes neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy. For patients who continue to have significant residual disease even after surgical resection and completion of chemotherapy, further aggressive systemic therapies such as capecitabine are performed. Triple‐negative subtype is associated with the highest number of mutations across the genome and non‐metastatic disease is associated with 17‐20% local failure and 35‐ 40% distant failure at 5‐10 years of follow up. These data suggest that micrometastatic hematogenous spread happens in a substantial number of patients with operable high‐risk breast cancer and newer approaches are required that potentiate local control while simultaneously controlling the systemic spread of disease. Scope of Immune‐modulation: Cancer immunotherapy has experienced extraordinary success in recent decades. Antigens that can evoke anti‐tumor immune responses form a suitable immunotherapeutic target. The approach of T cell checkpoint blockade therapies has shown remarkable clinical responses in several types of solid cancers such as, melanoma, non‐small cell lung cancer, bladder cancer and mismatch repair‐ deficient cancers. An effective anti‐tumor immune response is thought to be initiated by the taking up of tumor antigens by antigen‐ presenting cells (APCs), which is turn present them, and provide co‐stimulatory signals to both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. APCs, particularly dendritic cells, process antigens through an exogenous antigen processing pathway where tumor cell material is phagocytosed and converted into HLA class I and class II binding peptides that are presented to CD8+ (cross‐presentation) and CD4+ T cells, respectively. Utilizing this knowledge, recent phase 1 trials have reported enhanced response to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy in combination with conventional chemotherapy in triple‐negative breast cancers. Certainly, percentage of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) has been identified as an important immunologic parameter, particularly for high‐risk breast cancers, that correlates with response to systemic therapy, suggesting a strong role of host immune response in cancer control irrespective of therapeutic intervention. Limitation of Immune‐modulation ‐ T cells are key players in anti‐tumor immunity and therefore form the major target for immunotherapeutic research. The current breakthrough in cancer immunotherapy results from the identification and targeting of checkpoint mechanism involving CTLA‐4, PD‐1, and PD‐L1. CTLA‐4 and PD‐1 are co‐inhibitory receptors found on the surface of T cells. Upon binding to their corresponding ligands (CD 80/86 and PD‐L1/L2, respectively), T cells become anergic ‐ a physiologic mechanism of tolerance. In the context of tumor microenvironment, the aberrant expression along with chronic exposure to tumor antigens can lead to undesirable suppression of T cell immunity. Recently developed checkpoint blockers, such as PD‐1/ PD‐L1 inhibitor, pembrolizumab, has provide a new weapon against cancer with durable clinical responses and long‐term remissions. However, checkpoint blockade has been shown to be most effective in tumors with high mutation burden, in line with the notion that T cell recognition of neo‐antigens plays a major role in checkpoint blockade. Many studies show that when the tumor‐reactive T cell infiltrate is absent or low (low percentage of TILs), the substrate for checkpoint blockade is lacking. Additionally, majority of patients with so called hyper‐mutated tumors do not respond to checkpoint blockade due to immune‐editing, which compromises the T cells' ability to fulfill their cytotoxic activity of adequate tumor infiltration and recognition of tumor‐antigen‐loaded HLA class I molecules. Therefore enhancing antigen presentation within the tumor is essential for checkpoint blockade to be effective. Role of Ablative Therapies ‐ Particularly Cryoablation: Thermal ablation with cryotherapy, laser, radiofrequency, microwave, and focused ultrasound present a unique opportunity to address both, the primary tumor and the micrometastatic disease. The effects of tumor ablation are multifold: (1) the destruction of tumor mass, lowering tumor burden and (2) the release of tumor antigens, making them available for uptake by antigen presenting cells (APCs) and the treatment itself leads to (3) the release of damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and (4) the induction of a physiological wound healing response. Ablation leads to creation of an in situ antigen depot containing all types of tumor protein, which leads to initiation of systemic anti‐tumor immune response that can potentially eliminate occult metastatic disease. Ablation of tumors at temperatures above 65 °C leads to denaturation of proteins. This can affect immune responses in opposing ways as high temperatures denature immune activating signals, such as danger signals like heat shock proteins (HSPs). Therefore cryoablation is the most promising ablative technique, as it offers minimal invasiveness, less damage to surrounding tissues, and better preservation of tumor antigens, and most robust data on immune stimulation. Immune Stimulation Effected by Cryoablation ‐ Deep freezing and thawing during cryoablation induces necrosis and the up‐regulation of DAMP molecules that render tumor cells more susceptible to APCs and tumor specific T‐cell‐mediated killing. Cryoablation upregulates DAMPs, such as HMG1, calreticulin, S100A8/A9 and HSP70, which stimulate the immune system through Receptor for Advanced Glycosylation End‐products (RAGE) and toll‐like receptors and enhance antigen presentation. Additionally, the central zone cytokine milieu resulting from cryoablation is typically a Th1 cytokine profile of IL‐2, INF‐γ, TNF‐α, and IL‐12. These cytokines and DAMPs presumably drive the cytotoxic CD8+ T‐cell response. Preclinical evidence supporting immune response of cryoablation: Several preclinical studies on cryoimmunology explored whether freezing the tumor and leaving it in situ would render the animal resistant to a re‐challenge. Animal models utilizing carcinoma and sarcoma cell lines in rabbits and mice demonstrated tumor‐ specific resistance to re‐challenge. Re‐challenge with same tumor cell lines showed resistance to growth in animals after cryoablation compared to surgical resection. Similar experience was reported by Blackwood and Cooper with models involving rats inoculated with myosarcoma and carcinosarcoma cell lines. Rats with cryoablated tumors were more likely to resist re‐challenge, and demonstrated regression of secondary tumors compared to surgically treated rats. Bagley compared cryoablation with surgery in using MCA‐10 fibrosarcoma in C57BL/6 mice, harvesting splenic lymphocytes at weekly intervals after treatment for cytotoxicity assays. Mice undergoing cryoablation had significantly higher cytotoxicity than surgically treated or untreated mice. Sabel studied MT‐901 mammary adenocarcinoma tumors in BALB/c mice treated with cryoablation or surgical resection. After re‐challenge, 86% of mice treated with surgery developed second tumors compared with 16% of mice treated with cryoablation. This was tumor‐ specific, as the cryoablation offered no protection against challenge with other cell lines. More recently, Kim utilizing renal cell carcinoma cell lines in BALB/c mice reported similar results. More recently, abscopal effect of tumor regression in untreated tumors in animal models where only one of the implanted tumors was cryoablated, has been reported as a result of systemic immune response. Clinical evidence supporting immune response of cryoablation: Although clinical use of cryoablation for cancer has recently expanded, there are relatively few studies examining the immunological impact in humans. Ravindranath measured the level of serum tumor gangliosides and their antibody titers in patients receiving cryoablation, radiofrequency ablation or resection of liver metastasis from colorectal cancer. Serum ganglioside levels were significantly higher in cryoablated patients compared to radiofrequency or surgery. Cryoablated patients also demonstrated higher titers of IgM against tumor gangliosides. Si studied 20 patients with prostate cancer undergoing cryoablation of primary tumor and reported an increase in in cytolytic activity against LNCaP, and an increase in number of IFN‐ɣ producing T cells. Thakur conducted a pilot study of cryoablation and GM‐SCF for patients with renal cell carcinoma metastatic to lung. GM‐CSF was infiltrated near a lung metastatic lesion selected for cryoablation. Additional GM‐CSF therapy was used post‐procedure. The combination of GM‐CSF and cryoablation produced an enhanced immune response in terms of cytotoxicity and serum antibodies. Limitation of Cryoablation: Despite the data reviewed above, immune response to cryoablation has not been uniform. Some preclinical studies on osteogenic sarcoma, and prostate cancer models, failed to show any increase in immune function after cryoablation. More importantly, several studies have reported immune suppression with cryosurgery. The majority of these studies involved fibrosarcoma cell lines in rats and showed decreased resistance to re‐challenge after cryoablation, as well increased growth of metastatic tumors and secondary tumors. From a breast cancer perspective, Sabel reported that a high freeze rate resulted in increased tumor‐specific T‐cells in the tumor draining lymph nodes, reduction in lung metastasis and improved survival compared to low freeze rates which also had more Tregs (CD3,CD4,CD127‐,CD25+). Therefore, the magnitude of systemic effect induced by cryotherapy alone has proven to be either insufficient or counter‐productive. Current understanding is that close to the ablative source, direct injury and cell death with necrosis releases tumor antigens and (DAMPs) which recruit and activate dendritic cells that in turn stimulate proliferation of T cells and immune components. Transition zone away from the ablative source causes indirect cellular injury and apoptotic cell death without release of DAMPs, which causes release of suppressive cytokines and T‐cell clonal deletion and anergy. Intuitively, cryoablation stimulates an immune response but the ultimate clinical impact is dictated by the ratio of CD4+ T‐effector cells to T‐regulatory cells. Higher T‐effector to T‐regulatory cell ratio promotes the more favorable CD8 cytotoxic T cell response. While CD8+ cytotoxic cells eliminate the primary tumor and systemic micrometastasis, it is important that anergy is kept in check and both effector (CD45RO+, CCR7‐) and central (CCR7+, CD45RO+) memory T‐cells are established for long‐term protective anti‐ tumor immunity. HYPOTHESIS: "Combination of cryoablation with Pembrolizumab for local control in high‐risk triple negative breast cancer is superior to surgical resection alone or cryoablation alone in generating antitumor immune response". METHODS: Site of Study: Proposed exploratory work is a randomized trial that will be conducted at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center‐Breast Center of Excellence, UMC Cancer Center. Type of study: Prospective Randomized Trial ‐ hypothesis driven Experimental Design: The investigators propose a single blinded prospective randomized trial, where women with Stage I/II triple negative breast cancer will be enrolled in one of the three arms in 1:1:1 randomized fashion: (I) Control arm with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by lumpectomy/mastectomy with sentinel node biopsy +/‐ axillary dissection; (II) Intervention with cryoablation alone followed by neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by lumpectomy/mastectomy with sentinel node biopsy +/‐ axillary dissection; (III) Intervention with cryoablation + Pembrolizumab followed by neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by lumpectomy/mastectomy with sentinel node biopsy +/‐ axillary dissection. The treatment schedule is designed to optimize antigen exposure time. The trial will be registered at the National Clinical Trials Network once IRB approval is obtained. Subjects: All patients 18 and older with clinical stage I/II triple negative disease will be offered to participate. These patients will be screened during an oncology/surgery appointment by the study team. A computerized randomization list will be used for treatment arm assignment using the website: https://www.sealedenvelope.com/simple‐randomiser/v1/lists Inclusion Criteria: ‐ Females ‐ Stage I/II Cancer ‐ Age range 18 ‐ 90 years ‐ Diagnoses: Invasive carcinoma, ER ‐, PR‐, HER2‐ (triple negative) ‐ Radiology findings: Unifocal disease visible on ultrasound Exclusion Criteria: ‐ Additional primary cancer ‐ Inflammatory breast cancer ‐ History of autoimmune disease ‐ History of chronic immunosuppression ‐ Prior immunotherapy ‐ Recent vaccination (within 4 wks.) ‐ Prior radiation therapy ‐ Prior investigational agent therapy within last 1 year ‐ Pregnancy at the time of diagnosis and/ or treatment ‐ Breast feeding Study visits: Informed consent will be obtained then the patient will be randomized. All visit will coincide with standard of care visits. Next, the following will occur: Visit 1: Day 1: Baseline Blood draw; up to 20ml will be collected in EDTA tubes; the blood will be centrifuged at TTUHSC. Plasma will be used for cytokine analysis and phenotyping at TTU lab. One EDTA tube will be sent to University of Houston (throughout the study time‐points). Following outcomes will be measured: Cytokine analysis ‐ RNA seq PBMC analysis Baseline core biopsy tissue (already available from diagnostic workup) will be evaluated for: (2 unstained slides will be prepared for RNA seq from fixed tissue) ‐ TIL % ‐ RNA Seq tumor tissue Visit 2 (Group II & III Only) After Cryoablation: Day 3 (+/‐ 7 days): Post‐ablation blood draw (Group II & III)‐ up to 10ml of blood in EDTA tube(s): • Cytokine analysis Visit 3 (All groups) Pre Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy: Day 21 (+/‐ 14 days): Blood draw at the time of port insertion for chemotherapy‐ up to 20ml of blood in EDTA tubes: ‐ Immune phenotyping by flow cytometry ‐ Cytokine analysis ‐ RNA seq PBMC analysis ‐ Tumor biopsy will be repeated for TIL and RNA seq analysis Visit 4 (All groups): Post Chemotherapy Resection (approximately 6 months after original biopsy): Preoperative blood draw‐ up to 20ml blood in EDTA tubes (similar to baseline): ‐ Immune phenotyping by flow cytometry ‐ Cytokine analysis ‐ RNA seq PBMC analysis Surgical specimen tissue analysis (2 unstained slides from fixed tissues will be prepared for RNA seq) ‐ TIL% ‐ RNA seq tumor tissue Sample Size: Tumor‐infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), particularly in the stroma of triple negative breast cancer are prognostic and predictive of response to therapy. Therefore, recommendations by the International TILs Working Group were used to calculate the sample size for this project. The percentage change of TILs is assumed to be 10% for the control arm and 50% for the treatment arm. A sample of 10 patients per group can achieve 80% power to detect a mean difference of 0.4 (0.5 vs. 0.1) with a standard deviation of 0.3, using a two‐sided two‐sample equal variance t‐test (alpha=0.05). Assuming 30% drop out rate, a total of 12 patients in each arm would suffice for a total of 36 patients; this would achieve a 90% power. This means that a minimum of 10 patients per arm and a maximum of 12 patients per arm will lead to a statistically meaningful study. Statistical Plan: Descriptive statistics will be used to compute the ranges, means, and variances for the independent variables standard care, cryo, cryo+pembro. This will suggest that the concentration of the observations around the mean, and variation of the observations from the means. The normality test will be considered to check whether or not data follow normal distribution. Normal quantile‐quantile plots (also called q‐q plots) will be utilized to determine if data sets come from a normal population. To detect the outliers (if there is any) several statistical measures will be taken into consideration. To check the homogeneity of variances for the independent variables standard care, cryo, cryo+pembro, Levene's test will be performed by setting up null and alternative hypotheses. To compare the significance difference among the means of the variables, a one‐way analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be performed. The null and alternative hypotheses for the means will be introduced. In ANOVA, statistical significance of the means will be tested (α = 0.05) by using the F‐test statistic. If the means are found statistical significant difference then the post‐hoc multiple comparisons tests will be performed. Post‐hoc multiple comparisons tests (LSD, Bonferroni, Scheffe, Tukey, etc.) will be utilized to detect the appropriate significant group means. If the samples do not meet the normality assumptions then several non‐parametric tests will be considered for the statistical analyses. Tumor Cryoablation: All registered patients will be randomized to one of the three arms of the study. Patients in arm II and III will receive cryoablation according to the following protocol (similar to the protocol used in ACOSOG Z1072 trial). Cryoablation Device: Cryoablation will be performed using the commercially available ProSense Cryosurgical System (IceCure Medical Ltd, Caesarea, Israel) consisting of a console, cryoprobe and associated liquid nitrogen (cryogen) Case Dewars. The console is a self‐contained unit that features an interface for controlling and monitoring the cryoablation procedure. It operates with standard 120 VAC (60Hz) power. Device Operation: The ProSense Cryosurgical System uses a closed system to circulate liquid nitrogen within the cryoprobe tip creating sub‐freezing temperatures that result in ablation of target tissue. The lesion is identified with ultrasound and the cryoprobe is placed in the center of the lesion under ultrasound guidance after adequate local anesthesia, and ablation is carried out according to predetermined freeze‐thaw‐freeze algorithm. The probe is then warmed by an internal electrical resistance heater and removed from the patient. Cryoablation Procedure: Tumor is identified using high‐resolution linear array ultrasound probe in two orthogonal views. Longest dimension of the tumor is identified for parallel insertion of the probe. This dimension is entered into the console; the console provides the length of cryoprobe tip to be past the lesion upon insertion. After insertion, the probe position is confirmed in two orthogonal views. Cryoablation is done using the freeze‐thaw‐freeze cycle according to the tumor size. Entire procedure is monitored under vision and saline is infiltrated to avoid skin frostbite by hydro‐ dissecting the skin away from the ice‐ball. Size of ice‐ball is recorded in orthogonal dimensions. In our protocol, if a patient has more than one lesions, only one lesion will be ablated; however biopsies from other lesions will be studied for abscopal affect. Infusion of Pembrolizumab and Dosing: As an initial step, the investigators confirmed the safety and tolerability of immune checkpoint inhibitors with tumor cryoablation in women with newly diagnosed breast cancer. One important consideration was selection of an immune modulating antibody. Pembrolizumab, an FDA‐approved antibody against PD‐1/PD‐L1, has a well‐established safety profile, and induces long‐term remissions lasting >10 years in 10‐20% of advanced melanoma patients. Furthermore, because T cells acutely upregulate expression of PD‐1/PD‐L1 after being exposed to antigens, which in turn may blunt the cytotoxic response, pembrolizumab is ideally suited for immune modulation in combination with cryoablation. Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) published a pilot study on this combination; no serious side effects attributable to ipilimumab were reported; no surgery was delayed. MSKCC used 10 mg/Kg as a single dose; however, since the studies report higher adverse events at that dose, the investigator propose the recommended 200 mg for IV over 90 minutes dose before cryoablation, which is the currently utilized dose in clinical setting for triple negative cancers. Methodology for Outcome Measures: The investigators will observe and monitor the immune response(s) following the cryoablation procedures with and without the pembrolizumab. Blood samples will be collected in EDTA‐blood collection tubes and then aliquoted for T‐cell phenotypic analysis, and plasma collection for cytokine/chemokine, and for RNA seq analysis, at the indicated time points. Pathology slides will be made for research from core biopsy samples at baseline and from lumpectomy and sentinel nodes at the time of surgery. Five slides will be made per specimen (after completion of routine pathology) for H&E and immunohistochemistry for immune cell infiltrates to calculate TILs percentage. All collaborators/Key personnel involved in performing the outcome measure analysis will be blinded to the randomization groups. Following are the details for outcome analysis: TIL Calculation: All tissue specimens that undergo routine pathology reporting will be evaluated for TIL reporting according to guidelines put forth by the International TILs Working Group. Change in TIL score between original core biopsy tissue and surgical tissue will be the focus of analysis to assess the impact of proposed interventions. Measurement of T‐cell Changes in Blood: T‐cell subtypes can be defined by differential expression of cell surface markers. The investigators will monitor T‐cells for activation, increased CD8+ effector T‐cells and development of effector and central memory. For T‐cell phenotyping, whole blood staining (100 µl/stain) will be performed with antibodies to CD3, CD4, CD8, CD25, CD27, CD45RO, CD127, CD137, ICOS, CCR7 and Ki67 with appropriate isotype controls. Following RBC lysis, the stained mononuclear cells will be run on an Attune NxT 14‐color flow cytometer (Thermofisher, Waltham, MA) and analyzed using FlowJo software (Becton, Dickinson and Company). T‐cells (CD3+, CD4+ or CD8+) will be analyzed for changes in naïve (CD27+, CCR7+, CD45RO‐), effector (CCR7‐, CD45RO‐), effector memory (CD27‐, CCR7‐,CD45RO+) and central memory (CD27+, CCR7+, CD45RO+) phenotypic markers as well as for activation (ICOS and CD137) and proliferation (Ki67). The investigators will further analyze for percentages of T‐regulatory cells (CD25+, CD127‐). The investigators will use this data to determine a T‐cell immune signature to correlate the effectiveness of the cryoabalation+/‐ Pembrolizumab to predict the long‐term anti‐tumor immunity. Plasma Cytokine/Chemokine Analysis: Our initial analysis will be to determine which cytokines/chemokines and what concentrations are detected in the blood following cryoablation +/‐ pembrolizumab and how their profiles are altered. The investigators will focus on the inflammatory and helper T‐cell cytokine profiles and how these cytokines influence and direct the T‐cell response. Additionally, the investigators will look at changes in chemokines. Their altered expression in malignancies have been shown to dictate leukocyte recruitment and activation, angiogenesis, cancer cell proliferation, and metastasis in all the stages of the disease. At baseline, 24‐48 hours post ablation, between pre chemotherapy, blood will be collected and plasma isolated by centrifuging 1‐2 mls of blood at 1‐2000 x g for 10 minutes and then aliquoting 120 µl into 0.65 mL microcentrifuge tubes. Standard of care group will only have 3 blood sample time points. Plasma samples will be analyzed with a Bio‐Plex 200 at Eve Technologies Corporation (Calgary, AB Canada) using the Human High Sensitivity T‐Cell Discovery Array 14‐plex (HDHSTC14): GM‐CSF, IFNy, IL‐1B, IL‐2, IL‐4, IL‐5, IL‐6, IL‐8, IL‐10, IL‐12p70, IL‐13, IL‐17A, IL‐23, TNF‐a. DATA SHEET: See Excel spreadsheet. The RNA seq will be collected as heat maps for differentially expressed genes. RISKS: Blood draw risks: The risks of a blood draw include: pain, discomfort, bleeding, bruising, redness, infection where the needle enters the skin; feeling lightheaded, fainting. Cryoablation related risks: Cryoablation has been a very safe procedure; PI has been routinely offering this procedure to benign and cancer disease in the breast; so far, 18 cancer patients and 36 benign lesions have been subjected to the procedure. The following mild complications have been reported thus far: ‐ Bruising at the site of ablation ‐ self‐limited. ‐ Pain ‐ managed with OTC analgesics. ‐ Skin necrosis is a theoretical possibility however, following the procedure protocol; the investigators have never had this complication. Pembrolizumab related risks: There have been extensive studies on toxicities of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Standard recommended dose for Pemrolizumab is 200 mg IV per dose (approved by the FDA). Anticipated adverse effects include: ‐ Rash ‐ Diarrhea ‐ Constipation ‐ Nausea ‐ Weight loss ‐ Dry eyes ‐ Fatigue ‐ Headache ‐ Fever ‐ Joint pain ‐ Thyroid dysfunction Loss of Confidentiality: All data will be maintained in password‐protected files within the CRI and PI's office. All data will be de‐identified for compilation and analysis. All protocols for HIPAA compliance will be followed. However, minimal risk of breach in confidentiality is possible due to human error. BENEFITS: The patients in arm II and III may benefit by participation in the trial. If our intuition of immune modulation via combination of cryotherapy and checkpoint inhibitor drug actually affects the control of tumor, these two groups will directly benefit form participation. However, the control arm I is not going to benefit from the trial beyond providing a comparison arm for the study. The main goal of the proposed study is to identify a novel low‐risk treatment approach to these high‐risk cancers, which will ultimately benefit the future cancer patients. MONITORING: To ensure compliance with the study protocol, GCP guidelines, and TTUHSC Human Research Protection Program research policies and procedures during the conduct of the study, as well as quality data, a monitor in the Clinical Research Institute will conduct the monitoring of the study. The first monitoring visit will be conducted within two weeks after the first subject has been enrolled into the study. The succeeding monitoring visits will be scheduled periodically, but no less than every 2 months when there is an active study participant, at a mutually agreed timeframe by the PI and study monitor. All data collected will be 100% source document verified. The study monitor may inspect and audit all study documents, i.e. data collection forms, questionnaires, drug accountability, and medical records within the applicable confidentiality regulations.

abstract = {Background: Advanced NSCLC is a frequent cancer among our patients. Delay in diagnosis and treatment leads to advanced stages that require complex treatment modalities and poor prognosis. We report our experience in term of epidemiological, diagnostic, therapeutic and prognostic aspects of this disease in our department. Method: This is a retrospective study of 38 cases of advanced NSCLC treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy, collected in the radiotherapy department in the University Hospital Hassan II in Fez, between January 2012 and January 2017. All cancers were prooved histologically by biopsy. The standard treatment was concurrent chemoradiotherapy alone or after induction chemotherapy mostly due to a large tumor volume where radiotherapy is not feasible upfront. Chemotherapy drugs were mainly cisplatin‐based with vinorelbine or paclitaxel and in some cases carboplatin if renal function is not correct. Radiotherapy was delivered through 3D conformal technique after CT‐simulation and image fusion with CT or in rare cases PET‐CT. After completion of treatment, no patient received adjuvant chemotherapy. Immune therapy was not affordable due to the high price. Follow‐up was done clinically and with control CTscan. Tobacco control counseling was recommended to all our patients. Result: The average age was 59 years (38 to 81 years). The patients were all males and chronic smokers. Significant clinical symptoms were mainly chest pain, dyspnea and hemoptysis. There were 21 cases of adenocarcinoma, 17 cases of squamous cell carcinoma. 18 cases were classified as stage IIIA, 20 cases as stage IIIB. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was received in 23 cases from 2 to 4 cycles. All patients received radiotherapy with doses to PTV between 60‐70Gy with concomitant chemotherapy including cisplatin or carboplatin. After an average follow‐up of 12 months, the evolution was marked by the occurrence of 2 deaths, distant metastasis in 14 patients (6 cases of cerebral metastasis and 8 cases of bone metastasis), 2 cases of progressive disease, 14 patients in complete clinical remission and are always followed, and 6 patients were lost to follow‐up, Conclusion: It is now proven that the survival of patients with locally advanced lung cancer is better if chemotherapy is combined with radiotherapy. The survival gain obtained is essentially related to better control of micro‐metastases even though the local control remains very poor. Some irradiation techniques seem to be able to improve this local control: conformal radiotherapy with intensity modulation, hypofractionation. Immue therapy concomitant to radiation might be the future but still needs randomized clinical trials to approve it. Keywords: Advanced NSCLC ‐ Chemotherapy ‐ Radiotherapy},

abstract = {Objective: Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is the most common pathological pattern in China, with poor prognosis due to its early and frequent metastasis. Definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy is the standard treatment for inoperable locally advanced ESCC. Studies have shown promising efficacy of immune‐checkpoint inhibitors in ESCC. This study explores the safety and efficacy of immunotherapy combined with definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced ESCC. Method: This study was an exploratory, open, single‐arm clinical trial involving 20 untreated patients with locally advanced ESCC. The patients were treated with eight cycles (4 weeks per cycle) of SHR‐1210 concurrently combined with 6 weeks of radiotherapy, and 4 weeks of chemotherapy and apatinib beginning from 4 weeks after the completion of radiotherapy to the end of treatment. Primary end‐points were treatment‐related adverse events, serious adverse events, and patients’ quality of life (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer's Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ)‐C30 and QLQ‐OES18). Secondary end‐points were the objective response rate, progression‐free survival, and overall survival. Discussion: This phase Ib study evaluates the tolerability and efficacy of programmed cell death‐1 antibody along with definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy in treating locally advanced ESCC. This novel combination is expected to yield fewer side‐effects and better survival.},

CIMAvax‐EGF is a chemical conjugate between human‐recombinant EGF and P64, a recombinant protein from Neisseria meningitides, which induces neutralizing antibodies against EGF. In the last 15 years, it has been extensively evaluated in advanced NSCLC patients. CIMAvax‐EGF is safe, even after extended use, and able to keep EGF serum concentration below detectable levels. In a randomized phase III study, CIMAvax‐EGF increased median overall survival of advanced NSCLC patients with at least stable disease after front‐line chemotherapy. Patients bearing squamous‐cell or adenocarcinomas and serum EGF concentration above 870 pg/ml had better survival compared to control patients treated with best supportive care as maintenance, confirming tumors’ sensitivity to the EGF depletion. This manuscript reviews the state‐of‐the‐art NSCLC therapy and proposes the most promising scenarios for evaluating CIMAvax‐EGF, particularly in combination with TKIs or ICIs. We hypothesize that the optimal combination of CIMAvax‐EGF with established therapies can further contribute to transform advanced cancer into a manageable chronic disease, compatible with years of good quality of life.},

abstract = {Introduction: Single‐agent immunotherapy or the combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy are the standard of care for metastatic non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC), regardless of histology. The combination of the anti PD‐1 nivolumab and the anti CTLA‐4 ipilimumab (NI) activates anti‐tumor T‐cell response through distinct but complementary mechanisms. This combination showed efficacy in NSCLC, including lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC). Nevertheless, no trial has specifically investigated the efficacy of NI or chemotherapy + nivolumab (CT‐Nivo) in LSCC. Methods: The SQUINT trial was a randomized, phase II trial which assesses the efficacy of two different immunotherapy strategies in patients with advanced/metastatic LSCC. All eligible patients were randomly assigned to either NI or to investigator‐choice platinum‐based CT and nivolumab. Nivolumab was administered at the standard dose of 360 mg every 3 weeks, while ipilimumab was administered at the dose of 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks. In both arms, immunotherapy was continued up to disease progression, toxicity, or patient refusal, for a maximum of 24 months. Platinum‐based CT was given up to 6 cycles. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS) at 12 months. Results: From September 2017 to February 2022, a total of 91 patients were included in the study; 45 were assigned to NI and 46 to CT‐Nivo. In both arms,the majority of patients were males (84.4% and 73.9%, respectively), with a performance status 0‐1 (97.8% and 100%), current or former smokers (95.6% and 95.7%). Bone, liver or brain metastases were present in 26.7%, 13.3% and 6.7% of patients in the NI arm and in 26.1%, 10.9% and 6.5% of patients on CT‐Nivo, respectively. Carboplatin or cisplatin in combination with gemcitabine was the most common CT regimen used in patients assigned to CT‐Nivo (98%, 28% CDDP, 70% Carbo). At the time of the present analysis, with a median follow‐up of 11 months, 62 patients are evaluable for response. At 1 year, OS rate was 59.1% with NI and 62.4% with CT‐Nivo. Median progression‐free survival was 3.8 months in the NI arm and 6.1 months in the CT‐Nivo arm. Response rate was 22.2% and 30.4%, respectively. Grade 3‐4 treatment‐related adverse events were more frequently reported with CT‐Nivo (34.8%) than with NI (15.5%), and mainly consisted in hematological toxicity. Conclusions: The preliminary results of the SQUINT trial suggest that NI or CT‐Nivo have similar activity in advanced LSCC. Additional analyses are ongoing and will be presented at the meeting.

abstract = {Introduction: Despite therapeutic advances, lung cancer remains a leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Nectin‐4, a cell adhesion molecule, is highly expressed in several epithelial tumor types, including non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Targeting Nectin‐4 in NSCLC provides a novel treatment approach. Enfortumab vedotin (EV) is an antibody‐drug conjugate comprised of a fully human monoclonal antibody directed against Nectin‐4, and monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), a microtubule‐disrupting agent, attached to the antibody via a protease‐cleavable linker. MMAE release within the cell disrupts the microtubule network, inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. In 2019, EV received accelerated approval by the US FDA for the treatment of adults with locally advanced/metastatic urothelial carcinoma (la/mUC) who have previously received a PD‐1/L1 inhibitor and a platinum‐containing chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant/adjuvant, locally advanced or metastatic setting. In EV‐301, a phase 3, randomized clinical trial of patients with previously treated la/mUC, EV significantly prolonged overall survival compared with chemotherapy (docetaxel, paclitaxel, or vinflunine). This trial‐in‐progress describing general methodology for all cohorts was presented at the 2020 ASCO Annual Meeting. Methods: This multicohort, open‐label phase 2 study (NCT04225117) evaluates efficacy and safety/tolerability of EV in patients with previously treated locally advanced/metastatic solid tumors. Approximately 240 patients (∼40 patients/cohort) with histologically/cytologically confirmed disease and ECOG performance status of ≤1 are enrolling into six tumor‐specific cohorts (Figure). Within the NSCLC cohorts, patients must have previously received mutation‐targeted therapy (if eligible) and progressed, relapsed, or discontinued treatment due to toxicity after one platinum‐based therapy for locally advanced/metastatic disease, but received ≤2 lines of cytotoxic therapy, or have progressed or relapsed within 6 months of a platinum‐based neoadjuvant, adjuvant, concomitant chemoradiation regimen for early stage or locally advanced disease. Patients must have previously received therapy with a PD‐1/L1 inhibitor, unless therapy is contraindicated. Nectin‐4 expression is not required for eligibility and is being tested for exploratory outcomes. Patients with active CNS metastases, grade ≥2 sensory/motor neuropathy, ongoing grade ≥3 immunotherapy‐related hypothyroidism or panhypopituitarism, ongoing immunotherapy‐related adverse events requiring high‐dose steroids, or a history of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus are excluded. Patients will receive 1.25‐mg/kg EV intravenously on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28‐day cycle. The primary endpoint is investigator‐assessed confirmed objective response rate (RECIST v1.1); secondary endpoints include duration of response, disease control rate, progression‐free and overall survival, and safety/tolerability. An interim analysis is planned based upon prespecified response criteria. Recruitment is ongoing at ∼50 sites in North America and Japan.

abstract = {Lung cancer incidence and mortality have been increasing steeply in the past thirty years in the mainland of China. More than 80% of lung cancer is non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). More than 40% of NSCLC patients are found to be in stage IIIb or IV, which is not resectable. The 5‐year survival rate for this group of patients is less than 5% in the SEER database. Currently, the NCCN guidelines recommend platinum‐containing double‐drug chemotherapy as the first‐ line standard of care for advanced NSCLC without driver gene mutations, and treatment options after failure of first‐line chemotherapy are limited. Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors, ICIs provide new treatment options, and in addition, radiotherapy can also be used in selected patients with advanced NSCLC, especially in patients with oligo progression, where irradiation of the thoracic primary lesions can improve the patient's respiratory‐related symptoms, reduce the tumor burden, improve the patient's quality of life, and prolong survival in some patients. Therefore, we propose that combination of immunotherapy and radiotherapy to the primary lesion for these patients, who are generally in good KPS status, may result in improved quality of life and prolonged survival. To date, there have been no clinical studies of immunotherapy combined with primary lesions radiation therapy in patients with advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (driver gene‐negative) after chemotherapy failure or recurrence, so we designed this prospective, randomized, controlled, investigator‐initiated, phase II clinical study with the primary objective of evaluating the efficacy of combined immunotherapy and primary lesions radiation therapy in this patient population. This trial aims at investigating the feasibility and efficacy of this treatment strategy.},

abstract = {Radiation therapy (RT) in locally advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (LA‐NSCLC) has not changed in its essence over many decades. The refinements in “standard‐of‐care” RT followed the general advancements applicable to many other malignancies, such as introduction of IMRT (including VMAT) and IGRT. Tumor motion appears more relevant in lung tumors than in other disease sites, and lung‐tumor interface allows for a measurable and intuitively observable movement, therefore enabling motion management in the lung to be more advanced, such as 4D CT for planning and tumor tracking (CyberKnife) or gating in daily practice. Nevertheless, the median survival time (MST) for good performance unresectable Stage II/III patients with NSCLC, treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (chemo‐RT) has improved significantly over last quarter century, from MST of 17.1 mo (RTOG 9410) to MST of 28.7 mo (RTOG 0617). Since the agents used in concurrent chemotherapy are not significantly different, other causes, mostly widespread use of PET scans for staging, as well as improved RT techniques, likely play a role. Use of CT simulation is associated with improved MST, even when adjusted for other variables, such as chemotherapy use, comorbidities or urban location. Volumetric (rather than 2D) dose prescription; use of lower energy photons and heterogeneity correction; accounting for tumor motion with a 4D CT simulation and IGRT; better understanding of normal tissue tolerance (lung V20) and of the need to limit RT course breaks, all add incremental benefits for a more favorable outcome. In addition, factors such as RT center's experience and volume of treated patients, as well as any protocol deviations in clinical trials, have been found to have a major impact in clinical practice, raising the possibility that strict adherence to RT planning guidelines might benefit all cancer patients treated with RT. Those factors have not yet been accounted for as eligibility/stratification factors in studies. Some much touted newer technologies, as particle RT (protons) have not so far demonstrated a verifiable superiority over photons. The Phase II randomized MDACC trial of photon vs. proton‐based chemoradiotherapy for patients with Stage III or oligometastatic NSCLC did not show a difference in radiation pneumonitis rates between the arms and no improvement in local control in the proton arm. However, a steep learning curve in using proton RT was discovered, with lower pneumonitis rates in those patients in the proton group who were treated in the latter half of the study vs. those treated in its early phase. The ongoing NRG Oncology/RTOG 1308 Phase III randomized trial of photon vs. proton chemo‐RT (70 Gy, but not lower than 60 Gy) has had a slow accrual, partially due to the paucity of participating centers, since proton technology is not widespread yet; also, a high percentage of patients not being able to enroll due to medical insurance coverage denial for protons, as well as possible perceptions of the superiority of protons. That study's design has been modified recently to allow for a faster study's completion. The original primary endpoint was overall survival, in contrast to the MDACC trial, where pneumonitis and local failure rate were co‐endpoints. In order to complete the RTOG 1308 trial sooner by lowering its target accrual, the current primary hypothesis is that the MST in the proton arm is non‐inferior to the photon arm (i.e. 28 mo), and major cardiac toxicity and grade 4 or higher lymphopenia is better in the proton vs. photon arm. Additionally, the Quality of Life hypothesis is that, compared with patients receiving photon therapy, patients on the proton arm will have less severe shortness of breath 6 months after the end of concurrent chemor‐RT (representing late adverse response to therapy), and that the differences in symptom ratings (based on MDASI shortness of breath item) between arms will be clinically meaningful. The recent availability of Magnetic Resonance (MR)‐Guided RT may open a new era in lung cancer RT, allowing for the real‐time intrafractional tumor tracking and “on the fly” adaptive RT, both likely to allow smaller tumor target volumes and a rigorous evaluation of doses delivered to the normal structures, therefore lowering toxicity and potentially opening the door to reassessment of RT dose intensification. Finally, with the explosion of evidence‐based applications of immunotherapy in metastatic lung cancer and the demonstration of an impressive survival prolongation in the Phase III randomized PACIFIC trial with the addition of maintenance durvalumab following chemo‐RT, the role of chemotherapy may be eventually challenged and reevaluated in Stage III NSCLC, to be possibly replaced by concurrent immunotherapy or a chemo‐immunotherapy combination.

abstract = {Gastric cancer, including gastroesophageal junction cancer, is the fifth most common cancer and the third leading cause of death in the world. Among them, although the incidence of distal gastric adenocarcinoma is decreasing, the incidence of gastroesophageal junction cancer is increasing. At present, surgery is still the main treatment for gastroesophageal junction cancer. At the same time, multi‐mode comprehensive treatment such as chemotherapy and molecular targeted therapy can effectively alleviate pathological progression, facilitate R0 resection and improve the overall survival of patients. A large number of previous clinical trials on the combination of first‐line chemotherapy and molecular targeted drugs in the treatment of gastric and gastroesophageal junction cancer have shown that only trastuzumab can improve the overall survival rate of Her‐2 positive patients. In addition, despite various clinical chemotherapy regimens, the median survival time of gastric cancer and gastroesophageal junction cancer is not high. Therefore, the treatment mode of gastroesophageal junction cancer, especially for Her‐2 negative patients, needs to be explored and improved. In recent years, immune checkpoint inhibitors represented by programmed death receptor 1 (PD‐1)/programmed death receptor ligand 1 (PD‐L1) inhibitors have been applied to the treatment of a variety of solid tumors such as melanoma, non‐small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, head and neck cancer, and urothelial cancer. It has become another important treatment strategy after surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and targeted therapy. Studies have shown that PD‐L1 is highly expressed in tumor cells and immune cells in gastric cancer and gastroesophageal junction cancer and plays a key role in tumor immune escape, therefore, the PD‐1/ PD‐L1 pathway will become an important target for effective intervention in gastroesophageal junction cancer. As a PD‐1 inhibitor, Pembrolizumab has been shown to have anti‐tumor activity and manageable safety in gastroesophageal junction cancer, and was approved by the US FDA in September 2017 for advanced PD‐L1‐positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer . The phase Ⅱ KEYNOTE‐059 trial used Pembrolizumab as a single agent in the third‐line treatment of advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer, and the results showed that it had controllable safety in patients with PD‐L1 positive, with obvious advantages in objective response rate (ORR) and median duration of response (DOR) [12]. Chemotherapy enhances tumor immune responses by enhancing tumor cell immunogenicity and sensitivity to immune killing, and the combination of chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors has been shown to improve overall survival in several cancer types. Therefore, PD‐1/ PD‐L1 immunosuppressant combined with chemotherapy has become a hot spot in the research of advanced gastric cancer or gastroesophageal junction cancer . The phase 3 KEYNOTE‐062 trial compared Pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy (cisplatin plus 5‐FU or capecitabine) with chemotherapy alone or Pembrolizumab alone in the first‐line treatment of advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer. However, compared with chemotherapy alone, Pembrolizumab combined with chemotherapy could not significantly prolong the overall survival of patients, and the overall effect was not better than chemotherapy alone . In contrast, the phase III KEYNOTE‐590 study, designed to compare the efficacy and safety of Pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy (cisplatin plus fluorouracil) versus chemotherapy alone as first‐line treatment for advanced esophageal and Siwert type I gastroesophageal junction cancer, showed that Pembrolizumab combined with chemotherapy was significantly superior to chemotherapy alone . Neither the KEYNOTE‐062 trial nor the KEYNOTE‐590 trial analyzed a separate population of patients with gastroesophageal junction cancer, and there are some differences in response to drugs by tissue type. Therefore, The efficacy of Pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy in the only patient population with gastroesophageal junction cancer warrants further investigation.},

abstract = {IASLC Abstract for Presentation. By Rachel Thomas This panel session will focus on emerging immunotherapies, the aim is to bring the UK perspective to the panel particularly focusing on the role of the Lung Cancer Clinical Nurse Specialist (CNS) and how to support and counsel patients who are about to commence one of the new therapy combinations. The presentation from the UK will look at the current therapies in immunotherapy and then also look at two case studies which will bring the clinical trial data into real time perspective. In the UK there have been no new immunotherapies launched, however, what the landscape of immunotherapies is changing in the UK for non‐small cell lung cancer patients in the form of multi‐drug combinations. Most recently we have seen the introduction of Durvalumab as a treatment for locally advanced unresectable non‐small cell lung cancer post platinum based chemoradiation (1). This combination is still awaiting formal NICE approval but NHS patients can access this via a Cancer Drugs Fund. The PACIFIC Trial demonstrated that patients who received Durvalumab after platinum based chemoradiation had a significant improvement in their progression free survival when compared to chemoradiation plus a placebo. The median duration of progression free survival was 17.2 months in the Durvalumab arm compared to 5.6 months in the placebo arm. The median time to death or distant metastases was 28.3 months in the Durvalumab arm compared to 16.2 months in the placebo arm (2). In the advanced metastatic setting there has recently been the introduction of the KEYNOTE‐189 data which is looking at pembrolizamab + platinum/pemetrexed in patients who did not have any molecular mutations. This trial demonstrated an overall survival with a 51% reduction in the risk of death and superior progression free with a 48% reduction in the risk of progression or death. In March 2019 The IMpower150 trial showed significant improvements in progression‐free and overall survival with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab plus carboplatin plus paclitaxel (ABCP) versus the standard‐of‐care bevacizumab plus carboplatin plus paclitaxel (BCP) in chemotherapy‐naive patients with non‐squamous metastatic non‐small‐cell lung cancer who have an ALK rearrangement or who have an EGFR mutation. This combination has now been approved by NICE and will provide patients who progress on a tyrosine kinase inhibitor a multi‐drug treatment combination which has been demonstrated in the Impower 150 trial to deliver overall survival of around 19.2 months when compared to bevacizumab/carboplatin and paclitaxel. The UK has demonstrated the importance of the input of the Lung Cancer CNS in supporting patients who are about to commence treatment and also in proactively monitoring patients for potential adverse events (3). However, with the emergence of multidrug treatments how do we as Lung Cancer CNS’s assess which adverse events are related to the immunotherapy and which are related to the chemotherapy. Looking at the current clinical trial data from the studies above and then focusing on two real life patient case studies will provide some clear guidance on how to support patients whilst monitoring for any potential adverse events and dealing with these in a timely and accurate manner. The table below sets out just some of the main challenges faced in identifying immunotherapy related adverse events. [Figure presented] We as nurse specialists are now experienced at caring for patients on single agent immunotherapy treatments but one of the many challenges is that many lung cancer patients will have co‐morbidities which can cloud the identification of immunotherapy adverse events. For example 40‐70% of lung cancer patients will also have a diagnosis of COPD. Pneumonitis can present in a very similar pattern to organising pneumonia and chest infections meaning that accurate and detailed assessments are needed to ensure adverse events are identified and treated accordingly. However, when you also add into the treatment plan platinum doublet chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy the potential for adverse events increases, the panel will look at the PACIFIC data to assess the reporting of adverse events in this patient group. The panel will also then assess the trial data for platimum doublet chemotherapy and immunotherapy in the treatment of metastatic non‐small cell lung cancer and whether this patient group with a potentially higher symptom burden reported an increase in the number of adverse events when compared to either single agent immunotherapy or platinum doublet chemotherapy alone. One other important focus of the panel discussion will be to look at what the future treatment landscape for patients may be and how this will impact on progression free survival and living with lung cancer. This will mainly cover recent updates from ASCO and will aim to provide a flavour of what we may see coming into clinical practice in the coming months.

abstract = {Radical radiotherapy is used as definitive therapy in locally advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (LA‐NSCLC), either alone or in combination with chemotherapy and/or surgery. However, definitive doses of radiotherapy are associated with potential toxicity related to the organs at risk (OAR). The major OAR’s related to radical radiotherapy for LA‐NSCLC include the lung and esophagus. Therefore, we need to be able to identify and manage radiation pneumonitis and esophagitis during and after a course of definitive radiotherapy. For good performance status, unresectable stage III NSCLC, radical radiotherapy is delivered either concurrently or sequentially with chemotherapy to total doses of 60Gy or higher. Although the best outcomes have been obtained with concurrent chemoradiotherapy, higher rates of toxicity have also been observed. With the advent of the establishment of adjuvant durvalumab after definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy, the management of pneumonitis in particular has become even more of a challenge given the potential overlapping toxicities. For poorer performance status patients, radical radiotherapy may be used alone. For resectable patients with LA‐NSCLC, radical radiotherapy can be given concurrently with chemotherapy prior to surgical resection as part of trimodality therapy. In other instances, radical radiotherapy can be given adjuvantly post‐operatively for positive margins and can be considered in pathological N2 disease. Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation (PCI) has also been delivered in LA‐NSCLC, although mostly in clinical trials as PCI has not been established as part of routine standard of care in stage III NSCLC. In this session, a discussion as well as case presentations will be used to illustrate how to identify and manage the above toxicities in stage III NSCLC. References (max 10) Baker S, Fairchild A.

abstract = {Gastric Cancer (GC) is the fifth most common malignancy globally and the third leadingcause of cancer death. Half of the world's cases occur in eastern Asia [1], which has thehighest mortality rate. According to the latest data released by the National TumorRegistration Center, it is estimated that in 2015, there were 679,000 new cases ofgastric cancer in China, and 498,000 deaths, ranking second in both incidence andfatality rate among malignant tumors [2]. The overall prognosis is poor, posing a seriousthreat to human health.Environmental and genetic factors play an important role in the development of gastriccancer, with common risk factors including age, male gender, smoking, radiation andfamily history. Specific risk factors for gastric cancer include Helicobacter pyloriinfection and dietary factors [3]. Helicobacter pylori (H.pylori) infection often leadsto chronic gastritis, gastric atrophy, and then intestinal metaplasia, abnormalhyperplasia and gastric cancer [4‐6]. Dietary factors include low intake of fruits andvegetables, high salt, and intake of smoked foods.Radical surgical resection is still the main treatment for non‐metastatic gastric cancer,but the postoperative recurrence and metastasis rate is as high as 40‐80%, and the 5‐yearsurvival rate is 30‐60%[7‐8]. The treatment mode of neoadjuvant chemotherapy + surgery +adjuvant chemotherapy (perioperative treatment) is an important part of the comprehensivetreatment of gastric cancer at present. A number of studies have proved that comparedwith surgery alone, this treatment mode can reduce the tumor stage, increase the R0resection rate, and improve the overall survival, without increasing postoperativecomplications and mortality. The purpose of neoadjuvant chemotherapy is to reduce tumorload and increase the possibility of R0 resection [9], so as to improve the pathologicalcomplete response rate. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy can measure a patient's sensitivity tochemotherapy drugs and therefore predict a patient's response to subsequent chemotherapy.At present, it has been confirmed that pathological complete response rate is correlatedwith overall survival [10]. On September 28, 2019, at the ESMO Conference , Chinesescholars announced the results of the RESOLVE Phase III study on perioperative treatmentof locally advanced gastric cancer [11], adding new evidence‐based medical evidence forperioperative treatment of such patients. The RESOLVE study is A three‐arm, randomized,multicenter, open‐label Phase III trial comparing the efficacy and safety of using XELOX(Group A) or SOX (Group B) after radical D2 surgery versus perioperative use of SOX(group C). Finally, 1022 cases of ITT population were included in the analysis. In theperioperative group (group C), the R0 resection rate (92.88%) and the proportion of D2lymph node dissection (95.59%) showed an increasing trend. The R0 removal rates of groupA and group B were 86.47% and 87.83%, respectively. In patients with locally advancedgastric cancer, SOX chemotherapy during perioperative period improved 3‐year disease‐freesurvival (62.02% vs 54.78%, P=0.045, HR=0.79, 95%CI 0.62‐0.99) compared with XELOXadjuvant. Results of a multicenter Phase III clinical study in France [12] showed thatpreoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy with PF regimen significantly increased R0resection rate compared with surgery alone (84% vs 73%, P=0.04). For initially treatedlocally advanced gastroesophageal cancer, XELOX regimen has been proven to be aseffective as cisplatin combined with fluorouracil regimen [13]. Results of a Chinesestudy showed that for patients with advanced gastric cancer, the ORR of neoadjuvantchemotherapy with FOLFOX regimen was 70%[14], and the R0 resection rate was significantlyimproved compared with surgery alone (86% vs 55%, P=0.011). A study from Japan showed[15] that neoadjuvant chemotherapy with SP protocol is safe and effective for stage IIand III gastric cancer with lymph node metastasis, with ORR of 75.5% and R0 removal rateof 87.8%. Chinese researchers have found [16] that SOX neoadjuvant application inadvanced gastric cancer has an ORR of 68.5%, and the R0 removal rate is alsosignificantly higher than that of operation alone (81.3%vs 73.5%, P=0.040). The resultsof the recent FLOT4 study [17] showed that the perioperative regimen of 5‐fluorouracil +docetaxel + oxaliplatin + calcium folinate (FLOT) was superior to the perioperativeregimen of epirubicin + cisplatin + 5‐fluorouracil or capecitabine (ECF/ECX) in terms ofR0 removal rate (85% vs 78%). P=0.0162).At present, the recommended preoperative chemotherapy for gastric cancer mainly includes:Epirubicin combined with Cisplatin and fluorouracil (ECF) and its modification, cisplatincombined with fluorouracil (PF), oxaliplatin combined with capecitabine (XELOX),oxaliplatin combined with fluorouracil (FOLFOX), Cisplatin combined with S‐1 (SP),oxaliplatin combined with S‐1 (SOX), FLOT (5‐fluorouracil + docetaxel + oxaliplatin +calcium folinate).As a highly heterogeneous malignant tumor, gastric cancer is an extremely complex processin which the immune microenvironment plays an important role, and the inhibitory immunemicroenvironment and immune escape have received more and more attention. programmeddeath receptor‐1 (PD‐1) and programmed death ligand‐1 (PD‐L1) belong to the B7/CD28superfamily and are very important negative co‐stimulatory molecules discovered in recentyears. It can negatively regulate the activity of immune cells [18]. PD‐1 is the mainimmunosuppressive molecule on the surface of T cells and B cells. PD‐1 has two ligands,PD‐L1 and PD‐L2. PD‐L1 is widely expressed in activated T cells, B cells, macrophages,dendritic cells, and tumor cells. PD‐L1 expressed by tumor cells and PD‐1 expressed bytumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TILs) (mainly CD8+T cells) bind to activate thePD‐1/PD‐L1 signaling pathway and inhibit the activation of tumor infiltratinglymphocytes. Reduced T cell reactivity leads to T cell incapacitated, induces T cellapoptosis, provides a suitable microenvironment for the development of tumor cells,mediates tumor immune escape, and promotes tumor growth [19]. Blocking the PD‐1/PD‐L1signaling pathway can reverse the tumor immune microenvironment and enhance theendogenous anti‐tumor immune effect. PD‐L1 is highly expressed in various solid malignanttumors [20‐21], including non‐small cell lung cancer, melanoma, renal cell carcinoma,prostate cancer, breast cancer, stomach cancer, etc., and its expression level variesaccording to different tumor types. At present, the relationship between PD‐L1 expressionand prognosis in gastric cancer is still controversial.In December 2018, the Phase II trial results of the Asian Attract‐04 study [22] werepublished. The study was designed to explore the safety and efficacy of Nivolumab incombination with SOX (Ticeo and oxaliplatin) or XELOX (capecitabine and oxaliplatin) infirst‐line treatment of advanced, unresectable, or recurrent gastric/gastroesophagealjunctional adenocarcinoma. The randomized ratio was 1:1, and the median OS follow‐up wasnot reached in the FAS population (NR (11.9, NR) and NR (11.2, NR), respectively). MedianPFS were 9.7 months (5.8‐NR) and 10.6 months (5.6‐12.5), respectively. The ORR ofNivolumab combined with SOX was 57.1%, and that of Nivolumab combined with XELOX was76.5%.In March 2019, the results of KEYNOTE‐059 study [23] Cohort 2 and cohort 3 Phase IIclinical trials were published. The study cohort 2 and cohort 3 were designed to explorethe safety and efficacy of Pembrolizumab± chemotherapy in first‐line treatment ofadvanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma. In cohort 2, 25 patientsreceived Pembrolizumab combined with chemotherapy. All patients had an ORR of 60.0%,including 73.3% ORR in the PD‐LI positive group and 37.5% ORR in the PD‐LI negativegroup, with a median OS of 13.8 months (8.6‐NR). The median PFS was 6.6 months(5.9‐10.6). In cohort 3, 31 PD‐L1 positive (CPS≥1) patients who received Pembrolizumabmonotherapy had an ORR of 25.8%, a median OS of 20.7 months (9.2‐20.7), and a median PFSof 3.3 months.At the American Society of Clinical Oncology Symposium (ASCO) in June 2019, Merckpresented the results of the KEYMAT‐062 Phase III study [24], which randomized untreatedPD‐L1‐positive advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma into threegroups, group 1 being Pembrolizumab monotherapy (Group P). Pembrolizumab combined withchemotherapy in group 2 (P+C) and placebo combined with chemotherapy in group 3 (C) hadprimary endpoints of PFS in people with PD‐L1 CPS≥1 and OS in people with PD‐L1 CPS≥1 andCPS≥10. The results suggest that Pembrolizumab combined with chemotherapy is not superiorto chemotherapy for OS and PFS in any population. From the perspective of ORR alone, inpatients with CPS≥1, the ORR in group P vs group C vs group P+C was 14.8% vs 37.2% vs48.6%; In patients with CPS≥10, the ORR in group P vs C vs P+C was 25.0% vs 37.8%vs52.8%. In terms of safety, the P vs C group had better safety, with the incidence of anygrade of AE in the P+C vs C group being 94% vs 92%, and the incidence of grade 3‐4 TRAEbeing 71% vs 68%, with no unexpected adverse events.On November 5, 2022, at the CSCO Annual Meeting, Professor Huang Jing reported on theresearch related to the treatment of advanced esophageal cancer with Srulizumab ‐ASTRO‐007: In the whole population, the median PFS in the srulizumab and placebo groupswas 5.8 months vs5.3 months (HR=0.60, P < 0.0001), and the median OS was 15.3 months vs11.8 months (HR=0.68, P=0.0020). Among those with PD‐L1 CPS≥10, the median PFS for bothgroups was 7.1 months vs 5.3 months (HR=0.48, P < 0.0001), and the median OS was 18.6months vs 13.9 months (HR=0.59, P=0.0082). The study also confirmed the significance ofsrulizumab combined with chemotherapy in the first‐line treatment of advanced esophagealcancer, especially in those with CPS > 10.In other cancers, such as triple negative breast cancer and head and neck squamous cellcarcinoma, Pembrolizumab combined with neoadjuvant chemotherapy has shown promisingantitumor activity and clinical efficacy. At present, immunotherapy is also beingexplored in the perioperative period of gastric cancer, such as the phase III clinicalstudy of KEYKEYNOTE 585 perioperative chemotherapy for gastric cancer combined with orwithout PD‐1 inhibitor, and the clinical study of mFOLFOX combined with PD‐1 inhibitorfor the treatment of gastroesophageal conjoint adenocarcinoma or gastric adenocarcinomain perioperative period (NCT03488667), etc. In order to provide a new clinical thinkingfor the treatment of locally advanced gastric cancer.This is a multicenter, double‐blind, randomized, phase 2 trial to investigate theefficacy and safety of serlulimab combined with nab‐paclitaxel plus SOX versusnab‐paclitaxel plus SOX alone as neoadjuvant treatment for locally advanced GC or AEG.The goal of this clinical trial is to learn if serlulimab combined with nab‐paclitaxelplus SOX as neoadjuvant treatment for locally advanced AEG/GC.},

abstract = {Background: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized the treatment landscape for locally advanced non‐small‐cell lung cancer (LA‐NSCLC), whereas responses to anti‐programmed cell death‐1 (PD‐1) or anti‐programmed death‐ligand 1 (PD‐L1) are heterogeneous. Though consolidation ICI following concurrent chemoradiotherapy (cCRT) improves survival of NSCLC, this regimen is challenging for patients with bulky tumors due to excessive target volumes and radiation‐resistant hypoxia during upfront cCRT, leading to higher risk of pneumonitis and inferior local‐regional control. Recent trials have demonstrated neoadjuvant ICI brought greater benefit to stage III than stage I‐II NSCLC. Our previous study also supported the therapeutic advantage of 2‐cycle induction ICI for patients with bulky unresectable stage III NSCLC. In the context of induction immunotherapy, radiotherapy is more likely to exert immune synergistic effects, reverse anti‐PD‐1 resistance, and activate abscopal immune responses. Prospective trials to determine the efficacy and safety of induction ICI for bulky LA‐NSCLC are necessary. Methods: This randomized, open‐label, two‐arm phase II study aims to explore whether 2 cycles of induction anti‐PD‐1 toripalimab plus chemotherapy can improve progression‐free survival (PFS) in bulky LA‐NSCLC. Bulky tumors are defined as primary lesion ≥5 cm in greatest dimension or metastatic lymph nodes ≥2 cm in shortest diameter. A total of 50 patients with bulky unresectable stage III NSCLC will be recruited and 1:1 randomized into the experimental arm: 2‐cycle induction PD‐1 inhibitor toripalimab plus chemotherapy followed by cCRT and consolidation toripalimab; or control arm: 2‐cycle induction chemotherapy followed by cCRT and consolidation toripalimab. Patients are stratified by pathology (squamous versus non‐squamous). The primary endpoint is PFS. Secondary endpoints are overall survival, overall response rate, disease control rate, duration of response, and incidence of adverse events. Exploratory analyses include PD‐L1 expression and liquid biopsy‐based biomarker testing, tumor microenvironment profiling at single‐cell levels, and quality‐of‐life assessments. Discussion: The InTRist study is the first randomized phase II trial to investigate the feasibility of induction anti‐PD‐1 toripalimab plus chemotherapy followed by cCRT and consolidation toripalimab in bulky LA‐NSCLC, providing novel evidence for the synergistic strategy combining anti‐PD‐1 blockade with radiotherapy to prolong immunotherapy benefits, overcome resistance, and enhance abscopal immune response.

abstract = {Background Despite multimodality standard therapy, patients (pts) with resectable locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) are at high risk for locoregional and distant recurrence. Although induction chemotherapy followed by surgery and postoperative radiotherapy did not show improved overall survival (OS) in 2 phase III trials of pts with resectable oral cancer, pts with pathologic complete response (pCR) and/or major pathologic response (MCR) had improved progression free survival (PFS) and OS [1,2]. In addition, major tumor responses may decrease surgical morbidity and reduce postoperative radiation fields [2]. Therefore, induction regimens which improve pCR/ MCR rates may improve survival and morbidity. PD‐1 checkpoint inhibitors, nivolumab and pembrolizumab, are established in recurrent or metastatic SCCHN as 2nd line therapy. In a randomized phase III in 1st‐line advanced nonsquamous non‐small cell lung cancer, carboplatin plus pemetrexed plus pembrolizumab improved clinical response, PFS, and OS compared to chemotherapy alone. We hypothesize that pts with newly diagnosed, previously untreated SCCHN, induction nivolumab in combination with weekly carboplatin and paclitaxel will increase the pCR rate at the primary cancer compared to the historical control chemotherapy alone. Methods This is an investigator‐initiated trial for pts with newly diagnosed (AJCC 8th) stage III or IV HPV negative and stage III HPV positive SCCHN (oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx) who are surgical candidates. Pts receive induction with carboplatin AUC IV Q1 wk x 6 plus paclitaxel 100 mg/m2 IV Q1 wk x 6 with nivolumab 240mg IV Q2 wks x 3, all beginning on day 1 with surgery wk 8. The primary objective is pCR at the primary site.

abstract = {Background: Chemoradiotherpay plus immunotherapy is recommended for unresectable locally‐advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) based on PACIFIC trial. However, it is unclear whether surgery can provide survival benefit for patients with tumors initially unresectable transformed into resectable ones after chemoimmunotherapy. This trial aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of the therapeutic regimen of chemoimmunotherapy plus surgery or radiotherapy. Methods: Patients with unresectable stage IIIB‐IIIC NSCLC were enrolled to receive 4 cycles (q21d) of PD‐1 antibody (Serplulimab, 4.5mg/kg) and platinumbased doublet chemotherapy. After the induction therapy, those with disease downstaged to IIIA or lower stage and resectable were randomized to receive radical surgery or radiotherapy with a ratio of 1:1, and those with stage IIIB or higher stage or unresectable disease after induction therapy were then treated by oncologists. Primary endpoint was event‐free survival (EFS). Secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR), major pathologic response (MPR), pathologic complete response (pCR), progression‐free survival (PFS), disease‐free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS), R0 rate of resection, severe adverse event (SAE) rate, and health related quality of life (HRQol). Preliminary short‐term results were collected. Results: One hundred patients will be enrolled as planned, and a total of 82 patients were enrolled by the data cutoff date (January 6, 2024). Fifty‐four and 28 patients were diagnosed with stage IIIB and IIIC disease, respectively. The percentage of squamous carcinomas, adenocarcinomas, and NSCLCs not otherwise specified were 68.3% (56/82), 15.9% (13/82), and 15.9% (13/82), respectively. ORR in 73 evaluable patients was 74.0% (54/73). Twenty‐six of them are still in induction therapy phase, and the other 47 and 9 patients received 4 cycles and 1‐3 cycles of induction therapy, respectively. Thirty‐one patients had downstaged and resectable disease after 4 cycles of induction therapy, and 26 of them were randomized to arm A (n = 13) and arm B (n = 13), and 5 refused randomization (3 received surgery). One patient received surgery after 2 cycles of induction therapy. In 56 patients finished 1‐4 cycles of induction therapy, the rate of conversion to resectability was 57.1% (32/56). In total, 17 patients received surgery, and the MPR and pCR rate in 16 evaluable patients were 62.5% (10/16) and 31.3% (5/16), respectively. The grade 3‐5 adverse event rate in 56 patients finished induction therapy was 50.0% (28/56). One patient died of immune‐related pneumonia. Conclusions: Induction therapy with PD‐1 antibody (Serplulimab) and chemotherapy could transform half of unresectable stage IIIB‐IIIC NSCLC into resectable, and the efficacy and safety were satisfactory.},

abstract = {Background Several real‐world experiences have been reported safety and effectiveness of Durvalumab after concurrent or sequential chemo‐radiotherapy (ChT‐RT) in lLA‐NSCLC patients. There is a lack of data after sequential ChT‐hypofractionated RT. In single arm phase II trial (NCT05291780) we assessed local control (LC) and safety of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SAbR) in unresectable LA‐NSCLC patients unfit for concurrent ChT‐RT (1). Here we report clinical outcomes of SAbR in LA‐NSCLC patients treated with radical‐intent based on PACIFIC trial. Methods Between December 31, 2015 and June 30, 2022 71 LA‐NSCLC patients were enrolled. 40 (56%) fit patients received neoadjuvant ChT and 15 (37%) received Durvalumab. The tumor volume included primary tumor (T) and any regionally positive node/s (N). The co‐primary study endpoints were LC and safety. Results The median age was 71 years (range, 52–78). Histology was adenocarcinoma (ADC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and in 9 (60%) and 6 (40%), respectively. The stage was IIIA, IIIB and IIIC in 7 (47%), 5 (33%) and 3 (20%) patients, respectively. Median prescribed dose was 45 Gy (range, 40–50) and 40 Gy (35–50) in 5 daily fractions to T and N, respectively. After a median follow‐up of 16 months (range, 6–62), 4 (27%) patients had experienced local recurrence (LR) at a median time of 13 months (range, 7–34). The median LR‐free survival (FS) was 34 months (95% CI, 14 to 34). The 1‐, 2‐ and 4‐year LR‐FS rates were 92 ± 8%, 72 ± 14% and 48 ± 22%, respectively. At last follow‐up, 23 (58%) patients were alive. Median overall survival (OS) was 50 months (95% CI, 31–55). The 1, 2, and 4‐year OS rates were 92 ± 5%, 70 ± 8% and 51 ± 9%, respectively. 7 patients had disease recurrence, 4 and 3 during and after completion of Durvalumab. 2(13%) discontinued Durvalumab due to G3 toxicity. Conclusions SABR and immunotherapy can be the backbone of patients unfit to concurrent ChT‐RT. Our early outcomes would suggest the feasibility of using this approach in LA‐NSCLC patients unfit for concurrent ChT‐RT.

abstract = {Despite advances in the treatment of non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) over the past several decades, only small incremental overall survival benefits have been demonstrated. Although historically not considered immunogenic, lung cancer has emerged as an exciting new target for immune‐oncology, which uses the unique properties of the immune system to fight cancer. As more is learnt about the biology of lung cancer, the importance of T cells is becoming increasingly clear. The role of T cells is important as part of the adaptive immune response as they specifically target tumour antigens and induce immunological memory. These responses by T cells are regulated through a complex balance of inhibitory 'checkpoints' and activating signals. Deregulation of this process is one way that cancers evade the immune system. Vaccination strategies have failed to provide any clinical benefit in early disease after radical surgery (MAGEA3 antigen, MAGRIT trial), in consolidation after radiochemotherapy for stage III disease (Stimuvax®, START trial) or alternatively in the advanced disease setting (Lucanix™). Taking into account that well conducted large phase III randomized trials were negative despite the identification and the use of potent specific antigens in efficiently manufactured vaccines, such peptide/cellular based vaccines are not considered anymore as a promising potent tool against lung cancer when used as monotherapy. Proof‐of‐ concept for immunotherapy has been provided later by the approval of anti‐CTLA‐4 antibody, ipilimumab, for the treatment of patients with advanced melanoma. More recently, anti‐PD‐1/PD‐L1 agents have been shown to be a promising strategy in the management of various cancers, including lung cancer. Immunotherapy studies continue to improve our understanding of the immune system. A number of ongoing trials with immune checkpoint inhibitors, including anti‐PD‐1, anti‐PD‐L1 and anti‐CTLA‐4 agents have shown encouraging activity with the potential for long‐term survival and a manageable safety profile. These clinical benefits have been demonstrated in multiple lines of NSCLC therapy across a range of patient populations, regardless of tumour histology or mutational status. Importantly, the first large randomized trials in second line treatment of NSCLC have shown a very significant survival benefit of nivolumab as compared to docetaxel in squamous as well in non‐squamous unselected patients. The benefit of such approach is probably greater than the benefit of the introduction of second line chemotherapy versus placebo more than a decade ago. An important aspect of immunotherapy in lung cancer‐but also in other cancer types‐is the hope for long‐term benefit and “a plateau” effect regarding advanced disease patients survival, observed quite consistently accross all clinical trails. These two trials have thereafter defined a new standard of care and introduced immunotherapy in our guidelines and algorithms. Additionally, very encouraging early results are emerging in 2015 regarding the treatment of mesothelioma as well as small‐cell lung cancer. Lastly, the unique mechanism of action of immune‐oncology therapies also offers the opportunity for these agents to be combined with conventional treatments. These combinations have the potential to further improve clinical outcomes for patients with NSCLC and overcome resistance to targeted treatments.},

abstract = {The standard treatment for locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (LA‐SCCHN) is surgery ± postoperative (chemo)radiation therapy [(C)RT] or definitive CRT. The standard concurrent chemotherapy regimen is tri‐weekly cisplatin. In the postoperative setting, weekly cisplatin is an alternative option. For laryngeal preservation, induction docetaxel, cisplatin, and 5‐FU followed by (C)RT is the treatment option. Recently, the efficacy of combined immunotherapy and CRT for curative intent has been reported. In the PACIFIC trial, definitive CRT followed by durvalumab significantly improved survival compared to placebo in non‐small cell lung cancer. In the CHECKMATE 577 study, nivolumab following neoadjuvant CRT plus surgery improved survival outcomes compared to placebo in esophageal or gastroesophageal junction cancer. On the other hand, in the JAVELIN head & neck 100 study, which examined the additive effect of avelumab to CRT for LA‐SCCHN, avelumab did not prolong progression‐free survival compared to the placebo. The GORETEC 2015‐01 trial compared the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab + RT with cetuximab + RT in patients unfit for receiving high‐dose cisplatin. Compared to the cetuximab group, the pembrolizumab group did not improve locoregional control and survival outcomes. The KEYNOTE‐412 trial is currently underway to determine whether pembrolizumab should be added to standard CRT. The IMvoke010 study is also underway to evaluate the efficacy of atezolizumab as adjuvant therapy after definitive local therapy. The ongoing KEYNOTE‐689 trial evaluates the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab as neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy in combination with adjuvant RT ± cisplatin. Xevinapant is an antagonist of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins. In a randomized PII trial, xevinapant with the standard CRT improved locoregional control and survival outcomes compared to placebo. The confirmatory PIII Trilynx trial is ongoing.},

abstract = {Stage III non‐small cell lung cancer accounts for heterogeneous group of diseases, due to differences in tumor size, location number of nodes involved, and lymph node station involved. Stage III non‐small cell lung cancer comprises 2 distinct stages, stage IIIA and IIIB disease that have different prognosis, and are usually treated differently. Approximately 15% of all patients with newly diagnosed non‐small cell lung cancer present with stage III disease. Options for stage III non‐small cell lung cancer include surgery, with lobectomy or pneumonectomy depending on the tumor stage, and lymph node involvement. Chemotherapy may be administered in the neoadjuvant, concurrent or adjuvant setting. Radiation therapy can be given in a concurrent, sequential approach, or may be administered in the postoperative fashion. Combination approaches are often used, and due to the significant need of multi‐modality therapy, treatment decisions are usually made in a multidisciplinary setting. The optimal therapeutic approach for patients with stage IIIA non‐small cell lung cancer remains controversial. For subset of patients with T3 to T4 N0‐1 disease, and superior sulcus location, surgery remains a viable and preferred option. However, the optimal treatment for patients with stage III A, with bulky lymph node involvement, or multi station lymph node involvement including N2 disease, remains an area of ongoing controversy. Tri‐modality approaches using preoperative chemotherapy, or upfront chemoradiation therapy followed by surgery have been evaluated (1). For patients with surgically unresectable, or medically inoperable disease, concurrent chemoradiation therapy has been established as the standard of care for patients spanning the spectrum of stage IIIA and IIIB disease. Recently, the PACIFIC trial demonstrated an improvement in progression free survival and overall survival with the administration of durvalumab as consolidation therapy (regardless of PDL‐1 status) for patients who had not progressed after 2 or more cycles of definitive concurrent platinum‐based chemoradiation therapy (2, 3). This approach represents a new paradigm in the management of unresectable NSCLC, and has now been adopted as standard of care. Management of Stage III patients with non EGFR oncogene addicted tumors is an area of active research. ALK or ROS directed oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are not typically administered in the adjuvant setting outside of a clinical trial. There are several trials evaluating the use of targeted therapies. ALINA, is one such trial, that is a phase III study of alectinib versus chemotherapy as adjuvant therapy in patients with stage IB–IIIA anaplastic lymphoma kinase‐positive ALK positive NSCLC (4). Another study is comparing adjuvant alectinib versus adjuvant platinum‐based chemotherapy in patients with ALK positive NSCLC, here the alectinib is administered for 2 years (NCT 03456076). The Adjuvant Lung Cancer Enrichment Marker Identification and Sequencing (ALCHEMIST) trial is actively enrolling patients with operable NSCLC and will perform genetic screening of their tumors. Patients with EGFR mutation or ALK gene rearrangement in their tumor will be randomized to placebo versus erlotinib or crizotinib, respectively (NCT02194738). We await the results of these trials prior to routine incorporation of molecularly directed therapy in the management of locally advanced disease. References: 1.

abstract = {Background: Combination checkpoint inhibition has clinical activity in various tumor types. A phase I trial of nivolumab and ipilimumab in advanced NSCLC demonstrated encouraging activity and manageable toxicity. Irradiation provides palliative and local responses in NSCLC. Increasing evidence suggests that apart from its direct effects, radiotherapy and particularly ablative hypofractionated radiotherapy can act as a trigger for the innate and adaptive immune system termed the abscopal effect. The balance of signals (pro‐immunogenic and immunosuppressive) may determine the effectiveness of both systemic antitumor immune responses and local tumor cell killing. Direct tumor debulking by radiation may also be particularly well suited as an adjunct to immunotherapy. In addition, immunotherapy after RT has demonstrated survival benefit. Methods: This is a phase I study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of combination nivolumab (3 mg/kg every 2 weeks), ipilimumab (1 mg/kg every 6 weeks), and sequential or concurrent SBRT in patients with stage IV NSCLC. Patients will be simultaneously accrued to sequential versus concurrent arms in a randomized 1:1 fashion as first‐line therapy. Eligibility criteria include EGFR/ALK negative stage IV disease with PS 0‐1. The primary outcome is the safest SBRT dose to various metastatic locations delivered prior to or concurrently with nivolumab and ipilimumab. Metastatic locations include 1)peripheral lung, 2)central lung or mediastinal lymph node, 3)liver, 4)osseous, and 5)abdominal/pelvic with doses ranging 30‐50 Gy in 3‐5 fractions. Secondary outcomes include toxicity, response rate, progression free survival, tumor microenvironment changes, and immunogenicity of combination therapy. Patients will undergo biopsies pre‐ and post‐SBRT to provide insight into the mechanism of the radiation‐induced pro‐inflammatory microenvironment. The total sample size will include 40‐80 patients depending on the number who contribute to multiple metastatic sites. Twenty patients per randomized arm will be needed to assess the initial starting dose. Results: Trial in progress.},

abstract = {Background: In the phase 3, placebo‐controlled PACIFIC trial of patients with unresectable, stage III non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) without disease progression after concurrent chemoradiotherapy, consolidative durvalumab was associated with significant improvements in the overall survival (OS) and progression‐free survival (PFS). Based on these results, durvalumab become the new standard of care for patients with locally advanced NSCLC who didn't progress on concomitant chemoradiotherapy. In this work we present the real world results of consolidation immunotherapy with durvalumab in patients with PD‐L1 expression positive stage III NSCLC in the Department of Oncology, University Hospital of Split. Methods: This retrospective analysis included 26 patients with PD‐L1 expression positive stage III NSCLC who were treated with concomitant chemoradiotherapy and there were no signs of disease progression on control lung CT, and who received at least one cycle of durvalumab in the period from 2018‐ 2021. First cycle of durvalumab had to be applied within 42 days from the last radiotherapy fraction. Durvalumab dose was 10 mg/kg every two weeks. Maximal treatment duration was one year. Results: Out of 26 included patients there were 19 men and 7 women. Median patient's age was 67,5 years. Squamous cell carcinoma was present in 17 patients (65%) and 9 patients (35%) had adenocarcinoma. PD‐L1 tumor‐membrane expression was as follows: 1‐49% in 18 patients (70%), 50% or more in 8 patients (30%). The median number of administered cycles of durvalumab was 14 (range 1‐25). The median PFS was 11 months. The median OS was not reached (at the time of analysis 16 patients (61,5%) were alive). The objective response rate on durvalumab was 34,6%. Stable disease was the best response to therapy in 12 patients (46%), disease progression was observed in 4 patients (15%), while 1 patient (3%) had not yet undergone control diagnostic procedure. Sites of disease progression on durvalumab were: intrathoracic in 4 patients and extrathoracal in 4 patients ‐ brain and bones in 3 patients and kidney in one patient. The immune‐related adverse events were observed in 13 patients (50%): hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism grade 1‐2 in 8 patients (30%), pneumonitis grade 1‐2 in 2 patients, rash grade 1 in one patient and creatine kinase elevation grade 2 in one patient. In one patient there were hepatitis grade 2 and that was the reason for treatment discontinuation. Conclusion: Treatment with durvalumab in patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC without disease progression after concurrent chemoradiotherapy in our institution was effective and well tolerated. To draw firm conclusions and to compare it with results from registrational study longer follow up and larger sample size are needed.},

abstract = {Despite the many challenges faced in 2020, we have seen impressive progress in many areas of cancer research. Twenty‐one novel oncology drugs were approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Although cancer is one of the major public health problems worldwide, cancer mortality projections for 2021 confirm the persistent declines in cancer mortality in EU and US for many specific cancers. The breast cancer treatment landscape has evolved in the past year and several new drugs approved in 2020 as antibody drugs conjugates (ADC) sacituzumab in TNBC and fam‐trastuzumab deruxtecan‐nxki (T‐DXd) in metastatic HER2 positive BC, as well as tucatinib, a small kinase inhibitor. A few very important clinical trial /RxPONDER, ADAPT, PRIME II/ presented last year support de‐escalation of adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation, sparing patients from some of the side effects that can accompany treatments. In ovarian cancer five‐year follow‐up data from the SOLO‐1 trial continue to show progression‐free survival benefit of olaparib as maintenance therapy following platinum‐based chemotherapy in the frontline setting. In the final analysis of SOLO‐2 trial, maintenance olaparib provided an improvement of 12.9 months in median OS vs placebo in women with relapsed BRCA‐related ovarian cancer who had responded to their most recent platinum‐based chemotherapy after having received at least one more line of chemotherapy.In 2020 first new treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma approved in more than ten years according to the data from phase III IMbrave 150 trial. In that study, which includes 501 patients the combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab provides the longest survival seen in a front‐line phase III study in advanced HCC, confirming atezo + bev as a standard of care for previously untreated, unresectable HCC.In the field of thoracic oncology there were some very important news in 2020, potentially practice changing. Osimertinib, next generation EGFR‐TKI, standard first line therapy in metastatic EGFR‐mutated advanced NSCLC was successfully used, in ADAURA study, in adjuvant setting vs placebo (planned treatment duration three years), in resected NSCLC patients, stage IB‐IIIA. Patients might had adjuvant chemotherapy also, and there was no outcome differences between these two groups. Overall, there was a 79% reduction in the risk of disease recurrence or death (DFS HR was 0.21, p<0.0001). Lorlatinib is the third generation of ALKinhibitors in the treatment of advanced NSCLC. The results of CROWN study where lorlatinib was given in the first line treatment were presented at ESMO 2020. In this randomized study, comparing lorlatinib with crizotinib, lorlatinib was superior in the term of PFS, HR was 0.28, p<0.001, this superiority was particularly pronounced in intracranial disease, where the percent of intracranial response was 82% in lorlatinib arm and only 23% in crizotinib arm, and percent of complete response per CT was 71% vs 7%. Lorlatinib has been recently approved for patients with advanced ALK‐positive NSCLC, irrespectively of treatment line. Also of interest were two studies that inovatively used immunologic drugs as a combination in advanced NSCLC: in Check Mate 9LA randomized study, cytotoxic chemotherapy was given in paralell with nivolumab + ipilimumab for first two cycles, and compared with four cycles of chemoherapy. Median OS was significantly better: 15.6 vs 10.9 months, HR 0.66 and a overall response rate was 38% vs 25%. CITYSCAPE study give us inovative combination of two immuno‐oncology drugs, tiragolumab as TIGIT inhibitor, and standard atezolizumab. Median PFS was particularly longer in the population of patients with high PD‐L1 expression (NE vs 4.11 months, HR 0.30). In gastrointestinal oncology, last year will be remembered by introducing immunotherapy in first line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer for patients with MSI‐H tumors. In KN177, such patients were randomized to receive pembrolizumab or standard chemotherapy+/‐biologic therapy, and after second interim analysis, there was a very clear adventage for pembrolizumab in terms of mPFS (16.5 vs 8.2 months) and duraton of response (at 24 months, 83% vs 35%). The results are impressive, and it is for expected to be confirmed by OS adventage in future analyses. In urological oncology, JAVELIN Bladder 100 study demonstrated that the maintenance avelumab + best supportive care is superior over best supportive care alone after platinum‐based first‐line chemotherapy in advanced urothelial carcinoma. In overall population, OS was 21.4 vs 14.3 months, HR 0.69, p<0.001, and the results are even better in PD‐L1 positive population, with HR 0.56. These results are very probably practice changing, since cytotoxic chemotherapy have very modest achievements in the field of urothelial cancer.},

abstract = {Background: Around 30% of NSCLC patients (pts) present with stage IB‐IIIA disease. Standard treatment options are definitive locoregional therapies w/wo chemotherapy (CT) and/or immunotherapy, followed by surveillance until disease recurrence. Targeted therapies are standard for metastatic NSCLC with driver alterations and recent Phase III trial data has emerged in support of their use in the adjuvant setting for stage IB‐IIIA (ADAURA and ALINA). RET is a key oncogenic driver in NSCLC and a promising target for adjuvant targeted therapy. Selpercatinib, a highly selective, potent and CNS active RET inhibitor, recently demonstrated longer PFS than platinum‐based CT as 1L treatment in pts with RET+ advanced NSCLC (Zhou et al. NEJM 2023). LIBRETTO‐432 is a Phase 3, global, multicenter, randomized, double‐blind, controlled trial evaluating efficacy and safety of adjuvant selpercatinib v Placebo in pts with RET+ Stage IB‐IIIA NSCLC following completion of definitive therapies with curative intent, and other adjuvant therapy if indicated (NCT04819100). Methods: Pts (n≈170) will be randomized (1:1) to selpercatinib BID [160mg≥50kg; 120mg< 50kg], or Placebo, in continuous 28‐day cycles for a maximum treatment duration of 3y. Stratification factors include disease stage (IB/ II/IIIA) and prior definitive therapy. Treatment will continue until disease recurrence/ progression, unacceptable toxicity, or another protocol‐defined reason. Crossover is allowed for Placebo pts who experience disease recurrence/progression. Key eligibility criteria include age ≥18 y; histologically confirmed Stage IB/II/IIIA NSCLC; RET+ tumor by PCR/NGS; prior definitive locoregional therapy with curative intent (surgery, radiotherapy) for Stage IB/II/IIIA NSCLC; and ECOG performance status 0‐1. Maximum time allowed from definitive therapy completion to randomization is 26 w. Key exclusion criteria are evidence of other known oncogenic drivers; SCLC; and disease recurrence/progression following definitive therapy. Primary endpoint is investigator‐assessed event‐free survival (IAEFS) in the primary analysis population (pts with Stage II‐IIIA). EFS is defined as time from randomization until locoregional disease recurrence with histopathological confirmation, distant disease recurrence per RECIST v1.1 or histopathological confirmation, or death. Gated secondary endpoints include IAEFS in the overall population (pts with Stage IB‐IIIA) and OS in both primary analysis and overall populations. Non‐gated secondary efficacy endpoints include BICR‐assessed EFS, BICR and investigator‐assessed time to distant disease recurrence in the CNS, and PFS on next line of treatment. Recruitment is ongoing, with enrollment across ∼170 sites and 30 countries. Results from this trial will further inform the value of RET inhibition and genomic testing for adjuvant NSCLC pts.},

abstract = {Background: Despite the promise of immunotherapy for the treatment of advanced NSCLC, only a fraction of patients experience significant benefit from immunotherapy alone. Previous studies have shown that SBRT can stimulate innate and adaptive immunity to potentially augment immunotherapy. In addition, SBRT is used in patients with limited metastatic disease as consolidative approach, showing an improvement overall survival when compared to systemic treatment alone. Combining immunotherapy with ablative therapy is being studied by a number of investigators. While many of these pre‐clinical and clinical studies are promising, timing of immunotherapy with SBRT has not be formally studied. Further, few of these studies have addressed treatment of multiple sites of disease and little is known about what molecular changes occur in the tumor microenvironment immediately after ablative therapy. This trial is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination of nivolumab (N) and ipilimumab (I) plus sequential(S) or concurrent(C) SBRT in patients with stage IV NSCLC. Method: This is a single‐center phase I, open‐label, two‐arm, randomized platform trial. Eligible patients include those with stage IV NSCLC with ≥2 metastatic lesions that meet criteria for SBRT (0.2 cc to 65 cc of viable tumor, larger tumors able to be partially treated up to 65 cc). Eligible patients are simultaneously accrued on arm I (S) and arm II (C) in a 1:1 ratio. Participants in arm I complete SBRT to 2‐4 sites followed by initiation of N/I 1‐7 days after completion of SBRT. Participants in arm II are treated with N/I within 24‐48 hours of SBRT with required SBRT completion to 2‐4 sites within two weeks (prior to the second dose of N). Protocol therapy consists of treatment with N 3mg/kg every 2 weeks and I 1mg/kg every 6 weeks for a maximum of 24 months. The primary endpoint is dose‐limiting toxicity defined as a >33% rate of grade ≥3 toxicity. DLT is defined as any grade ≥3 toxicity possibly, likely, or definitely related to SBRT plus N/I (the combination and not the individual components). Secondary endpoints include response rate and progression free survival at 6 months, control rate of treated lesions and non‐treated lesions, and comparison of efficacy and toxicity between the arms. Biopsies and blood draws performed pre‐ and post‐SBRT will facilitate molecular correlative studies including investigation of changes in the immune microenvironment induced by the two approaches. Result: Current enrollment includes 27 of the 40‐80 participants: 15 patients are enrolled on arm 1 (sequential) and 12 patients are enrolled on arm 2 (concurrent). SBRT safety cohorts, to which patients can contribute to more than one, include the following: central lung (n=20), peripheral lung (n=7), abdominal (n=5), osseous (n=9), and liver (n=5). All patients have paired pretreatment and posttreatment biopsies of at least one irradiated lesion. 79% of post‐ablative biopsies are suitable for DNA/RNA sequencing.

abstract = {Purpose or Objective: The standard treatment of locally advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (LA‐NSCLC) has changed with the PACIFIC trial, stating that the addition of 1‐year adjuvant immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy after completed concomitant chemoradiotherapy increases the 2‐year survival rate compared to placebo. Inclusion criteria were a WHO performance status (PS) of 0‐1 and no sign of progression. Adjuvant therapy should start within 42 days of completed chemoradiotherapy. The aim of this analysis was to determine the fraction of patients with LA‐NSCLC that have PS 0‐1 within six weeks after completion of concomitant chemoradiotherapy and would hence be candidates for adjuvant immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Material and Methods: We are currently recruiting patients with LA‐NSCLC in a national multicenter randomized phase III isotoxic dose escalation trial. In the study the control arm receives 66 Gy in 33 fractions concomitantly with cis‐ or carboplatin every third week and fixed dose vinorelbine 50 mg three times weekly. The concomitant chemoradiotherapy is proceeded by a single series of induction platinum‐based combination chemotherapy. Radiotherapy is delivered with intensity modulated or volumetric arc modulated therapy. Daily image guidance with conebeam CT and treatment adaptation guidelines are used. The trial inclusion criteria are cytology or histology proven LA‐NSCLC and PS 0‐1. Diagnostic procedures include FDG‐PET/CT and endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) with aspiration cytology from central mediastinal nodes. We are investigating the possibility of an amendment to allow for adjuvant immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy to enable continuous inclusion in the study. Thus, an unplanned interim analysis was performed within the trial, analyzing only baseline characteristics and PS at the first clinical follow‐up six weeks post radiotherapy. Results Patients were included from January 2015 and forward. Data lock for the interim analysis was September 1st, 2018. 124 patients had completed their treatment and attended their first clinical follow‐up. Clinical report form was filled out for 109 patients; PS data were missing for ten patients, leaving 99 for analysis. Patient characteristics are shown in Table 1. PS at start and six weeks after end of radiotherapy are shown in Figure 1. No patients were in PS3 or 4 after radiotherapy. Conclusion: The majority of patients (85%) with LA‐NSCLC, who were staged with EBUS and PET/CT and received state‐of‐the art concomitant chemoradiotherapy in a randomized dose escalation trial, remained in PS 0‐1 after finished radiotherapy and were thus candidates for adjuvant immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.

abstract = {Background: Up to 50% of patients (pts) with non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) develop central nervous system (CNS) metastases (mets), which are a major source of mortality in NSCLC. Lazertinib (laz), a CNS‐active 3rd‐generation (gen) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) targeting mutant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), improved progression‐free survival (PFS) vs the 1st‐gen TKI gefitinib (gef) in the LASER301 study. Here, we compared laz vs gef among LASER301 pts with CNS mets. Methods: In the phase 3 LASER301 study (NCT04248829), treatment (tx)‐naïve pts with EGFR‐mutated advanced or metastatic NSCLC were randomized 1:1 to laz (240 mg/day) or gef (250 mg/day). Pts with symptomatic/unstable CNS mets were excluded. If tx was required for pts with asymptomatic/stable CNS mets, radiation and/or surgery, and steroids were completed >2 weeks before randomization. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed at screening, every 6 weeks for 18 months (mo), then every 12 weeks relative to randomization, using the same modality at each follow‐up. Endpoints assessed by blinded independent central review and RECIST v1.1 included intracranial PFS (iPFS), intracranial objective response rate (iORR), intracranial duration of response (iDoR), and depth of intracranial response. Results: Of 393 pts in LASER301, 45 (23%) receiving laz and 41 (21%) receiving gef had measurable and/or non‐measurable baseline (BL) CNS mets. BL characteristics were balanced between groups, with most pts having 1–3 CNS lesions (laz: 91%, gef: 83%). Median BL target lesion size was 20.0 mm (laz) and 16.0 mm (gef). Median iPFS in the laz group was 28.2 mo (95% confidence interval [CI]: 14.8, 28.2) vs 8.4 mo (6.7, not reached [NR]) in the gef group (hazard ratio: 0.42; 95% CI: 0.20, 0.89; P=0.02). iORR was higher for the laz (n=17, 94%) vs gef (n=11, 73%) group. At data cutoff, median iDoR in the laz group was NR (8.3, NR) vs 6.3 mo (2.8, NR) in the gef group. The median best change from BL in CNS target lesion size was ‐57% and ‐47% for laz (n=17) and gef (n=14), respectively. No new safety signals were identified from LASER301. Conclusions: In pts with BL CNS mets, laz significantly improved iPFS vs gef with more durable responses. Laz has the potential to improve CNS outcomes in NSCLC.

abstract = {The purpose of this clinical phase I/IIa, open label, single arm, interventional study (EudraCT No 2013‐ 005582‐39) is to investigate the safety, clinical and immunological responses of a therapeutic telomerase peptide vaccine, UV1, combined with ipilimumab in patients with metastatic melanoma (MM). The CTLA‐4 antibody ipilimumab produces long term survival benefits in ca.20% of patients with MM. The mechanism of action of ipilimumab suggests that combinations with therapies inducing tumor‐specific immune responses, such as vaccines, may lead to additive and even synergistic anti‐tumor activity. We hypothesized that a telomerase peptide‐based vaccine in combination with ipilimumab would improve therapeutic efficacy in patients with MM. Telomerase promotes elongation of telomeres after each cell division, representing the key enzymatic process in preventing telomere shortening. It is responsible for human cell immortalization and cancer pathogenesis, and is present in 85‐90% of cancer tissues. Thus, telomerase‐based immunotherapy has been investigated in several tumor types. Available blood samples from long term cancer survivors previously treated with different types of human telomerase reverse transcriptase subunit (hTERT) vaccines identified a new set of peptide epitopes. T cell responses to these peptides form spontaneously after vaccination by epitope spreading and are found only in patients with remarkable clinical courses, suggesting a role in tumor eradication. This led to the development of UV1, a therapeutic cancer vaccine consisting of a mixture of 3 synthetic peptides representing naturally occurring fragments of human hTERT. Ongoing phase I/IIa trials with UV1 in non‐small‐cell lung cancer and prostate cancer (EudraCT No 2012‐001852‐20 and 2012‐002411‐26, respectively) have shown potent, durable T cell responses against UV1 peptides and low toxicity (unpublished data). In the present protocol, patients with a histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of unresectable AJCC stage III/IV MM, ECOG 0‐1 and an adequate renal, hepatic and hematological function are eligible. Any previous treatment is allowed. Patients with active brain metastases, a history of autoimmune disease, splenic surgery or irradiation, allogenic stem cell transplantation, known hypersensitivity to the investigational products, uncontrolled infectious disease, pregnant or breastfeeding, will be excluded. Intradermal UV1 vaccines of 300 mcg and 75 mcg GM‐CSF are administered 7, 5, and 3 days before and 11 days after the first dose of ipilimumab, then 3 days before every dose of ipilimumab, and subsequently every 4th week until week 48 or treatment cessation. Ipilimumab 3 mg/kg is given IV every 3rd week for a total of 4 doses. Each patient will be followed up 5 weeks after the completion of the last study treatment. Adverse events are recorded in coherence with CTCAE vs. 4.0. Tumor response is evaluated according to RECIST vs.1.1. Immune responses against UV1 peptides are monitored by standard immunoassays. Potential predictive biomarkers will be explored in an extensive program involving sequential tumor biopsies, DNA sequencing and mRNA expression. The first patient was enrolled 16 January 2015, estimated completed recruitment by one year. 3 out of 20 patients have been recruited so far. Data from the first 3 patients until week 16 will be reported.},

abstract = {A working definition of Oligometastatic Disease (OMD) in Non‐Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) is no more than 5 metastases involving 3 organs 1. This definition of OMD is largely for the purposes of offering local ablative therapy (LAT) ‐ which includes surgery, or more frequently radiotherapy and, in particular Stereotactic Ablative Body Radiotherapy (SABR). However, OMD is a heterogenous state – which encompasses many clinical scenarios: at diagnosis of NSCLC with synchronous metastases; at recurrence after effective therapy; at progression after systemic therapy; and persistent site (s) of disease on therapy. Cures in the setting of lung surgery and resection of a solitary brain and sometimes adrenal metastasis are well recognised, including in a synchronous setting although the longer the time to recurrence the greater the cure rate. However, the intent of aggressive management of OMD is to delay progression or NSCLC death. There may be other benefits including delaying onset of symptoms, and LAT of large metastases may delay the emergence of resistance clones. Generally, the data for combining systemic therapy and LAT in NSCLC come from the pre‐immunotherapy era. The SABR‐COMET trial recruited 99 solid tumour patients (18 NSCLC), with 1‐5 metastases, and randomised them to standard care or standard care plus SABR to all metastases. At median follow‐up of 51 months (mths), progression free survival (PFS) was increased, and most importantly overall survival (OS) was increased with estimated 42.3% of SABR‐treated patients alive at 5 years versus 17.7% (p=0.006) receiving standard care alone 2. Iyegar et al have reported on their trial of NSCLC patients stable for 3 mths and continuing on systemic maintenance therapy (mostly chemotherapy) with up to 6 tumour sites, randomised to receive SABR or no SABR. The trial recruited 29 patients and accrual was ceased early due to a positive result. PFS favoured the SABR plus systemic therapy arm at median 9.7 mths versus 3.5 mths with chemotherapy alone (HR 0.304; 95% CI 0.113‐0.815) 3. A similarly designed study including 49 NSCLC patients on maintenance chemotherapy (or EGFR or ALK tki, as appropriate) with up to 3 metastases, again closed to accrual early due to a positive result. Patients could receive LAT with surgery or radiotherapy. PFS for LAT‐treated patients was 14.2 mths vs 4.4 mths (p=0.02) and OS 41.2 mths vs 17 mths (p=0.017) 4. The recent SINDAS trial recruited 133 patients receiving first line first generation EGFR tki with up to 5 metastatic sites. Patients were randomised to SABR or no SABR. PFS favoured the SABR‐treated arm (HR 0.62, p< 0.001) as did OS 25.5 mths vs 17.4 mths, HR 0.69, p<0.001. It remains to be determined if similar results will be achieved for patients receiving Osimertinib or the new generations of EGFR therapies. Similarly, the role of LAT in metastatic ALK‐translocated NSCLC with newer‐generation tkis is unclear. Almost all stage III – IV NSCLC patients now receive immunotherapy as first line treatment, mostly combined with chemotherapy. As oncologists gained experience with checkpoint inhibitors, radiotherapy, often given as SABR, has become standard practice to control metastases which escape immune control. However, for patients with high tumour PD‐L1 score and treated with checkpoint inhibitors, it remains to be determined whether the already substantial proportion surviving 5 years can be augmented by LAT. There has recently been a focus on the role of radiotherapy in enhancing tumour control with checkpoint inhibitors via the abscopal effect – which is a recognised but infrequent out of field response in metastases distant from the radiotherapy‐treated tumour. In the PEMBR‐RT phase II trial 76 patients were randomised to receive ongoing pembrolizumab or pembrolizumab preceded by SBRT to a single tumour deposit. Outcomes favoured the SABR‐treated patients with response rate at 12 weeks 36% vs 18% (p=0.07), median PFS 6.6 mths vs 1.9 mths, and OS 15.9 mths vs 7.6 mths. The primary endpoint was not met but there were clear trends 6. In a similar phase II trial patients randomised to radiotherapy could be treated with SABR or conventional radiotherapy, and in addition patients randomised to pembrolizumab alone could receive radiotherapy after the second 3‐weekly pembrolizumab dose if the was progression 7. A combined analysis of these two trials indicated improved PFS, out of field (abscopal) response and OS in the experimental arm 8. The benefit of adding SABR to pembrolizumab were predominantly seen with tumours PD‐L1 < 1%. Important questions remain: these two trials were conducted with pembrolizumab alone whereas most patients now receive chemo‐immunotherapy, and this is certainly the case with PD‐L1 low tumours. In addition, the ideal dose and fractionation of radiotherapy to elicit an abscopal effect in the context of immunotherapy is unclear. Nevertheless, these encouraging results warrant a phase III study. 1 Dingemans A‐M, et al. Definition of synchronous oligometastatic non‐small cell lung cancer.

Our previous sturdy indicated that patients who received immunotherapy and subsequent radiotherapy suffered higher proportion of pneumonitis. Patients suffered grade 2 or more pneumonitis have worse prognosis. It is urged to optimize the radiotherapy dose and target volume for patients treated with immunotherapy and radiotherapy. According to retrospective and prospective studies, omitting primary tumor CTV radiation therapy showed no reduction in local control and survival for locally advanced NSCLC. It is postulated that omitting CTV radiation for patients responded to therapy with immunotherapy and chemotherapy will have less pneumonitis without sacrificing the local control rate. Omitting CTV may also retain better immune function which will facilitate the immunotherapy.},

abstract = {Purpose/Objective(s): The aim of this phase II study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of concurrent chemoproton therapy (CCPT) using adaptive planning for stage III locally advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Materials/Methods: Eligibility criteria were as follows: (1) histologically or cytologically‐confirmed unresectable stage III NSCLC; (2) chemo‐naïve status; (3) ECOG‐PS ≤ 1; (4) age ≥ 20 and < 75 years; (5) no previous radiotherapy around the lesion; (6) no previous chemotherapy; (7) dose constraints of the organs at risk achievable; (8) lesions evaluable with RECIST; and (9) written informed consent. Primary endpoint was the 2‐year overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoint was the local control rate (LCR), progression‐free survival (PFS), incidence of adverse events, and change of quality of life (QOL). Toxicities were evaluated with CTCAE ver. 4.0. QOL score were evaluated with EORTC QLQ‐C30 ver. 3.0 and QLQ‐LC13. We hypothesized that the 2‐year OS would be increased from a baseline of 40% to 60% and calculated that 41 patients would need to be enrolled to have a 80% chance of demonstrating improvement using a 1‐sided Chi‐square test with a significance level of.05 and 5% of drop‐out patients. Survival was analyzed by using the Kaplan‐Meier method. Patients received cisplatin (80 mg/m2) on day 1 and S‐1 (30‐40 mg/m2 twice daily) on days 1 to 14, q4w, up to 4 cycles, plus concurrent PT at a total dose of 70 GyE for primary lesion and 66 GyE for lymph node metastasis with 2 GyE per day. PT was performed using respiratory‐gated and image‐guided techniques, and adaptive plans were implemented. Results: From August 2013 to December 2017, 41 patients were enrolled. The patient characteristics were as follows: median age, 66 (31‐74) years; male/female, 30/11; PS 0, 34 pts; stage IIIA/IIIB, 22/19; non‐squamous histology, 24 (59%). Twenty‐three pts were out of indication for radical chemo‐radiation with X rays. All 4 cycles of S‐1 plus CDDP could be completed in 30 pts and the mean number of cycles was 3.5 (range: 1‐4). The median follow‐up period of surviving patients was 32 months (range: 14‐64). The mean number of replanning was 2.5 (range: 0‐4). Grade 3/4 toxicities were: neutropenia 32%, anemia 9.8%, thrombocytopenia 7.3%, fatigue 2.4%, esophagitis 2.4%, enteritis 9.8%, and radiation pneumonitis 0%. One case of febrile neutropenia was observed. The 2‐year OS, LCR and PFS were 74% (95% confidence interval: 60‐88%), 83% (70‐96%), and 43% (26‐59%), respectively. The median OS was not reached. There were no significant differences in the QOL score before treatment and after 24 months except for dyspnea. Conversely, emotional and social functioning significantly improved. Conclusion: CCPT with adaptive planning is considered to be effective and well tolerated for locally advanced NSCLC. Further evaluations in a large randomized controlled trial with immunotherapy are warranted.},

abstract = {Purpose/Objective(s): While hypofractionated radiotherapy (HypoRT) has widely replaced standard fractionated RT in early‐stage non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), major side effects have limited its use in advanced NSCLC. Based on improved dosimetry of proton therapy (PT), we investigated the HypoPT approach for stage II‐III NSCLC. Materials/Methods: Between March 2013 and November 2018, 28 patients from 4 centers were enrolled on an IRB‐approved clinical trial of HypoPT with concurrent chemotherapy followed by adjuvant chemotherapy or immunotherapy (after January 2018). Patients could be simultaneously enrolled in a phase 1 study and receive doses of 2.5 (n=14), 3 (n=6), 3.53(n=7), and 4 Gy/fraction (n=1) to a total dose of 60 GyRBE according to the open arm and organ‐at‐risk (OAR) dosimetric constraints. Weekly carboplatin and paclitaxel was the most common concurrent chemotherapy regimen (89%). The median patient age was 70 years (range, 50‐86); most patients were male (71%) and white (82%). Pathology included 50% adenocarcinoma, 46% squamous cell carcinoma, and 4% mixed. Patients had stage IIA (n=3), IIB (n=3), IIIA (n=15), and IIIB (n=7) NSCLC. N‐stage distribution included 5 patients with N0, 6 with N1, 15 with N2, and 2 with N3 disease. CTCAE, v4.0, was used for toxicity assessment. The primary endpoint of the study was 1‐year overall survival (OS). The study closed prematurely due to slow accrual and the need to increase the sample size based on the PACIFIC trial results. Results: The median follow‐up for surviving patients was 23 months (range, 1‐60). The 1‐ and 2‐year OS rates were 89% and 66%, and the 1‐ and 2‐year progression‐free survival rates were 70% and 60%, respectively. Three patients died within 3 months of HypoPT completion: 1 from a bronchial hemorrhage; 1 from congestive heart failure following infectious pneumonia and C. Diff colitis; and 1 from paraneoplastic SIADH after completing just 42 Gy at 3.53 Gy/fraction. Additionally, 6 patients died more than 1 year after HypoPT: 5 from disease progression and 1 from a cardiac event. Conclusion: In this phase II study, HypoPT at 2.5 to 3.53 Gy per fraction to 60 Gy (RBE) with concurrent chemotherapy was well tolerated with favorable PFS and OS. A large randomized clinical trial comparing HypoPT with standard fractionated RT or PT is warranted, especially in the setting of consolidation immunotherapy.},

abstract = {Programmed cell death 1 (PD‐1) checkpoint pathway inhibitors have greatly changed the treatment paradigm for advanced stage non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Durvalumab is approved for use as a single agent after chemotherapy combined with radiation for stage 3 NSCLC.(1) Pembrolizumab is approved for use in the first line treatment setting for advanced NSCLC not amenable to radiation for patients whose tumor has a tumor proportion score (TPS) of 1% or greater in the United States.(2) For patients whose tumor has a TPS of ≥ 50%, it is approved for use in the first‐line treatment setting in multiple countries throughout the world.(3) However, PD‐1 checkpoint blockade combinations, either anti‐PD1 or anti‐PD‐L1 antibodies, with chemotherapy regardless of PD‐L1 status have shown benefit as well. (4,5,6) Single agent immunotherapy (IO) has several advantages. Cost of combination therapy is an issue. While these PD‐1 pathway blocking antibodies are expensive as single agents, combining them with chemotherapy adds to the cost, time in infusion, and adds chemotherapy related side effects. So, if patients can, single agent immunotherapy is still preferred, particularly in a population i.e. TPS ≥ 50% who is more likely to benefit compared to chemotherapy. Some would say the same is true for patients with TPS ≥ 1, but here the data for single agent IO compared to combinations with chemotherapy is mixed. While trials comparing this scenario, i.e. comparing single agent PD‐1 antibody compared to chemotherapy plus IO, head to head have not yet been done, it is hard not to do cross trial comparisons as seen in table 1. Clearly though, chemotherapy and IO combinations have increased objective response rates regardless of PD‐L1 TPS status where response rates range from 57.9%‐62.1%.(4,5,6,7,10) While combinations with chemotherapy show increased response rate regardless of PD‐L1 TPS, chemotherapy can have deleterious effects on the immune system. (8) Chemotherapy can alter immune function by causing lymphopenia. Steroids, added to chemotherapy regimens to prevent allergic reactions and control nausea, can suppress pro‐inflammatory cytokines and impair Natural Killer (NK) cell function and dendritic cell differentiation or activation. Taxanes specifically can cause inhibition of T‐cell and NK‐cell activation. Thus, these combinations may prevent immune activation and suppress immune memory. Duration of response in single agent IO in the first line treatment setting is 16.8‐20.2+ month.(9,2,3) The duration of response in the IO plus chemotherapy patient population is 7.7‐11.2 months.(4,5,6) The data from the chemotherapy IO combinations is too immature to know what the potential five‐year survival is compared to the impressive 23.2% 5 year survival rate of the initial trial of pembrolizumab in the treatment‐naïve setting(Keynote 001).(9) Immunotherapy, particularly PD‐1 pathway checkpoint antibodies, have drastically changed the treatment landscape for advanced stage lung cancer patients. Single agent pembrolizumab particularly in patients with TPS ≥ 50% lung cancer results in an impressive long term survival that is not seen with chemotherapy alone. Combining immunotherapy agents with chemotherapy increases disease response but long term survival outcome data and duration of response is immature.

abstract = {Introduction: Tislelizumab ‐ a humanized, monoclonal antibody for programmed cell death protein 1 ‐ has demonstrated significantly improved progression‐free survival (PFS) and reduced risk of progression versus standard of care in advanced lung cancer (NCT03432598, NCT03594747). We conducted a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, open‐label study to assess the safety and efficacy of tislelizumab plus chemotherapy in patients with advanced squamous non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (NCT03594747). Here, we report results from patients with stage IIIB disease. Methods: Adults in China with treatment‐naïve histologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic (stage IIIB or IV) squamous NSCLC not amenable to surgery or not suitable for chemoradiation were randomized 1:1:1 to Arm A: tislelizumab (200 mg) plus paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 and carboplatin AUC 5 (every 3 weeks [Q3W] on day 1); Arm B: tislelizumab plus nab‐paclitaxel 100 mg/m2 (Q3W on days 1, 8 and 15) plus carboplatin (Q3W on day 1); or Arm C: paclitaxel plus carboplatin (Q3W on day 1). Paclitaxel, nab‐paclitaxel and carboplatin were administered for 4–6 cycles. All treatments were administered intravenously. Stratification factors were disease stage (IIIB vs IV), and programmed death‐ligand 1 expression (<1% vs 1–49% vs ≥50% tumor cells). Tislelizumab was administered until loss of benefit, withdrawal or start of new anticancer therapy. In this subgroup analysis, PFS, objective response rate (ORR) (assessed by independent review committee) and safety were evaluated in patients with stage IIIB disease. Results: Overall, 122/360 (33.9%) patients had stage IIIB NSCLC. Patients were randomized to Arm A (38 patients), B (40 patients) or C (44 patients). The median age was 61 years (range 34–74 years). At median follow‐up time of 8.6 months across all arms, PFS was numerically longer, and ORR higher, respectively, with tislelizumab (Arms A and B) versus chemotherapy alone (Arm C) (Table, PFS: HR=0.402 [Arm A] vs 0.372 [Arm B]). The PFS benefit observed was consistent with the ITT population (Table). TEAEs (≥1) and Grade ≥3 TEAEs were similar across all arms (Table). No new safety signals were observed. Laboratory abnormalities were the most commonly reported TEAEs across all arms. Conclusion: In this subgroup analysis, a clinically meaningful improvement in PFS and higher ORR was observed with tislelizumab plus chemotherapy versus standard of care in patients with stage IIIB advanced squamous NSCLC. The safety and efficacy profile of tislelizumab was consistent with the overall population. [Formula presented] Keywords: PD‐1, NSCLC, immunotherapy},

abstract = {Background Checkpoint inhibitors of programmed cell death‐1 protein (PD‐1)/programmed cell death‐ligand 1 (PD‐L1) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated protein 4 (CTLA‐4) pathways have demonstrated clinically meaningful improvement in survival for patients with various tumor types. Preclinical data demonstrate significant interplay between innate and adaptive immune systems. Targeting colony‐stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF‐1R) may lead to disruption of the immunosuppressive effects of innate immune cells expressing CSF‐1R. Treatment with an anti‐CSF‐1R monoclonal antibody (mAb) induces anti‐tumor responses in multiple murine tumor models when combined with CTLA‐4 blockade [1], suggesting that combining a checkpoint inhibitor with a CSF‐1 pathway inhibitor may potentiate the anti‐tumor response. Study I5F‐MC‐JSCC will evaluate the effects of CSF‐1R inhibition using LY3022855 (anti‐CSF‐1R mAb) in combination with durvalumab (MEDI4736; anti‐PD‐L1 mAb) or tremelimumab (anti‐CTLA‐4 mAb) in participants with advanced solid malignancies. Methods JSCC is a phase Ia/Ib open‐label, 3+3 dose‐escalation (Part A), followed by dose‐expansion (Part B) study of LY3022855 in combination with either durvalumab or tremelimumab. Eligible patients have confirmed solid malignancies (regardless of PD‐L1 status) and ECOG PS 0‐1. Patients must not have received small molecule therapy, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, monoclonal antibody treatment, or immunosuppressive medication within 14‐28 days of start of study treatment, but prior immune checkpoint therapy is permitted. Pretreatment and on‐treatment biopsies will be obtained (Part A all patients, Part B ovarian cohort). In the LY3022855+durvalumab regimen, LY3022855 (IV) will be administered at increasing dose levels as tolerated; durvalumab (IV) will be administered at a fixed dose. In the LY3022855 +tremelimumab regimen, both LY3022855 and tremelimumab (IV) will be administered at increasing dose levels as tolerated. Once a maximum tolerated dose has been identified for each combination, enrollment to Part B (5 disease‐specific expansion cohorts of 20 patients per cohort: LY3022855+durvalumab‐non‐small cell lung cancer, ovarian, melanoma; LY3022855+tremelimumab‐mesothelioma, melanoma) will begin. The primary objective is to characterize the safety and tolerability of each combination in treatment of patients with advanced solid malignancies, as well as define a recommended phase II dose. Secondary objectives include assessment of antitumor activity of each combination, immunogenicity, and pharmacokinetics. Exploratory objectives are to assess immunomodulatory effects of the combinations. Approximately 178 patients are planned.},

abstract = {Background: Elucidation of cancer immunoediting from immune surveillance to immune escape and approval of immune check point inhibitors by FDA prompted immunotherapy became a forth modality next to surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. We have recruited advanced lung cancer patients with poor prognosis who had undergone surgery to improve prognosis by immunotherapy. Objective and methods: Post‐surgical lung cancer patients were randomly designated to receive either chemoimmunotherapy (4 courses of chemotherapy with 10‐14 courses of cellular immunotherapy: group A) or chemotherapy (4 courses of chemotherapy: group B). Immunotherapy comprised adoptive intravenous transfer of autologous activated killer T cells and dendritic cells (AKT‐DC) obtained from the regional lymph nodes of lung cancer patients. The study inclusion criteria were: <76 years; PS 0 or 1; non‐small cell lung cancer; pathological stage, IB‐IV. Patients whose surgery was palliative or in whom macroscopic residual tumors remained after surgery were excluded but those with microscopic residual tumors detected after a cytopathological examination were included in the study. Patients with pleural dissemination were excluded but those with malignant pleural effusion were included and received intra‐thoracic chemotherapy with 20mg CDDP 4 times (group B) or chemotherapy with 4 to 8 courses of AKT‐DC immunotherapy (group A) through a subcutaneous port with intrathoracic catheter installed in the thoracic cavity after resection of the primary tumors. A patient who had a recurrence of malignant ascites in group A received peritoneal infusion of AKT‐DC after cell‐free concentrated ascites reinfusion therapy (CART). Result: A hundred‐and three patients were selected for randomization. The 2‐, 5‐, and 7‐year overall survival rates were 96.0% 69.4%, and 55.1 in group A (n=51) and 64.7%, 45.1%, and 38.1% in group B (n=52), respectively. The Hazard ratio was 0.439 in favor of group A by multivariate analysis. There were 11 group A and 9 group B patients with malignant pleural effusion. One patient in group A and 6 patients in group B had recurrence and 3 died within 2 years in group B. The difference was also significant in favor of group A. A patient with malignant ascites received 5 times AKT‐DC therapy with 7 courses of CART in 2 months. Complete elimination of tumor cells accompanied with ascites eradication resulted in 9 months prolongation of survival after recurrence. Conclusion: Patients with lung cancer benefited from adoptive cellular immunotherapy as an adjuvant to surgery. Intrathoracic and peritoneal cellular immunotherapy with AKT‐DC are effective to patients with malignant effusions.

abstract = {Background: Nivolumab combined with Ipilimumab (Ipi/Nivo) has been shown to improve overall survival compared to chemotherapy in first‐line treatment of stage IV non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Brain metastasis patients have often been excluded from many clinical trials. We examined outcomes of brain metastasis patients included on a phase 1 trial of combined immune checkpoint blockade and multi‐site stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in newly diagnosed stage IV NSCLC. Methods: All patients underwent brain MRI as part of trial screening. Treatment naïve patients with advanced NSCLC were eligible for enrollment. Patients received SBRT to 1 to 4 extracranial metastases and were randomized to receive 1st cycle of Ipi/Nivo either during or after multi‐site SBRT. Ipi/Nivo continued until progression, development of toxicity, or up to two years. Brain metastases > 3 mm in size were treated with radiosurgery or WBRT prior to starting systemic therapy and multi‐site SBRT. Results: 35 patients were treated with multi‐site SBRT and received at least one cycle of Ipi/Nivo. 9 patients had brain metastasis at diagnosis. 8 patients received SRS while one received WBRT. With a median follow‐up time of 15 months for all patients, median OS for the brain metastasis cohort has not been reached. All 9 brain metastasis patients remain alive; 7 of these patients have remained alive for at least 15 months and continue on Ipi/Nivo. Two of 18 treated lesions (11%) developed radiation necrosis. Of 26 patients enrolled without brain metastases, 5 developed intracranial disease. Four of these 5 patients underwent salvage WBRT and remain alive, free of intracranial progression. The 1‐year intracranial progression‐free survival (PFS) was 81.7% and was 87.0% in those enrolled without brain metastasis. In the 9 patients with brain metastasis, only 3 went on to progress intracranially, notably within a short time frame (within 3 months). Median PFS did not differ between BM (13.1 months) and non‐BM(5.86 months) cohorts (p=NS). Two patients in the brain metastasis cohort had lesions at diagnosis that were not treated with SRS which had complete response with immunotherapy alone. Conclusions: Ipi/nivo/SBRT is a successful treatment strategy in patients with NSCLC brain metastasis. Outcomes do not appear to be inferior for these patients compared to non‐brain metastasis stage IV patients and they should be included in trials in the immunotherapy era. Intracranial control appears promising. Further intracranial efficacy of Ipi/Nivo and outcomes of brain metastasis patients will be explored in a phase II expansion.},

abstract = {Background. Immunotherapy has revolutionized the treatment of advanced lung cancer. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether adding stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) to immunotherapy (IT) further improves responses and survival outcomes. Therefore, in this pooled analysis, we comprehensively compared IT plus SBRT with IT alone in patients with advanced lung cancer. Methods. Online databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane CENTRAL, were systematically searched on April 24, 2022. Eligible studies were randomized clinical trials comparing IT plus SBRT to IT. The primary outcomes were the objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR). Progression‐free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were explored as secondary outcomes. Results. Overall, three phase 2 randomized clinical trials with a total of 146 previously treated lung cancer patients were enrolled. The median PFS and OS were 3.8 months and 9.5 months for IT plus SBRT versus 2.4 months and 6.1 months for IT. Comparing IT plus SBRT with IT alone, pooled risk ratios for ORR and DCR were 1.95 (95% confidence interval 1.07‐3.53, p = 0.03) and 1.28 (0.94‐1.73, p = 0.12). While pooled hazard ratios were 0.77 (0.25‐2.42, p = 0.66) for PFS and 0.71 (0.16‐3.21, p = 0.65) for OS, respectively. No publication bias was found across the trials. Conclusion. Compared to IT alone, the addition of SBRT improved the best response but failed to prolong the survival outcomes in treating advanced lung cancer patients. Future studies are necessary to explore new modalities of the combination of IT and SBRT.},

abstract = {The demonstration that therapies directed at the programmed death‐1 (PD‐1) receptor or its ligand (PD‐L1) result in durable responses and improved survival in a number of solid tumors including non‐small cell lung cancer has awakened interest in cancer immunotherapy. The activity of PD‐1/PD‐L1 therapy in NSCLC implies that endogenous T‐cells can recognize antigens on tumor cells and eliminate those cancer cells. The success of checkpoint inhibitor therapy in the metastatic setting has led to a immunotherapy trials in early stage (adjuvant) and stage lll NSCLC. This session will provide perspective on the current state and challenges facing immunotherapy in these settings. Current perspectives: The concept of using immunotherapy to prevent recurrence of NSCLC after resection of early stage NSCLC is not new. More recently, two randomized phase lll trials of therapeutic cancer vaccine strategies have been completed in resected, early stage NSCLC (MAGRIT) or after chemoradiation in stage lll disease (START). The MAGRIT trial1 assessed the efficacy of an active, specific cancer immunotherapy (ASCI) against the MAGE‐A3 cancer testis antigen in completely resected stage IB‐IIIA NSCLC. Tumors from more than 13,000 patients were screened for MAGE‐A3 expression and 2312 patients whose tumors expressed MAGE A3 were randomized 2:1 to MAGE‐A3 (ASCI) or placebo. The MAGRIT trial failed to meet its primary end‐point of improvement in disease free survival with MAGE‐A3 ASCI. The START trial2 assessed a MUC1 vaccine in stage III NSCLC patients who had response or stable disease after standard chemoradiation. The chemoradiation could have been delivered concurrently or sequentially. The modified intention to treat population included 1239 patients. The primary end‐point was not met (adj. HRO .88, 95% CI 0.75 ‐103, p=0.123). Further development of this agent has been abandoned. The failure of these two large global phase III studies raises doubt about vaccine strategies used in isolation in early stage NSCLC. There are a number of possible explanations for these negative results.3 One of the primary reasons is that cancer vaccines, when used alone, fail to address the many immunosuppressive factors operating in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Clinical trials evaluating anti PD‐1/PD‐L1 therapy in early stage or locally advanced NSCLC have not yet reported results. The PACIFIC trial (NCT 20125461) is a randomized phase III trial of MEDI4736 versus placebo following concurrent chemoradiation in patients with stage III NSCLC. The primary outcome measures are OS and PFS. This trial completed accrual in April 2016 and has randomized more than 700 patients. In addition to the important efficacy outcomes, a number of exploratory objectives will assess tissue and blood for potential biomarkers. The Canadian Cancer Clinical Trials Group is assessing MEDI 4736 versus placebo in completely resected stage IB‐IIIA NSCLC (NCT 02273375). This trial will randomize 1100 patients with the primary outcome measure being DFS in PD‐L1 positive patients. PD‐L1 positive is defined as > % positive tumor cells. Immune based prognostic markers: The TME consists of stromal cells including endothelial cells and fibroblasts and a number of immune cell types. Tumors may escape immune recognition in large part by modulating the recruitment and function of various immune cells into the TME.4 A comprehensive review of the prognostic value of different immune cells in NSCLC has been reported.5 Two recent studies have separately assessed tumor lymphocytic infiltration (TLI)6 or stromal CD8+ T‐cell density7 as potential prognostic markers in early stage NSCLC. Using the large, relatively homogenous population of curative resected NSCLC patients from the LACE‐Bio collaboration, Brambilla et al examine the prognostic and predictive value of TLI. Patients were separated into discovery and validation sets. An intense TLI (>50% stromal lymphocytes in tumor bulk) was strongly prognostic of favorable overall survival and disease free survival. Based on previous work, Donner et al selected stromal CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocyte as the most promising immunobased prognostic marker. Using four separate cohorts of curatively resected stage I‐III patients, they established training and validation sets. Tissue microarrays were scored for stromal CD8 TLI's; stromal CD8 TIL density was found to be an independent prognostic factor and retained significant prognostic impact within each stage. The value of PD‐L1 as a biomarker in NSCLC has been investigated primarily in advanced disease and focused on prediction of response and/or survival. Studies investigating the value of PD‐L1 as a prognostic marker in early stage NSCLC have many limitations. These studies are small, include heterogenous populations, assess PD‐L1 using different antibodies and scoring systems and included PDL1 on tumor cells only or tumor cells and TLI's. It is not surprising that these studies show conflicting results. Based on the available evidence, the prognostic value of PD‐L1 expression in early stage NSCLC remains uncertain. The adjuvant trials of anti‐PD1/PD‐L1 therapy currently being conductedmay clarify the value of PD‐L1 as both prognostic and predictive biomarkers in this setting. Challenges One of the fundamental challenges to developing effective cancer immunotherapies is our limited understanding of the human immune system in steady state and its response to stress. Animal models do not necessarily translate to humans. The Human Vaccines Project8 is a global initiative that has as one of its primary objectives the decoding of the human immune system and providing a map of the human “immunome”. This private‐public partnership uses state‐of‐the‐art machine learning and technologies to elucidate the principles of immunogenicity to accelerate the development of new immunotherapies against infectious diseases and cancer. A second challenge is howbest to target micrometastases in the adjuvant and locally advanced setting. While the primary tumor and metastatic lesions have many mutations in common, metastatic tumors possess mutations that are distinct from the primary. Do adjuvant therapies need to target the metastatic cascade and if so, which steps are the most susceptible to intervention? 9 The complex of the TME would predict that focusing on TIL's or PD‐L1 is likely to result in only modest improvements in outcome. Blank et al10 argue that it will take a combination of biomarkers, the “cancer immunogram,” to determine the best approach in individual patients.},

abstract = {Immunotherapeutic approaches have demonstrated clinical efficacy in several advanced cancer types like melanoma, non‐small cell lung cancer and renal cell carcinoma. In oesophago‐gastric tumours we can found PD‐L1 upregulation in about 40%, but the PD‐L1 is expressed, in contrast to other tumour types, mainly on infiltrating lymphocytes and less on tumour cells. Other potential biomarkers could be the extent of infiltrating lymphocytes or the mutational load, which is often very high in the oesophago‐gastric adenocacrcinoma. A lot of phase ‐l/ll trials have been performed with single agent checkpoint inhibitors in gastric and oesophago‐gastric tumours and showed response rates of 22‐27% for patients with PD‐L1+ tumours and 10‐17% for unselected patients. In addition, in patients with squamous oesophageal cancer durable anti‐tumor activity was observed with 15‐20% overall response rate. Most of the ongoing studies in the advanced setting are now investigating combinations of checkpoint inhibitors with targeted therapies or chemotherapies. The adjuvant approach to improve patient outcomes has failed using chemotherapy and radiotherapy due to the high postoperative morbidity. Here immunotherapy could be an alternative. Additionally, to block the PD‐1 pathway earlier in a disease course may be the better way to have an immune‐mediated cancer regression. The most important study in this setting is the CheckMate‐577 study, a randomized phase III study of adjuvant nivolumab/placebo for patients with resected oesophageal cancer and still residual tumor in the specimen. For the inclusion in this trial a poor prognosis group of patients is clinically selected by the response to the neoadjuvant chemoradiation. This group of patients has a 5y‐survival of only 30‐40% without further therapy. This important and large trial in the adjuvant setting is ongoing; other smaller trials are investigating checkpoint inhibitors in the neoadjuvant setting together with radiation therapy. However, we already know that the biology of adenocarcinoma of distal oesophagus, gastro‐oesophageal junction carcinoma and adenocarcinoma of cardia is distinctive; therefore we may In the future select patients for immunotherapy according to mutational changes and immune microenvironment.},

abstract = {Background: Immunotherapy improves outcomes in the advanced (Bellmunt 2019; Powles 2020) as well as in the adjuvant setting post cystectomy (Bajorin 2021) for muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) patients. Trimodality treatment (TMT) consisting of transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) followed by chemoradiotherapy (CRT) may be considered an alternative to radical cystectomy in MIBC. The role of radiotherapy and chemotherapy as immune system stimulants provides a rationale to evaluate the anticancer activity of checkpoint inhibitors in this patient population. Durvalumab, an anti PDL1 inhibitor, administered after CRT leads to improvement in PFS and OS in patients with locally advanced NSCLC, which further supports the rationale for this study (Antonia 2017, 2018). We hypothesized that durvalumab will improve outcomes in patients with MIBC when administered in the adjuvant setting after completion of trimodality therapy. Methods: CCTG BL13 is a Canadian Cancer Trials Group, randomized phase II trial in patients with stage T2‐T4a N0M0, urothelial carcinoma treated with TURBT followed by radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy. Treatment arms consist of durvalumab 1500 mg IV q 4 weeks for 12 months versus surveillance. The primary objective: to compare disease free survival (DFS) between arms (RECIST 1.1, investigator assessed). Secondary endpoints include a non muscle‐invasive bladder cancer recurrence rate (< T2); locoregional control rate; overall survival; bladder intact DFS, patterns of disease recurrence; metastasis free survival; safety; quality of life ; economics evaluation. A pilot sub study (BL13F) has been activated and will evaluate the feasibility of electronic real‐time patient self‐reporting of immunotherapy related symptomatic adverse events using the SYMPTOM‐IQ Tool on the uMotif Mobile Health Application (APP). Statistical Design: Randomization 1:1 balanced for stratification factors: ECOG PS; neoadjuvant chemotherapy; radiation field extent; T2 vs T3/T4; centre. Assuming a 2‐year DFS rate 65% for patients on the control arm and estimated 12% improvement in the 2‐year DFS rate (65% to 77% (HR 0.61)) with 80% power using a 1‐sided 10% level test requires a sample size of 190 including 5% drop out rate.

abstract = {The identification of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene rearrangements as an oncogenic driver in NSCLC has radically changed the treatment of a subset of patients harboring this molecular alteration.1 ALK mutations occur in 3‐7% of NSCLCs and are more frequently associated with never/light smoker, younger age and adenocarcinoma histology. Crizotinib, an oral small‐molecule multitargeted ALK/c‐MET /ROS1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors, was the first‐in‐class agent approved from FDA for advanced, ALK‐rearranged NSCLC. The accelerated approval in 2011 was granted on the basis of pronounced activity observed in early phase I and II clinical studies, coupled with a favorable toxicity‐profile and concurrent development of a diagnostic test for ALK rearrangement.2 More recently, the results from a front‐line phase III trial in ALK‐positive NSCLC, PROFILE 1014, revealed the superiority, in terms of progression free survival (PFS) and overall response rate (ORR), of crizotinib versus standard pemetrexed‐platinum chemotherapy.3 Based on these data, crizotinib represents standard fist‐ line therapy in patients with advanced ALK mutant NSCLC.4 Despite marked and durable initial responses to crizotinib, most patients develop progressive disease after a median of 11 months, with the brain as a common site of relapse. This can be explained by pharmacokinetic limitations rather than a biologic resistance. Several acquired resistance mechanisms have been characterized, including secondary mutations in the ALK kinase domain and/or ALK copy number alterations. ALK‐independent resistance mechanisms can also occur through activation of alternative bypass signaling pathways, such as EGFR activation, KIT amplification, KRAS mutation and IGF‐R1 activation.5 This evidence has prompted the development of increasingly potent, selective and brain‐penetrant ALK inhibitors, with differential spectrum of activity against the most common resistance mutations.6 Several next‐generation ALK inhibitors, such as ceritinib, alectinib, brigatinib have demonstrated clinical benefit in patients with crizotinib‐refractory NSCLC patients also at the central nervous system (CNS) level. This observation has supported the assessment of these drugs as frontline therapy in patients crizotinb‐naïve with advanced ALK+ NSCLC.7 Soria and colleagues have published the results of the ASCEND‐4 trial, randomizing ALK+ treatment naïve patients to ceritinib or chemotherapy. Ceritinib treatment significantly has improved median PFS compared to chemotherapy (16.6 vs 8.1 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.55,P<0.00001). This molecule was also associated with a better control of the disease in the brain (PFS10.7 vs 6.7 months, HR 0.70, 95% CI: 0.44–1.12). Dose‐limiting gastrointestinal adverse events were common with ceritinib at the starting dose of 750 mg daily and 80% of cases required dose reduction or interruption. Although ceritinib has not been compared head‐to‐head with crizotinib, data confirm ALK inhibitor superior efficacy compared to standard chemotherapy in the ALK‐rearranged NSCLC and suggest ceritinib as another option for the front line management.8 First Line Head to Head trials are ongoing or recently completed. Findings from J‐ALEX trial, involving untreated Japanese patients with ALK‐rearranged advanced NSCLC, have shown that alectinib induces longer durations of response compared to crizotinib. Median PFS exceeded 2 years in the alectinib group, compared with just over 10 months in the crizotinib group.9 Recently, Peters et al. have presented the results of global ALEX study. Data are consistent with previous Japanese analysis: PFS was significantly improved with alectinib as compared to crizotinib (25,7 5% vs 10,4%, HR 0.5, p<0.0001). In addition, 12% of patients in alectinib arm vs 45% in crizotinib arm has experienced brain progression (cause specific HR 0.16; 95% CI, 0.10 to 0.28; P<0.001). Alectinib appeared to be better tolerated than crizotinib with grade 3 to 5 adverse events occurring in 41% vs 50% of patients, respectively.10 Other studies with next‐generation ALK inhibitors versus crizotinib—such as lorlatinib, brigatinib, are ongoing and they will help define optimal sequencing therapy for patients with ALK‐rearranged NSCLC. To improve outcomes in this patient population, some studies are also currently investigating several combination strategies, including immunotherapy, anti‐angiogenetic agents or radiotherapy approach in association with ALK inhibitors as shown in Table 1. Treatment paradigms continue to evolve for patients with advanced ALK‐positive NSCLC subsequently to rapid development of ALK inhibitors history. It is expected that one of the next generation of ALK inhibitors will be used as first‐line. In this landscape it is necessary to define the impact of first‐line choice on patterns of progression and mechanisms of resistance.11 It is uncertain if a specific sequence of therapeutic agents influences the biology of the cancer and therefore the clinical course of the patient. The spectrum of ALK resistance mutations varies according to ALK inhibitor and it is unclear if the mechanisms of resistance to these agents as the first ALK inhibitor will be similar to the mechanisms of resistance identified when they are used after crizotinib. Future efforts should be focused on determining the best treatment sequence to maximize clinical outcomes. Key factors to guide the selection of therapies could include: molecular characteristics of the patient's tumor, different toxicity profile of different ALK inhibitors, availability of combinations/ multimodal therapy.

abstract = {Routine biomarker testing in metastatic lung cancer has led to enormous improvements in outcomes for our patients with metastatic lung cancers. Oncogene testing has allowed us to identify the 50% of patients with metastatic lung cancer that are eligible for targeted therapies1. Consistently, targeted therapy for EGFR, ALK, ROS1, RET, BRAF have demonstrated superior progression‐free survival compared to standard cytotoxic chemotherapy2. Identification of these genomic biomarkers has provided additional treatment options for our patients that are more effective and less toxic than standard treatments. In addition, serial biomarker testing allows us to also identify mechanisms of resistance to targeted therapy which can then inform subsequent treatment decisions. PDL1 testing is also routinely performed in the metastatic setting and assists us in identifying patients that may benefit from immunotherapy alone instead of first‐line combination immunotherapy and chemotherapy treatment3. PDL1 testing allows us to predict likelihood of response to immunotherapy and selects patients that we can de‐escalate treatment; patients with high PDL1 expression derive benefit from treatment with immunotherapy alone. Routine utilization of biomarker testing in metastatic lung cancer is easily the most importance advancement in this field to date. Current recommendations: Biomarker testing for patients with locally advanced lung cancers is currently not recommended in the NCCN guidelines or any expert guidelines. This is likely because the current management for locally advanced lung cancers do not incorporate the use of biomarkers. Patients currently receive adjuvant durvalumab after concurrent chemoradiation for stage 3 disease irrespective of PDL1 status. Currently, adjuvant targeted therapies after definitive resection or radiation are not recommended in the NCCN or other cancer care guidelines. Oncogene testing: The risk of recurrence for early stage lung cancers remain high. After surgical resection, adjuvant chemotherapy for high risk stage 1B, stage 3 and stage 4 and post‐operative radiation for patients with mediastinal lymph node involvement are both recommended are they improve survival. Despite this, there is a large subset of patients that will have recurrent disease. Because of their demonstrated superiority over chemotherapy in the metastatic setting, there is great interest in assessing whether adjuvant targeted therapies would improve outcomes in the locally advanced disease setting. EGFR mutant lung cancer is the largest oncogene subset in which the bulk of previous studies have been done. However, all studies to date have been subsets of larger unselected patients (RADIANT study) or single arm studies (SELECT study). These smaller studies have shown a disease‐free survival benefit but have been underpowered to demonstrate a survival benefit. There are several well‐designed large studies ongoing that will definitively demonstrate whether adjuvant EGFR inhibitors improve overall survival. The ALCHEMIST study is a phase 3 randomized cooperative group study assessing erlotinib versus observation for patients with stage IB‐IIIA resected lung cancers; accrual is ongoing. The ADAURA study is a randomized phase 3 study where patients with stage IB‐IIIA resected lung cancers are randomized to osimertinib versus placebo for 3 years with a primary objective of DFS and a secondary objective of overall survival. These studies will help answer the question as to whether adjuvant targeted therapy should be utilized. PDL1 testing: In stage 3 lung cancers, more than 60 percent of patients will ultimately die of their lung cancer4. Adjuvant durvalumab has improved outcomes with a clear improvement in overall survival but many patients still recur and ultimately die of their disease. An unplanned subset analysis of the PACIFIC study suggests that patients with PDL1 0% expression may not derive benefit from durvalumab. Further assessment will be needed to ascertain whether PDL1 expression can be used to select patients who would derive benefit from adjuvant durvalumab. Due to their efficacy in the metastatic setting, there are a significant number of studies looking at immunotherapy as both neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment for locally advanced disease. Just as we utilize PDL1 as a biomarker that helps select appropriate therapies in the metastatic setting, I see similar use of PDL1 in the future in the locally advanced setting. Future directions: As personalized medicine infiltrates our care of patients with lung cancers, we will need biomarker results for patients with locally advanced lung cancer to better tailor and personalize their care. In particular, if the EGFR TKI studies demonstrate improved overall survival with adjuvant EGFR TKI, we will certainly need to incorporate biomarker testing as standard of care for locally advanced disease. In addition, because a significant portion of patients recur, already having molecular test results available which were done on their surgical sample, makes their care later more stream‐lined. We also need to assess whether PDL1 is a useful biomarker to select patients for immunotherapy in the adjuvant setting. Results from ongoing clinical trials will provide definitive answers.

abstract = {Background: Tislelizumab, a new high‐affinity programmed cell death protein‐1 (PD‐1) inhibitor, significantly prolonged the overall survival in pretreated non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study aimed to assess the cost‐effectiveness of tislelizumab versus docetaxel for this population in China. Methods: A three‐state partitioned survival model was developed to simulate advanced NSCLC. Efficacy and safety data were based on a global phase 3 clinical trial (RATIONALE 303). Utilities were mainly extracted from previously published resources. Costs were calculated from the Chinese healthcare system’s perspective, and only direct medical costs were covered. The main outcomes included total costs, life years (LYs), quality‐adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER). One‐way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were carried to test the uncertainty of the modeling results. In addition, several scenarios including tislelizumab price before negotiation, different docetaxel price calculation, 50‐year time horizon, and alternative utility values were assessed. Results: The model predicted an average gain of 0.62 LYs and 0.51 QALY for tislelizumab vs. docetaxel, at the additional cost of $9,219. The resulting ICER was $15,033.92/LY and $18,122.04/QALY, both below the cost‐effective threshold (CET) of three times gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in China. Sensitivity analyses showed that the results are robust over a plausible range for majority of inputs. Utility of progression‐free survival (PFS), followed by the price of tislelizumab, had the greatest impact on the ICER. The probability of being cost‐effective for tislelizumab was 96.79% at the CET we set. Conclusion: Tislelizumab improves survival, increases QALYs, and can be considered a cost‐effective option at current price compared with docetaxel for pretreated advanced NSCLC in China.},

abstract = {As first‐line therapy single agent pembrolizumab showed better outcomes than chemotherapy (CT) in patients with NSCLC and PD‐L1 expression ≥50% [1]. Recently has been published another phase 3 trial in which patients with aNSCLC with an expression of PD‐L1 ≥1%, treated with pembrolizumab as single agent, results in better overall survival (OS) than CT in first‐line, mainly in subgroup with PD‐L1 ≥50% [2]. After the approval and subsequent use of pembrolizumab as single agent in first‐line in NSCLC with PD‐L1 ≥50%, in 2018 several phase III trials explored the combination of immunotherapy agents (pembrolizumab and atezolizumab), with no regards of PD‐L1 status, in association with standard CT, gaining better outcomes than CT alone in first‐line NSCLC [3‐8]. A matter of debate is what we have to do in patients with PD‐L1 ≥50% due to the absent comparison between combination therapy and ICI as single agent and similar results in 1‐year OS among these treatments [1,3‐4]. So, why should we suggest the use of combination over ICIs as single agent in patients with PD‐L1 ≥50% in first‐line? First of all, we can see that trials of combination therapy report benefit with CT plus ICI across all PD‐L1 subgroups, with a greater magnitude of benefit in patients with PD‐L1 ≥50% with no regards of kind of drugs used (either CT and ICI) and histology (squamous or non‐squamous) [3‐8]. This magnitude of benefit is supported from an higher objective‐response rate (ORR) in patients treated with combination therapy over ICI as single agent in subgroups of patients with PD‐L1 ≥50% [1‐4], suggesting combination therapy as best choice even in patients with highly symptomatic disease with the purpose of obtaining a fast shrinkage of tumor. Analyzing Kaplan‐Meyer curves of single agent trials [1,2], you can observe that there is a violation of proportional hazard assumptions. We can see a crossing of the curves within first 3‐6 months suggesting us that there’s a subgroup of patients who have a worse prognosis when treated with single agent immunotherapy over CT. This worse prognosis could be possibly partially due to a phenomenon called hyperprogressive disease [9], a quicken tumor growth during treatment with ICIs in NSCLC irrespectively of the line of therapy. If we look at Kaplan‐Meyer curves of all combination studies, we can see that the combination of CT plus ICI abrogates the crossing curves [3,4,6,8], probably overcoming hyperprogessive disease with the addiction of CT by modulating tumor microenvironment. In subgroups of patients with liver and/or brain metastases, generally considered at worse prognosis, combination therapy demonstrates a benefit. In a retrospective analysis of KEYNOTE189 [10] were evaluated outcomes of patients with brain and/or liver metastases. In this analysis the addiction of pembrolizumab to CT grants a benefit over CT alone either in progression‐free survival, OS and ORR in patients with liver and/or brain metastases. Another evidence of benefit in patients with liver metastases in combination therapy was seen in IMpower150, in which the addiction of atezolizumab to bevacizumab plus CT seemed to add something even though there’s a bias due to the use of bevacizumab [5]. In advanced NSCLC treated with ICI as single agent [1,2] we see a lower benefit in non‐smoker than in current or former smoker patients, whilst in combination studies this difference isn’t seen regardless kind of drug and histology [3,6‐8]. Even gender may be a possible reason to choose combination instead of ICI as single agent. As we previously do for smoking habit, we indirectly compare trials with single agent and with combination. We can see that in KEYNOTE024 there’s a stronger benefit using pembrolizumab in males over females. This reported benefit for male patients is lost in combination treatment, with slight better outcomes in women instead, with no regards of drugs used and histology [3,4,6‐8]. Finally, basing on preclinical evidences, we know that the combination between CT and ICIs may enhance the immune system activity due to immunological effect of cytotoxic agents through the expression of PD‐L1 on the surface of tumor cells, the depletion of myeloid‐derived suppressor cells and T‐regulatory cells and the augmentation of the presentation of antigens by cancer cells [10]. At the state of the art the aim of our discussion remains an unanswered question but based on what we previously said, at least in patients with high tumor burden, in never smokers, we suggest CT plus ICI as first‐line in aNSCLC with PD‐L1 ≥50%. This could allow us not to lose patients in the first six months of treatment. [1] Reck M et al. Pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy for PD‐L1 positive non‐small cell lung cancer.

abstract = {Concurrent chemoradiation (cCRT) with platinum‐based chemotherapy is standard‐of‐care therapy for patients with stage III unresectable non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Although cCRT is potentially curative, 5‐year overall survival has hovered around 20%, despite extensive efforts to improve outcomes with increasing doses of conformal radiation and intensification of systemic therapy with either induction or consolidation chemotherapy. PD‐1/PD‐L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors have demonstrated unprecedented efficacy in patients with stage IV NSCLC. In addition, preclinical and early clinical evidence suggests that chemotherapy and radiation may work synergistically with anti‐PD‐1/PD‐L1 therapy to promote antitumor immunity, which has led to the initiation of clinical trials testing these drugs in patients with stage III NSCLC. A preliminary report of a randomized phase III trial, the PACIFIC trial, demonstrated an impressive increase in median progression‐free survival with consolidative durvalumab, a PD‐L1 inhibitor, compared with observation after cCRT. Here, we discuss the clinical and translational implications of integrating PD‐1/PD‐L1 inhibitors in the management of patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC.

abstract = {Purpose/Objective(s): To report the efficacy and toxicity outcomes of a prospective phase II trial of primary tumor SBRT followed by conventional chemoradiation to the lymph nodes and adjuvant immunotherapy in patients (pts) with unresectable LA NSCLC. Materials/Methods: Eligible pts included stage II‐III LA NSCLC with peripheral primary tumors ≤ 7cm or centrally based tumors that had at least 2 cm separation from involved nodal disease. Pts received SBRT to the primary tumor (50‐54 Gy in 3‐5 fractions) followed by standard radiation to 60 Gy in 30 fractions to the involved lymph nodes with concurrent platinum doublet chemotherapy. The trial was amended to allow pts without disease progression after chemoradiation to receive adjuvant durvalumab per the PACIFIC trial. The primary endpoint was 1 year progression free survival (PFS), evaluated as a binary variable. Frequencies and proportions were used for reporting this primary endpoint, in addition to adverse events and patterns of failure. Median PFS and OS were estimated using Kaplan Meier methods. Results: Safety and efficacy is reported on the first 50 pts enrolled in the trial with a median follow‐up of 24 months (mos) (range, 1‐54 mos). Pts were primarily stage IIIA (60%) or stage IIIB (34%), with 6% of pts stage IIB. Overall grade 3 or higher toxicity related to SBRT and/or mediastinal radiation was 8% with two pts (4%) developing grade 3 pneumonitis and one pt having a grade 5 lung infection possibly related to radiation. Overall grade 2 pneumonitis related to SBRT or mediastinal radiation was 20%. Only one pt (2%) developed grade 3 esophagitis. No late cardiac events have been observed. The one‐year PFS for all pts was 62% with a median PFS of 26.3 mos and median overall survival of 40.8 mos. Of the 50 pts enrolled, 37 received at least one dose of adjuvant durvalumab. The one‐year PFS for pts who received at least one dose of durvalumab was 70.3% with a median PFS not yet reached in this group (median follow‐up 24 mos). Patterns of failure were mostly distant with 26% of pts experiencing distant failure, 6% regional, and 2% distant and regional. There was only one local failure (2%) after SBRT in all 50 pts. Conclusion: SBRT to the primary tumor followed by conventional chemoradiation to the involved lymph nodes and adjuvant immunotherapy was well tolerated and showed improved 1‐year PFS compared to prior conventional chemoradiation trials for locally advanced NSCLC. The results of this trial will be further evaluated in a randomized phase III study, NRG LU‐008. Pts will receive either conventional chemoradiation vs. SBRT to the primary tumor followed by chemoradiation to the involved lymph nodes followed by consolidative immunotherapy to evaluate the possibility of utilization of SBRT as a new standard of care for LA NSCLC.},

abstract = {Cytotoxic chemotherapy has undeniably provided benefit for our patients with non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However its nondiscriminatory application based on general tumor biology principles and not on the underlying biology of lung cancer has hampered its ability to dramatically improve survival and cures for lung cancer. Over the last twenty years we have seen multiple examples of how molecular characterization of lung tumors coupled with advances in drug development, have led to astonishing improvements in cancer outcomes. Hence, it is time to set a course toward abandoning chemotherapy. In addition to their superior efficacy, targeted therapies and immunotherapy have milder toxicity profiles compared to chemotherapy that all patients appreciate. We have already made significant progress in this quest. Our journey began with the discovery of EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) mutations and their exquisite sensitivity to EGFR‐TKI (tyrosine kinase inhibitors). This observation was confirmed in the landmark IPASS trial that demonstrated the superiority of EGFR‐TKIs over platinum‐based chemotherapy for the first line treatment of patients whose tumors harbor these mutations.1 On the heels of this therapeutic advancement came the discovery of ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) gene rearrangements and the replacement of doublet chemotherapy with an ALKTKI in patients with ALK positive tumors.2 To date actionable driver mutations are found in at least 50% of patients with adenocarcinoma3 and inhibitors to all of these mutations are in clinical development with the hope that they will have similar success as their predecessors. Of particular interest is developing inhibitors to KRAS (V‐Ki‐ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog) because it is the most frequent driver mutation occurring in approximately 20‐25% of tumors. Today there is optimism that we will achieve this goal given it is the focus of the Stand Up To Cancer (SU2C) lung cancer dream team initiative and several novel agents are in development including direct KRAS therapy. Driver mutations are typically identified in patients who are never smokers, light former smokers or have a lengthy quit time. The remaining groups of patients' (i.e. current smoker or recent former smokers) have a different biology that has been successfully exploited with immunotherapy. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have replaced single agent docetaxel as the standard of care for second line treatment of lung cancer for all histological subtypes of NSCLC.4‐6 Most recently the KEYNOTE‐024 a randomized trial of pembrolizumab versus doublet chemotherapy for untreated patients with advanced NSCLC whose tumor have ≥ 50% PD‐L1 (programmed death‐ligand 1) IHC (immunohistochemistry) expression met its primary progression‐free survival (PFS) endpoint and also improved overall survival.7 This will represent a new standard of care for approximately 25% of patients and will serve as the backbone for immune combinations. We are anxiously awaiting the results of a randomized trial of a PD‐1 (programmed cell death protein 1) inhibitor plus a CTLA‐4 (cytotoxic T‐lymphocyte‐associated protein 4) inhibitor versus platinum‐based chemotherapy that is expected to report out in mid‐2017. A similar study is actively accruing patients. The preliminary results on this dual immune combination were very promising and if positive would increase the number of patients receiving upfront immune therapy over chemotherapy.8 Additionally, there are numerous immune combinations involving drugs that target immune evasion and even more drugs that stimulate the immune system including cellular therapies that are being evaluated. The success of targeted therapy and immunotherapy in the advanced setting has quickly led to their evaluation in earlier stages of disease. There is a lot of enthusiasm for combining immunotherapy with radiation for patients with locally advanced lung cancer given the well‐known immune modulatory effects of radiation. Moreover the bar for replacing weekly low dose concurrent chemotherapy with immunotherapy is low. In the adjuvant setting our Asian colleagues designed and conducted two randomized phase III trials in patients whose tumors have an EGFR sensitizing mutation to replace chemotherapy with an EGFR‐TKI. Accrual is completed and we are awaiting the results. In regard to immunotherapy, enrolling phase III trials are evaluating immune checkpoint inhibitors as maintenance therapy but the pursuit of immunotherapy as a replacement for chemotherapy will follow. Beyond treatment of lung cancer, on the horizon is the exploration of targeted agents and immunotherapy as preventive agents. It is important to emphasize that our current and future success is the consequence of many factors: 1) the exponential advances in technology that has driven the science and drug development 2) rapid trial accrual and 3) regulatory authorities' responsiveness to bringing efficacious treatments to patients as quickly as possible. This momentum is what will lead us to replacing chemotherapy for lung cancer. With 20%+ of patients with driver mutations and 25% of all NSCLC with high PD‐L1 already benefiting from non‐chemotherapy treatment, we are well on our way to ousting chemotherapy in NSCLC by 2030.},

abstract = {Introduction: Approximately one third of patients with non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are diagnosed with locally advanced disease (LA‐NSCLC). The standard treatment for patients with unresectable disease has been concurrent chemoradiation. The prognosis has been poor with median progression‐free survival of approximately 8 months and 15% 5‐year overall survival. The PACIFIC trial evaluated the effect of one year adjuvant treatment with durvalumab for patients who did not progress after chemoradiation, and presented favourable progression‐free survival for patients receiving durvalumab compared with placebo in September 2017. Methods: Following the first presentation of the PACIFIC‐data, a named‐patient use (NPU) program was established. From December 2017 to November 2018 a total of 41 patients were included in the program. Of these, 35 patients started treatment with durvalumab. After November 2019, durvalumab as implemented in routine practice. Results: Six patients included did not start durvalumab treatment. The reasons were: Progression, osteomyelitis, pneumonitis, poor performance status, discovery of a metastasis that was erroneously not detected during the initial diagnostic work‐up and surgery of the lung tumour. Of the 35 patients starting treatment with durvalumab, the mean days from completion of chemoradiation to start of durvalumab was 68 days, only 2 patients started earlier than 21 days. 19 patients (54%) completed one year of treatment. Of the 16 patients that discontinued treatment, eight stopped due to progression and eight due to side effects. The side effects leading to discontinuation were infusion reaction (n=1), fatigue (n=2), elevated liver enzymes (n=1), pneumonitis (n=3), worsening of psoriatic rash (n=1). Conclusion: Real‐world data of durvalumab adjuvant to chemoradiation was generally well tolerated. Completion of treatment was (54%) and comparable to that seen in the PACIFIC trial (49%). Time from end of chemoradiation to start of durvalumab treatment was longer than seen in the PACIFIC trial and also longer than seen after introduction of durvalumab in the routine practice. This was in line with recommendations in the NPU program. At the time, there was no data on the importance of early start of durvalumab. The time to start of durvalumab decreased during the program period. After introduction of durvalumab in routine treatment, most patients start within 3 weeks if they don’t have side effects that prevent an early start. Patients are followed with regards to future relapses and updates will be presented. Keywords: immunotherapy, durvalumab, chemoradiation},

abstract = {The treatment options for NSCLC patients with a limited number of metastases at diagnosis (oligometastatic disease) have increased the past decade. The focus lies at combining systemic‐ and local radical treatments. With the introduction of oligometastatic disease (OMD) as a separate entity, a more radical treatment approach is increasingly applied. For OMD we distinguish synchronous OMD (in case of OMD at diagnosis) and metachronous OMD (in case of a limited amount of metastases as first event of an initially locally limited disease). There is also the term oligometastatic progression in which case during systemic treatment of a pluri‐metastatic disease only few metastases progress. Finally, there could be a situation called oligo persistence in case of remaining metastatic lesions. The existing literature is seriously flawed by the lack of consensus on the definition of oligometastatic disease. Often a maximum of 2‐3 metastases are referred to as oligometastatic disease, but ≤5 metastases are also selected and considered for radical treatment. Important developments of local consolidative therapies in OMD Since 2016 several retrospective and prospective trials reported favorable progression free survival (PFS) for OMD treated with systemic therapy followed by local consolidative therapy (LCT). The intrathoracic disease is generally locally treated with radical radiotherapy or resection. Treatment of the metastases consists of radical or stereotactic radiotherapy, surgical resection or local ablative therapies. In an observational study radical local treatment for a selected group of NSCLC patients (n=91) with good performance status presenting with synchronous oligometastatic disease resulted in 14 months PFS and 32 months overall survival (OS). These results are comparable to outcomes for stage III NSCLC disease. De Ruysscher et.al. [2] reported a prospective single arm phase II study for synchronous oligometastatic disease treated with radical local treatment (radiotherapy or surgery) after first line chemotherapy. The median PFS and OS in this study were 12.1 months and 13.5 months respectively. After 24 months 15% of the patients did not show disease progression. In a trial Iyengar et al [4] randomized 29 metastatic NSCLC patients with up to 6 sites of extracranial disease (including primary) and a good performance. After induction chemotherapy non‐progressive patients were randomized for maintenance chemotherapy or stereotactic radiotherapy. In an unplanned interim analysis, the median PFS was 9.7 months in the stereotactic radiotherapy arm versus 3.5 months in the maintenance chemotherapy arm. In a randomized phase II trial Gomez included 49 patients with stage IV NSCLC with three or fewer metastases, and no progression after first‐line systemic therapy. The trial investigated LCT with stereotactic or conventionally fractionated radiotherapy or surgery versus maintenance therapy or observation. Patients in the LCT arm experienced improved PFS as well as improved OS [5].The trial was closed early because of a significant PFS and OS benefit in the LCT arm. With a median follow‐up time of 38.8 months the PFS benefit with additional local therapy was 14.2 months versus 4.4 months in the maintenance therapy/observation arm (p=0.022). They also reported an impressive OS benefit in the LCT arm: 41.2 months versus 17.0 months (p=0.017). This OS benefit was achieved despite the fact that 41% of the patients in the maintenance therapy/observation arm crossed over to the local consolidative therapy arm at the time of progression. No additional grade 3 or greater toxicities were observed. It is important to know that these studies were performed in the pre‐immunotherapy era. In patients with metachronous OMD (controlled primary tumour and 1‐5 oligometastatic lesions) the effect of LCT on survival, toxicity, and quality of life in 99 patients was recently reported in the SABR‐COMET trial: a randomized, phase 2 trial [4]. Patients were randomly assigned (1:2) to receive either palliative standard of care treatments alone (control group), or standard of care plus stereotactic or conventional radiotherapy to all metastatic lesions (SABR group). Median overall survival was 28 months in the control group versus 41 months in the SABR group (p=0.090). Several reasons could explain the benefit by adding LCT for OMD in these trials: 1) LCT potentiates the effects of systemic therapy 2) By reducing the residual tumor burden, LCT delays the growth of distant micrometastatic disease 3) LCT reduced the amount of treatment‐resistant lung cancer cells 4) Necrosis caused by LCT allows the immune system to induce an immune‐specific reaction that affects distant cancer cells Conclusion: The synergy of local consolidative therapies combined with systemic treatments in oligometastatic patients is currently one of the most exciting developments in lung cancer treatment.

abstract = {Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) of the undifferentiated histology is endemic in southern China and southeast Asia including Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia, with a peak annual incidence of up to 30 per 100,000 persons. According to global cancer registry, NPC ranked 11th most common among all malignancies in China in 2008 with an incidence of 2.8/100,000 person‐years in men and 1.9/100,000 person‐years in females. It is highly associated with prior infection with Epstein‐Barr virus and thus it is a highly immune‐related malignancy. Treatment strategy is mainly based on the disease stage according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)/Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) staging system. In general, stage I‐II diseases are treated with radiation therapy alone while stage III‐IV diseases are treated with concurrent chemoradiation with or without adjunct chemotherapy (induction or adjuvant). Intensive pretreatment workup including blood hematology and biochemistry, dedicated head and neck imaging with computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging and positron‐emission tomography with integrated computed tomography (PET‐CT) and plasma Epstein‐Barr virus (EBV) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) are essential in high‐risk locoregionally advanced diseases to confirm non‐metastatic diseases, since the treatment protocol and overall prognosis between locoregionally advanced (stage III‐IVA) disease differ significantly from metastatic disease. Despite intensive radical treatment in the contemporary radiotherapy era with concurrent chemoradiation with or without adjunct chemotherapy, between 15% and 30% of these patients with stage III‐IVA disease develop metastatic diseases at distant sites. Further systemic chemotherapy following radical concurrent chemoradiation may not bring survival benefits, attributed by the compromised physique following intensive radical concurrent chemoradiation and the prolonged treatment‐related toxicities brought by adjuvant chemotherapy. The recent Hong Kong NPC Study Group NPC‐0502 study failed to show survival benefit in patients with post‐treatment detectable plasma EBV DNA after a further 6 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy compared to those who just observed after radical concurrent chemoradiation. On the other hand, induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiation may be the more preferred regimen due to the perceived efficacy of eradication of tumor micro‐metastasis and early shrinkage of primary tumor and bulky neck nodes, which allow a more radical radiotherapy dose and better coverage of both the primary tumor and neck nodes. Very recently, a China multi‐centre phase III randomised‐controlled trial demonstrated an improvement in recurrence‐free survival and overall survival (OS) with induction chemotherapy gemcitabine plus cisplatin followed by concurrent chemoradiation versus concurrent chemoradiation alone. Nevertheless, new treatment strategies must be developed to improve treatment outcomes of these high‐risk patients with stage III‐IVA disease, which has become the major research focus in the past decade. A recent meta‐analysis demonstrated that induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiation improved overall survival compared to concurrent chemoradiation in the era of modern radiotherapy with intensity‐modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Immune checkpoint inhibitors are now comprehensively and extensively tested in combination with radiotherapy (RT) as well (NCT01935921, NCT01860430). It has been recently known that RT increases the expression of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). In turn, the MHC class‐I restricted tumor antigen‐specific cells elicited by RT will upregulate interferons in the tumors. This radiation‐induced local inflammation and tumor‐specific effector T cells will provide an additional mechanism for tumor control by modification of the tumor vasculature. In addition, RT will increase dendritic cell surface antigen presentation to T cells and production of cytokines leading to recruitment and activation of leucocytes from peripheral blood and extravasation to tumor parenchyma. These are part of the mechanisms of abscopal effect, a phenomenon where the tumors at the sites far away from the irradiated sites also regress after localized radiotherapy. Having learnt from the pivotal PACIFIC trial on the use of consolidation therapy with durvalumab (anti‐PD‐L1 monoclonal antibody) which confirmed the efficacy and safety of combination of chemoradiation and immunotherapy for stage III non‐small‐cell lung cancer, it is prime time to consider incorporation of immune checkpoint inhibitors into concurrent chemoradiation for other solid tumors like head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and NPC. In concurrent +/‐ adjuvant setting for locoregionally advanced NPC, there are at least two clinical trials on immune checkpoint inhibitors for locoregionally advanced disease. The first one is a phase II single‐arm study using nivolumab in combination with concurrent chemoradiation with or without by adjuvant nivolumab for up to 3 months at different dose schedules (NCT03267498). A phase III multi‐center randomized‐controlled trial (RCT) in China on the use of a locally‐manufactured PD‐1 monoclonal antibody (SHR‐1210) every 4 weeks for 12 cycles starting at 4‐6 weeks after concurrent chemoradiation for stage III‐IVA NPC versus no adjuvant therapy is currently under way (NCT03427827). It is highly expected and eagerly awaited that immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors will bring a new insight on the adjuvant treatment for NPC. In view of the above with promising synergy between radiation therapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors, the investigators propose a phase II RCT on adding durvalumab in combination with induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiation and adjuvant durvalumab for previously untreated locoregionally advanced NPC. In parallel, the investigators will also perform collateral tumor and serum biomarker studies which will be correlated with the treatment response. The investigators will collect fresh tumour biopsies at pretreatment, then serially after induction chemotherapy and after concurrent chemoradiation to investigate the change in microenvironment of the tumour and the surrounding inflammatory cells before and after durvalumab. In addition, the investigators will also measure the change in number and intensity of PD‐L1‐positive circulating tumour cells before and after durvalumab and evaluate their correlation with treatment response.},

abstract = {Background: Currently there are no approved maintenance therapies for patients (pts) with unresected LA‐HNSCC following definitive cCRT. The PD‐1 inhibitors pembrolizumab and nivolumab are licensed for treatment of pts with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC who have progressed on or after a platinum‐based therapy. Dual inhibition of CTLA‐4 and PD‐L1 is approved in solid tumors including renal cell carcinoma (RCC), NSCLC, and melanoma, and has shown a numerical trend towards improved survival in first‐line pts with recurrent/metastatic HNSCC whose tumors express PD‐L1. Volrustomig (MEDI5752) is a monovalent, PD‐1/CTLA‐4 bispecific, humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody engineered to specifically inhibit PD‐1, with increased CTLA‐4 blockade on PD‐1+ activated T cells compared to PD‐1‐ resting peripheral T cells. In a first‐in‐human phase 1/2 study (NCT03530397), volrustomig monotherapy showed promising efficacy with acceptable tolerability in advanced clear cell RCC and in combination with chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC. The phase 3, randomized, open‐label, multicenter, eVOLVE‐HNSCC study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of sequential therapy with volrustomig compared with observation in pts with unresected LA‐HNSCC who have not progressed after receiving definitive cCRT (NCT06129864). Methods: Key eligibility criteria include histologically or cytologically confirmed, unresected LA‐HNSCC with no evidence of metastatic disease, i.e. AJCC 8th edition(TNMstaging system) stage IVA/B cancers of the hypopharynx, oral cavity, larynx or HPV‐negative oropharynx, or stage III HPV‐positive oropharynx cancer; age ≥18 years; WHO/ECOG performance score of 0 or 1; and adequate organ and bone marrow function. Key exclusion criteria include requiring further treatment with curative intent after definitive cCRT, resected LA‐HNSCC, recurrent/metastatic disease, and >1 primary tumor. Following initial screening and definitive cCRT (cisplatin or carboplatin + paclitaxel or carboplatin + 5‐FU, plus concomitant radiotherapy), approximately 1145 pts whose disease has not progressed within 12 weeks of the last dose of cCRT will be randomized 1:1 to Arm A or B. Arm A will receive volrustomig intravenously every 3 weeks for a maximum of 12 months or 18 cycles, or until RECIST v1.1‐defined radiological progressive disease (PD) or unacceptable toxicity. Arm B will undergo observation for a maximum of 12 months or until PD. The primary endpoint is PFS in pts with PD‐L1‐expressing tumors. Secondary endpoints include PFS in all randomized pts, OS in pts with PD‐L1‐expressing tumors and in all randomized pts, PFS2, safety, patientreported outcomes, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity. Exploratory biomarker analyses will also be conducted. Enrollment began in December 2023.},

abstract = {Background: Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer mortality throughout the world with an incidence exceeding 1.2 million. 70% of NSCLC patients present with incurable disease with treatment aimed at alleviating symptoms, maintaining / improving quality of life as well as prolonging survival. In the last decade there have been dramatic changes in systemic therapy (chemotherapy, immunotherapy, Tyrosine kinase Inhibitors (TKIs)). Despite these advances, many patients suffer from lororegional symptomatic relapse. This may benefit from local radiotherapy in addition to other standards of care such as symptom control. Radiotherapy remains widely used in the management of stage IV NSCLC but strategies vary hugely because the data originates from a series of dose fractionations trials in the 1990s when systemic therapy options were limited. There is therefore limited evidence regarding the use and place of palliative radiotherapy in conjunction with modern systemic treatments and there is a need to assess benefits of advanced radiotherapy techniques in this population. The TOURIST trial aims to establish the utility of palliative thoracic radiotherapy in the primary treatment of stage IV NSCLC. Method: This is a phase III platform that currently has 2 study arms, to cover the needs of differing patient populations, defined by the use of first line systemic therapy. Study 1 (PRINCE) Patients receiving first line systemic therapy as standard of care, who have not progressed after 2‐4 cycles are randomised 1:1 to either high dose palliative radiotherapy to the thorax, or to no radiotherapy while continuing on their standard systemic therapy. Co‐primary endpoints: overall survival, PROMs recorded QOL, with progression free survival and time to next line of therapy, as secondary endpoints. Study 2 (QUARTZ Lung) Asymptomatic patients unsuitable for standard systemic therapy randomised 1:1 to low dose palliative radiotherapy dose to the thorax or no radiotherapy. Telephone follow up will be used for PROMs data collection to measure QOL improvements. Stratification factors for both studies will include bulk of thoracic disease, use of advanced radiotherapy techniques and performance status. The TOURIST trial intends to recruit 750 patients and is anticipated to open in 2020.

Materials/Methods: Stage IIIA‐IIIC NSCLC patients were prospectively enrolled in a prospective total body PETCT study (NCT04654234, GASTO‐1067) and a randomized phase II clinical trial (NCT04085250) between September 2020 and December 2020. Patients underwent a dynamic total‐body 18F‐FDG PET/CT scan before any treatment, after 2 cycles of induction chemo‐immunotherapy (docetaxel + cisplatin + nivolumab), then after CCRT. The primary lung tumor, metastatic regional lymph node and inflammatory lymph node before and after treatment were manually delineated by a nuclear medicine physician and a radiation oncologist. Total Body PET was acquired between 0 – 60 mins after the injection of FDG from the subject's feet. Patients was separated into high dynamic FDG metabolic (H‐DFM) group and low DFM(L‐DFM) group by the scatter plot of SUV‐mean and Ki‐mean of baseline scan for primary lung tumor. We compared lesion heterogeneity and different image‐derived PET metrics including the metabolic tumor volume (MTV), SUV total lesion glycolysis (SUV‐TLG), Patlak‐derived influx rate constant (Ki) TLG (Ki‐TLG). Results: Fifteen patients completed three scans (before treatment, after induction chemo‐immunotherapy, after CCRT). Eight patients were in H‐DFM group and 7 in L‐DFM group by baseline scan. Patients in H‐DFM group had significant decreased levels of MTV (P < 0.001), SUV‐TLG (P < 0.001) and Ki‐TLG (P < 0.001) both in primary lung tumor and metastatic lymph node by the induction chemo‐immunotherapy and CCRT. However, patients in L‐DFM group only had a significant reduction of MTV in primary lung tumor (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the MTV of metastatic lymph node (P > 0.5), the SUV‐TLG (P > 0.5) and Ki‐TLG (P > 0.5) of primary lung tumor and metastatic lymph node during the treatment course in L‐DFM group. Conclusion: Patients in H‐DFM group had the better treatment response of induction chemo‐immunotherapy and CCRT with significant decreased levels of MTV, SUV‐TLG and Ki‐TLG. Dynamic 18F‐FDG Total body PET Imaging could be regarded as a potential predictive marker of induction chemo‐immunotherapy and CCRT response in the setting of LA‐NSCLC.},

abstract = {Introduction: Agents which inhibit the programmed death receptor‐1 (anti–PD‐1) have transformed treatment for patients with metastatic non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), however there is paucity of prospective clinical data investigating the use of these agents in patients with locally advanced NSCLC (laNSCLC) who are not candidates for definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy. In the Phase 3 EMPOWER‐Lung 1 Study (NCT03088540), cemiplimab, a PD‐1 inhibitor, demonstrated improved overall survival (OS) and progression‐free survival (PFS) in patients with advanced NSCLC and programmed cell death‐ligand 1 (PD‐L1) expression in ≥50% of tumor cells vs platinum‐doublet chemotherapy. This study allowed the enrollment of patients with laNSCLC, in addition to those with metastatic disease, providing the largest prospective randomized evidence of first‐line (1L) anti–PD‐1 monotherapy in this patient population. Here, we present a post‐hoc subgroup analysis of patients with laNSCLC from the PD‐L1 ≥50% population in EMPOWER‐Lung 1. Methods: In EMPOWER‐Lung 1, patients were randomized 1:1 to cemiplimab 350 mg intravenous every 3 weeks or investigator’s choice of platinum‐doublet chemotherapy. Patients with laNSCLC were those with stage 3B/3C disease who were not candidates for definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Data cut‐off for this subgroup analysis was March 1, 2020. Results: In the PD‐L1 ≥50% population of EMPOWER‐Lung 1 (n=563), 87 (15.5%) patients had laNSCLC; cemiplimab (n=45) and chemotherapy (n=42). In the total laNSCLC population (n=87), median (range) age was 63.0 (31.0–81.0); male: 86.2%; non‐squamous histology: 36.8%; stage 3B cancer: 79.3%; and stage 3C cancer: 20.7%. At a median follow‐up of 11.6 months (interquartile range 7.2–18.2 months), cemiplimab provided significantly better PFS vs chemotherapy and numerically longer OS (not reaching statistical significance) (see Table). Objective response rates (ORR) and Kaplan–Meier estimated median duration of response (DOR) were also numerically improved with cemiplimab vs chemotherapy. Conclusion: In patients with laNSCLC and with PD‐L1 ≥50%, 1L cemiplimab monotherapy demonstrated a significant improvement in PFS, numerically longer OS, and numerically better ORR and DOR vs chemotherapy. These results support clinical benefit provided by cemiplimab 1L monotherapy for patients with laNSCLC with PD‐L1 ≥50%.

abstract = {Introduction: Platinum‐containing chemotherapy represents one treatment opportunity for patients with advanced squamous NSCLC. With respect to comorbidities and decreased performance status, frequently seen in patients with sNSCLC novel effective and well tolerable treatment opportunities are required to enhance efficacy of systemic treatment. The PRIMUS trial was conducted to explore the potential of pembrolizumab maintenance treatment after induction treatment with platinum‐based chemotherapy. Methods: In this phase II multi‐center, double‐blind trial, patients with stage IV squamous NSCLC and at least stable disease after at least 2 cycles of first‐line chemotherapy with cisplatin or carboplatin were randomized 1:1 between Q3W maintenance treatment with pembrolizumab 200 mg and placebo, respectively. Patients were included irrespective of tumor PD‐L1 expression. Maximum treatment duration was 2 years. The primary endpoint was progression‐free survival (PFS) measured from randomization, secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS) measured from randomization, PD‐L1 expression in tumor samples, safety and tolerability, and quality of life by FACT‐L and LCSS questionnaires. Results: Planned patient enrollment of 65 per arm was not met due to changes of clinical treatment standards for first‐line treatment. Pembrolizumab (P) maintenance was administered to 16 patients, while 18 patients received placebo (Pla). Survival results favor P maintenance over placebo: Median PFS with P was 9.5 mo [95% CI 1.5‐23.5] versus 4.8 mo [95% CI 1.8‐10.5] with Pla. PFS rate at 6, 12 and 18 months was 50.3% [95% CI 23.1‐72.4%], 35.9% [95% CI 13.1‐59.6%] and 35.9% [95% CI 13.1‐59.6%] with P and 36.1% [95% CI 15.0‐57.9%], 18.1% [95% CI 4.5‐39.0%] and 9.0% [95% CI 0.7‐30.9%] with Pla. Median OS was 24.0 mo [95% CI 9.5‐30.9] with P and 10.9 mo [95% CI 4.8‐39.2] with Pla. OS rates at 6 and 12 months were 86.7% [95% CI 56.4‐96.5%] and 79.4% [95% CI 48.8‐92.9%] with P versus 69.3% [95% CI 41.1‐ 85.9] and 44.1% [95% CI 20.0‐65.9%] with Pla. Response and SD from start of maintenance: 11.1% vs 14.4% and 42.3% vs 23.1% (P vs Pla). AEs ≥ grade 3 potentially related to P according to investigator assessment occurred in 4 patients: grade 3 hyperthyreosis, myocarditis, nephritis and acute renal failure, and grade 4 bronchopulmonary hemorrhage. Conclusions: Our results indicate a notable benefit of the pembrolizumab maintenance strategy compared to placebo maintenance treatment, both in terms of PFS and OS. This is a remarkable finding given that the number of treated patients was considerably lower than planned. Further exploration is warranted.

abstract = {Introduction: Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer‐related deaths world‐wide. Approximately one third of patients with non–small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are diagnosed with locally advanced disease (stage III) at diagnosis1, for whom the standard of care is platinum‐based doublet chemotherapy concurrent with radiotherapy resulting in 5‐year survival of 15‐20%. In the PACIFIC study, a superior outcome was observed for patients receiving the checkpoint inhibitor durvalumab after chemoradiation2. The median progression‐free survival from randomization was 16.8 month with durvalumab versus 5.6 months with placebo (p<0.001). The benefit was found in the intention to treat‐population, and PD‐L1 expression was not a good predictive biomarker. Despite impressive results, many patients relapsed, and more knowledge of the biology underlying responses and resistance is needed. Durvalumab is approved by the FDA for patients regardless of PD‐L1 status, while EMA limited the indication to patients whose tumours harbour PD‐L1 expression of ≥1%. Methods: This is an investigator initiated, multi‐centre phase II translational study. A total of 100 stage III NSCLC patients not progressing after chemoradiotherapy will be included from the Nordic and Baltic countries, 50 PD‐L1 negative and 50 PD‐L1 positive patients. Astra Zeneca provides durvalumab for all patients. The DART trial aims to identify prognostic and predictive biomarkers which may be used to identify patients who would benefit from durvalumab after chemoradiation. Our hypothesis is that the immunological microenvironment in the tumour influences response. Tumour biopsies will be collected before treatment, after chemoradiation and at progression. Blood and stool samples will be collected and images will be performed before and during treatment as well as during follow‐up. The analyses planned are described below linked to the study objectives Primary objectives: To investigate the immunological response, tumour development (if present) and dynamics in the tumour micro‐environment and in circulation. This includes the following: ‐ Evaluation of immune cell infiltration in the primary tumour and in the relapse tumour (if present) ‐ Evaluation of circulating biomarkers related to tumour (ctDNA) and host response (immune cells) ‐ Evaluations of genomic characteristics of the primary tumour and the relapse (if present) To investigate tumour mutational burden in tumour tissue and blood samples, as predictors for clinical response To evaluate imaging protocols for response prediction. PET‐CT will be done for screening, after chemoradiation and after 12 months. To investigate potential changes in gut microbiota in serial samples from patients treated with durvalumab and investigate whether microbiota profile prior to, or dynamic changes during treatment can predict clinical outcome Secondary objectives: To evaluate toxicity and quality of life in lung cancer patients receiving PDL1‐inhibitor after chemoradiotherapy To evaluate progression‐free survival and overall survival References 1.

abstract = {Background: In China, platinum‐based doublet chemotherapy is the standard treatment for patients who have unresectable stage III non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), administered with radiotherapy on either a concurrent or sequential basis. However, NSCLC patients who undergo this treatment can expect poor median progression‐free survival (PFS) of around 8‐10 months and a dismal 5‐year overall survival (OS) rate of about 15%. In the recent PACIFIC trial, durvalumab was demonstrated to hold significant clinical benefit for patients with locally advanced/unresectable NSCLC who experienced no disease progression after definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy (cCRT). CS1001 is the first full‐length, fully human immunoglobin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody (mAb) that targets programmed death ligand‐1 (PD‐L1) created through the OMT transgenic rat platform. The phase Ia/Ib study indicated CS1001 was well tolerated and exhibited anti‐tumor potential with a range of tumors. GEMSTONE‐301 is a phase III randomized, double‐blind, study to explore the efficacy and safety of CS1001 compared with a placebo as consolidation therapy for stage III unresectable NSCLC patients. Methods: In this trial, eligible patients will be randomized to receive CS1001 1,200 mg or placebo, every 3 weeks (Q3W). The primary endpoint will be investigator‐assessed PFS, based on the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. The secondary endpoints will include OS, PFS assessment based on Blinded Independent Center Review (BICR), objective response rate (ORR), other efficacy measurements, safety, and tolerability. Discussion: This phase III trial will determine the efficacy and safety of CS1001 as consolidation therapy in patients with locally advanced/unresectable (stage III) NSCLC who did not have disease progression after prior concurrent/sequential chemoradiotherapy (cCRT or sCRT), and is the first phase III trial on an anti‐PD‐L1 mAb initiated in China for this indication.

abstract = {In this article, we summarize our personal non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) highlights from the ESMO 2022 meeting, covering developments in early‐ and advanced‐stage NSCLC. In early‐stage disease, many studies underlined possibilities of neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment, including neoadjuvant immunotherapy combination strategies (INCREASE trial) or adjuvant targeted therapy with osimertinib in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)‐mutated NSCLC (updated results of ADAURA), both promoting interesting concepts to further improve outcomes in early‐stage NSCLC. In late‐stage disease, results from CodeBreak200, the first randomized phase III trial investigating the selective KRAS‐G12C inhibitor sotorasib, define this agent as the new standard‐of‐care in a molecular‐defined patient population after progression on platinum‐doublet and immunotherapy. The IPSOS study supports atezolizumab as preferred first‐line therapy in unfit older patients.},

abstract = {Background: GBM, the most common adult primary brain tumor, has an aggressive clinical course and a poor prognosis. Approximately 40% of pts with GBM have tumors with a methylated MGMT gene promoter, which is associated with DNA repair. In these pts, TMZ may induce DNA damage and cell death due to silencing of the MGMT promoter, a mechanism potentially augmented by combination with checkpoint inhibitors. Nivolumab, a fully human IgG4 monoclonal antibody to the programmed death‐1 receptor, has demonstrated overall survival (OS) benefit in the treatment of metastatic melanoma, non‐small cell lung cancer, and advanced renal cell carcinoma. CheckMate‐548 (NCT02667587) is a phase 2, randomized, single‐blind study evaluating the efficacy and safety of TMZ/RT ‐> TMZ with nivolumab or PBO in pts with newly diagnosed MGMT‐methylated GBM. In a companion phase 3 trial (CheckMate‐498; NCT02617589), eligible pts with MGMT‐unmethylated tumors (N = 550) will be randomized to receive nivolumab + RT followed by nivolumab, or TMZ/RT ‐> TMZ, with OS as the primary endpoint. Trial design: Eligibility criteria include newly diagnosed, histologically confirmed supratentorial GBM in pts aged ≥18 years with Karnofsky performance status ≥70, and a tumor test result that shows a MGMT methylated, partially methylated, or indeterminate methylation type. Pts previously treated for GBM other than by resection and those with recurrent or secondary GBM are ineligible. Approximately 320 pts, stratified by partial or complete resection, will be randomized 1:1 to receive TMZ/RT ‐> TMZ in combination with nivolumab or PBO. Treatment will continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary objective is OS in pts treated with TMZ/RT ‐> TMZ and nivolumab versus TMZ/RT ‐> TMZ and PBO; the secondary objective is progression‐free survival. Select exploratory objectives include safety, biomarker analyses, and neurocognitive outcomes. In the follow‐up period, safety and tolerability, tumor progression, and survival will be evaluated.},

abstract = {Background: There is emerging recognition of the positive impact of exercise in cancer management. Currently, there are several clinical trials underway in different types of cancers assessing the impact of exercise on cancer treatment outcomes, including overall survival. Exercise has also been proposed to help with cancer‐related fatigue. Stage IIIA/B locally advanced non‐small cell cancers are generally treated with definitive (curative) chemoradiation. Although the recent introduction of maintenance immunotherapy (durvalumab) has improved outcomes, overall long‐term survival remains unsatisfactory. We plan to study the role of exercise in a group of lung cancer patients. We propose to conduct a prospective feasibility study incorporating supervised exercise program in lung cancer patients receiving definitive chemoradiation. Successful feasibility as demonstrated by this study is expected to lead to a larger randomized trial exploring the said benefits of exercise. Aims: To establish the feasibility of supervised exercise program in patients who are receiving definitive chemoradiation for lung cancer. Methods: Twenty eligible patients will be identified through lung multidisciplinary meetings and recruited to the study. We aim to administer 45 min of tailored exercise program for three sessions in a week. The exercise sessions will be conducted at The Kaden Centre under the supervision of a qualified physiotherapist. The program will begin 2 weeks prior to commencement of treatment and continue throughout the chemoradiation and beyond to a total of 10 weeks. We will document modified Glasgow prognostic score and neutrophil leucocyte ratio at three timepoints on the study ‐ prior to entering the exercise program, prior to starting chemoradiation, and 4 weeks after completion of treatment. Demographic data would also be collected. Other than the exercise program, the clinical care of patients and their long‐term follow up will be as per existing practice. Statistics:Wewill use only descriptive statistics given the small sample size and nature of the study.We expect that at least 14 patients completing minimum of 15 sessions on the program would demonstrate feasibility and allow us to continue to a larger study.We will also document the proportion of the patients who were approached to participate in the study and declined. Current status of the study: Protocol writing.},

abstract = {Introduction: Immunotherapy has become standard therapy for advanced non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, no direct comparison between different PD‐1 inhibitors were reported. Methods: This is an open label, randomized, phase II clinical trial to compare sintilimab versus pembrolizumab as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy for treatment naïve local advanced or metastatic NSCLC. Eligible patients were EGFR or ALK negative. Patients with asymptomatic brain metastasis were allowed. PD‐L1 tumor proportion score (TPS) ≥50% patients were randomly assigned to sintilimab (A) or pembrolizumab (B) monotherapy arms. TPS<50% patients were randomly assigned to sintilimab (C) or pembrolizumab (D) with platin‐based chemotherapy arms. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR). Sample size were determined per Optimal Two‐Stage Design, 1st stage would recruit 20 patients. Recruitment of the 2nd stage would start if ≥4 patients achieve partial response (PR) in sintilimab arms, and sample size would be determined based on the ORR of the 1st. Results: The ORR of the 1st stage was 57.1% in sintilimab and 33.3% in pembrolizumab arms, thus the study successfully entered into the 2nd stage. From Mar. 2020 to Jan. 2022, a total of 68 patients were enrolled. Histologic subtypes and brain metastasis were well balanced between arms. Until Dec. 31st 2021, the median follow‐up was 5.6 months. ORR was 57.6% in sintilimab arms vs. 42.9% in pembrolizumab arms, and the confirmed ORR was 45.5% (15/33) vs. 28.6% (10/35), separately. (Figure 1). The disease control rate was 87.9% vs. 91.4% in sintilimab and pembrolizumab arms, respectively. The primary endpoint was reached, with 15 confirmed PRs achieved in sintilimab arms. Survival data was still immature. Treatment‐related adverse events were comparable between sintilimab and pembrolizumab arms (Table 1). Conclusions: This head‐to‐head study of PD‐1 inhibitors suggested comparable tumor response and similar safety profile between sintilimab and pembrolizumab.

abstract = {Background Patients (pts) with unresectable locally advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (laNSCLC) who are not candidates for concurrent chemoradiation have often been excluded from immunotherapy trials, and their care represent an unmet medical need. We report post hoc analyses of pts with laNSCLC who received cemiplimab (anti–programmed cell death‐1) from two phase III clinical trials with long‐term data. Methods EMPOWER‐Lung 1 and EMPOWER‐Lung 3 included pts with squamous or non‐squamous NSCLC that was metastatic or locally advanced (not suitable for definitive concurrent chemoradiation) without EGFR, ALK or ROS1 genomic aberrations. In EMPOWER‐Lung 1 pts were randomised 1:1 to first‐line (1L) cemiplimab monotherapy or chemo for NSCLC with ≥50% programmed cell death‐ligand 1 (PD‐L1) expression. In EMPOWER‐Lung 3 pts were randomised 2:1 to 1L cemiplimab + chemo or placebo + chemo regardless of PD‐L1 expression level. Results In each trial, 15% of pts were treated for laNSCLC. In EMPOWER‐Lung 1, at 3‐year follow‐up of pts with laNSCLC, 1L cemiplimab monotherapy led to a median overall survival (OS) of 26.1 vs 13.9 mo with chemo (HR: 0.67; 0.38–1.17; p = 0.1532). Progression‐free survival (PFS) was 8.1 vs 6.2 mo (HR: 0.56; 0.34–0.95; p = 0.0286). Objective response rate (ORR) was 49% vs 31%. Median duration of response (DOR) was 18.8 vs 6.2 mo. In EMPOWER‐Lung 3, at 2‐year follow‐up of pts with laNSCLC, greater efficacy was observed with 1L cemiplimab + chemo vs placebo + chemo. Median OS was 24.1 vs 13.8 mo (HR: 0.50; 0.27–0.95; p = 0.0293) and median PFS was 12.5 vs 6.2 mo (HR: 0.34; 0.19–0.61; p = 0.0002). ORR was 58% vs 29%. Median DOR was 27.8 vs 4.2 mo. [Formula presented] Conclusions Long‐term follow‐up data from EMPOWER‐Lung studies continue to suggest clinical benefit of 1L cemiplimab as monotherapy or in combination with platinum‐based chemo in pts with unresectable laNSCLC who are not candidates for definitive concurrent chemoradiation.

abstract = {Locally advanced non‐small lung cancer encompasses a diverse range of tumors. In the last few years, the treatment of stage III unresectable non‐small lung cancer has evolved significantly. The PACIFIC trial opened a new therapeutic era in the treatment of locally advanced NSCLC, establishing durvalumab consolidation therapy as the new standard of care worldwide. A careful evaluation of this type of lung cancer and a discussion of the management of these patients within a multidisciplinary team represents a crucial step in defining the best treatment strategy for each patient. For unresectable stage III NSCLC, definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) was historically recommended as a treatment with a 5‐year survival rate ranging from 20% to 30%. The PACIFIC study conducted in 2017 compared the use of chemoradiotherapy and maintenance therapy with the anti‐PD‐L1 monoclonal antibody durvalumab to a placebo in patients with locally advanced NSCLC who had not experienced disease progression. The study was prospective, randomized, and phase III. The administration of this medication in patients with locally advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has demonstrated a notable improvement in overall survival. Multiple clinical trials are currently exploring various immune checkpoint inhibition regimens to enhance the treatment efficacy in patients with stage III cancer. Our goal is to offer an up‐to‐date summary of the planned clinical trials for treatment options, focusing on the significant obstacles and prospects in the post‐PACIFIC era.},

abstract = {Introduction: In RATIONALE‐303 (NCT03358875) tislelizumab significantly improved OS vs docetaxel in the ITT population at the interim analysis (IA), based upon which, tislelizumab was approved in China for treatment of advanced NSCLC patients with progressive disease after chemotherapy. Here, we report outcomes of the final analysis (FA) and post hoc biomarker analysis. Methods: Patients ≥18 years with histologically confirmed, locally advanced or metastatic squamous or non‐squamous NSCLC were randomized (2:1) to IV tislelizumab 200 mg or IV docetaxel 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks. Co‐primary endpoints were OS in the ITT and PD‐L1 TC ≥25% populations. The study had one planned IA only in the ITT population. The FA was conducted in the PD‐L1 TC ≥25% population with secondary endpoints (PFSINV, ORRINV, DoRINV) tested sequentially once superiority of OS in PD‐L1 TC ≥25% population was demonstrated in the FA. Exploratory biomarker analyses included PD‐L1 expression, tumor mutation burden (TMB), and gene expression profile. Results: Between November 30, 2017 and April 8, 2020, 805 patients were randomized to tislelizumab (N=535) or docetaxel (N=270). The co‐primary endpoint of OS (ITT) was met at IA (data cut‐off August 10, 2020). At data cut‐off (July 15, 2021), FA was conducted in the PD‐L1 TC ≥25% population. Median follow‐up times (reverse Kaplan‐Meier method) were 30.9 months for tislelizumab and 27.5 months for docetaxel. In ITT population, tislelizumab continued to improve OS vs docetaxel (median OS 16.9 months vs 11.9 months, respectively; HR=0.66). In PD‐L1 TC ≥25% population, tislelizumab showed a statistically significant OS benefit vs docetaxel (median OS 19.3 months vs 11.5 months; HR=0.53; p<0.0001). A consistent OS benefit was observed for almost all pre‐defined subgroups. The study also met secondary endpoints at this FA. In the post hoc biomarker analysis, the association of TMB and genetic alterations including single target gene mutation or pathway mutations with clinical outcomes was further explored. Compared with TMB which was correlated with PFS benefit for tislelizumab vs docetaxel but was not correlated to OS benefit, except at the highest cutoff (≥14 mut/Mb), NOTCH1‐4 mutations showed association with better tislelizumab efficacy, which was correlated with both PFS and OS benefit (Table). No new safety signals were identified. Conclusions: Tislelizumab continued to improve OS versus docetaxel in pretreated advanced NSCLC regardless of PD‐L1 expression at final analysis. Biomarker analysis implied the potential association of NOTCH1‐4 mutations with greater tislelizumab efficacy for both OS and PFS.

abstract = {Background: In advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), high Programmed‐Death‐1 Ligand (PDL1) (>50%) expression demonstrate superior response and survival with immune checkpoint inhibitors compared to chemotherapy. We hypothesize that it is safe and feasible to substitute durvalumab instead of chemotherapy concurrently with radiotherapy (RT) in patients with Locally Advanced‐NSCLC (LA‐NSCLC) and high PD‐L1. Methods: NRG‐LU004 (NCT03801902) is a Phase I study for patients with stage II‐III unresectable or inoperable, LA‐NSCLC with PD‐L1> 50% (Dako 22C3 or Ventana SP263) expression. There were safety and expansion phases with a primary endpoint of safety. Patients started with 1500 mg durvalumab Q4 weeks and thoracic RT within 2 weeks from 1st infusion. Durvalumab continued once a month up to 1 year. In the safety cohort, 6 patients in cohort 1 were treated with accelerated fractionated RT (ACRT) to 60 Gy in 15 fractions, followed by a required safety hold for 90 days. During cohort 1 safety hold, cohort 2 patients were treated with conventional RT 60 Gy in 30 fractions (CONV) followed by a 60‐day safety hold. A cohort advanced to the expansion phase to enroll 6 more patients if safety criteria (0‐1 patients with a dose limiting toxicity [DLT]) were met. If both cohorts were deemed safe, patients would be randomized 1:1 to ACRT or CONV with safety defined as < 4 of 12 evaluable patients per arm experiencing a DLT. Feasibility was defined as at least 80% of patients in each arm receiving at least 80% of the planned dose of durvalumab during the first 8 weeks. Results: 24 evaluable patients enrolled between January 2019 and June 2021. No DLTs were reported in cohort 1, and 1 (unrelated bronchopulmonary hemorrhage leading to discontinuation of durvalumab) in cohort 2. Both safety cohorts advanced to the expansion phase. All but one patient (CONV) received RT per protocol/with an acceptable variation. At the time of analysis, 24% had received all 13 cycles of durvalumab. For the ACRT cohort, there were 4 grade 3, 1 grade 4 (lymphopenia), and 1 grade 5 AE (lung infection, assessed as unrelated to therapy). For CONV, there were 8 grade 3, 0 grade 4, and 1 grade 5 AE (respiratory failure, unrelated to therapy). For feasibility, 10 of 12 (85%) patients in the ACRT cohort received the second dose of durvalumab (2 not received due to shingles and unrelated death), while 9 of 12 (75%) of the CONV cohort received the second dose (reasons for not receiving: viral hepatitis, bronchopulmonary hemorrhage, and respiratory failure, all assessed as unrelated to therapy). Conclusions: Chemotherapy‐free thoracic RT approaches (ACRT or CONV RT) are safe, when given with concurrent durvalumab in patients with PD‐L1 high LA‐NSCLC. A trial to compare immunoradiotherapy and consolidation durvalumab to standard chemoradiation and consolidation durvalumab is planned.},

abstract = {Dose escalation with conventional fractionation and concurrent platin‐based chemotherapy within the RTOG 0617 trial has failed to show a survival benefit. Proton therapy has failed to show a reduction in radiation pneumonitis in comparison to intensity modulated photon radiotherapy at the same total dose according to the NCT 00915005 trial. Randomized trials for comparison of IMRT and 3D conformal radiotherapy are lacking. While randomized trials conducted so far failed to show an increment in survival by newer radiotherapy concepts on one hand, the old standard of giving 60 Gy with conventional fractionation and concurrent chemotherapy consolidated on the other. So where does the hope come from that technological advances in radiotherapy lead to an improved survival in locally advanced lung cancer, if not from randomized trials? It comes from many small precious components that can lead to an increase of loco‐regional control by radiotherapy in locally advanced NSCLC, the primary goal of radiotherapy. First of all, the determination of tumor spread has been substantially improved by the introduction of FDG‐PET/CT, by systematic mediastinal evaluation with EBUS‐TBNA, and by brain MRI. The determination of tumor position during irradiation has been improved by stereoscopic KV imaging during irradiation or real‐time magnetic resonance imaging and therefore tumor targeting can be optimized. Volumetric modulated arc therapy can deliver conformal dose distributions within a breath hold of 20 s. With hyperfractionated acceleration and concurrent chemotherapy, high biologically effective doses can be given for patients with locally advanced NSCLC resulting in similar survival and local control rates than with trimodality treatment. Integrated boost radiotherapy controlling dose gradients form gross tumor volume towards organs at risk as the contra‐lateral bronchial wall or the esophagus has become feasible and is tested within prospective trials. Immunotherapy and molecular targeted therapies are upcoming as combination partners with radiotherapy in selected tumors. Proper patient selection criteria resulted long term survival as high as 30‐45% in multicenter prospective trials in locally advanced NSCLC. These advantages have to be bundled into new radiotherapeutic concepts and tested against the standard of conventional fractionated radiotherapy up to 60 Gy and simultaneous chemotherapy in future well designed randomized trials.},

abstract = {In metastatic non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the role of radiotherapy (RT) has been limited to palliation to alleviate the symptoms. However, with the development of advanced RT techniques, recent advances in immuno‐oncology therapy targeting programmed death 1 (PD‐1) and programmed death ligand 1 (PD‐L1) and targeted agents for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) translocation allowed new roles of RT in these patients. Within this metastatic population, there is a subset of patients with a limited number of sites of metastatic disease, termed as oligometastasis that can achieve long‐term survival from aggressive local management. There is no consensus on the definition of oligometastasis; however, most clinical trials define oligometastasis as having 3 to 5 metastatic lesions. Recent phase II randomized clinical trials have shown that ablative RT, including stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) and hypofractionated RT, to primary and metastatic sites improved progression‐free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with oligometastatic NSCLC. The PEMBRO‐RT study, a randomized phase II study comparing SABR prior to pembrolizumab therapy and pembrolizumab therapy alone, revealed that the addition of SABR improved the overall response, PFS, and OS in patients with advanced NSCLC. The efficacy of RT in oligometastatic lung cancer has only been studied in phase II studies; therefore, large‐scale phase III studies are needed to confirm the benefit of local ablative RT in patients with oligometastatic NSCLC. Local intensified RT to primary and metastatic lesions is expected to become an important treatment paradigm in the near future in patients with metastatic lung cancer.},

abstract = {Stage III non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) comprises a highly heterogeneous group of patients defined according to the extent and localization of disease. Patients with discrete N2 involvement identified preoperatively with resectable disease are candidates for multimodal therapy either with definitive chemoradiation therapy, induction chemotherapy, or chemoradiotherapy (CTRT) followed by surgery. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has yielded comparable survival benefit to adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with stage II–III disease and may allow for downstaging the tumor or the lymph nodes, an earlier delivery of systemic treatment, and better compliance to systemic therapy. The use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) as induction therapy shows encouraging activity and a favorable safety profile in patients with resectable early stage or locally advanced NSCLC. An unprecedented rate of pathological response and downstaging has been reported in single‐arm clinical trials, especially when immunotherapy is combined with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Ongoing randomized phase II/III clinical trials assessing the efficacy and safety of induction with immunotherapy plus chemotherapy have the potential to establish this therapeutic approach as a novel standard of care. These trials aim to validate pathological response as a surrogate marker of survival benefit and to demonstrate that this therapeutic strategy can improve the cure rate in patients with stage II–III NSCLC.},

abstract = {Importance: Many patients with advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) receiving immunotherapy show primary resistance. High‐dose radiotherapy can lead to increased tumor antigen release, improved antigen presentation, and T‐cell infiltration. This radiotherapy may enhance the effects of checkpoint inhibition. Objective: To assess whether stereotactic body radiotherapy on a single tumor site preceding pembrolizumab treatment enhances tumor response in patients with metastatic NSCLC. Design, Setting, and Participants: Multicenter, randomized phase 2 study (PEMBRO‐RT) of 92 patients with advanced NSCLC enrolled between July 1, 2015, and March 31, 2018, regardless of programmed death‐ligand 1 (PD‐L1) status. Data analysis was of the intention‐to‐treat population. Interventions: Pembrolizumab (200 mg/kg every 3 weeks) either alone (control arm) or after radiotherapy (3 doses of 8 Gy) (experimental arm) to a single tumor site until confirmed radiographic progression, unacceptable toxic effects, investigator decision, patient withdrawal of consent, or a maximum of 24 months. Main Outcomes and Measures: Improvement in overall response rate (ORR) at 12 weeks from 20% in the control arm to 50% in the experimental arm with P <.10. Results: Of the 92 patients enrolled, 76 were randomized to the control arm (n = 40) or the experimental arm (n = 36). Of those, the median age was 62 years (range, 35‐78 years), and 44 (58%) were men. The ORR at 12 weeks was 18% in the control arm vs 36% in the experimental arm (P =.07). Median progression‐free survival was 1.9 months (95% CI, 1.7‐6.9 months) vs 6.6 months (95% CI, 4.0‐14.6 months) (hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.42‐1.18; P =.19), and median overall survival was 7.6 months (95% CI, 6.0‐13.9 months) vs 15.9 months (95% CI, 7.1 months to not reached) (hazard ratio, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.37‐1.18; P =.16). Subgroup analyses showed the largest benefit from the addition of radiotherapy in patients with PD‐L1‐negative tumors. No increase in treatment‐related toxic effects was observed in the experimental arm. Conclusions and Relevance: Stereotactic body radiotherapy prior to pembrolizumab was well tolerated. Although a doubling of ORR was observed, the results did not meet the study's prespecified end point criteria for meaningful clinical benefit. Positive results were largely influenced by the PD‐L1‐negative subgroup, which had significantly improved progression‐free survival and overall survival. These results suggest that a larger trial is necessary to determine whether radiotherapy may activate noninflamed NSCLC toward a more inflamed tumor microenvironment.

abstract = {Historically, treatment for non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has been stage‐dependent, with surgery typically considered the standard of care for stage I disease and a potential component of multi‐modality care for stages II‐III. By contrast, for stage IV disease, therapy aimed at prolongation of life has included systemic treatments, including chemotherapy, and, in recent years, targeted agents and immunotherapy. For metastatic disease, surgery has previously had a fairly limited role. However, oligometastatic disease may offer a potential opportunity for more aggressive local options. The distinct tumor biology and limited disease burden may be associated with improved outcomes.1 The landmark oligometastatic trial published by Gomez in 20162 aimed to assess the effect of local consolidative therapy (LCT) on progression‐free survival (PFS) of patients with 3 or fewer metastases who received standard first‐line chemotherapy, and patients were randomized to LCT vs maintenance treatment. LCT improved PFS and time to development of new metastatic lesions. Moreover, comprehensive LCT (cLCT) was also shown to improve overall survival (OS).3 A subsequent review from our institution of 194 patients, including those both on and off the oligometastatic clinical trial, aimed to identify those patients who would derive greatest benefit from LCT.4 This study revealed that cLCT was associated with improved OS, with median survival of 29 months for cLCT compared to 23 months for those with subcomprehensive LCT or no LCT. Moreover, lower intrathoracic stage, non‐squamous histology, and absence of bone metastases were all associated with improved OS after cLCT, theoretically identifying those patients most likely to benefit from aggressive local therapy—which can consist of surgery or radiation. In terms of surgery itself, we next aimed to evaluate the outcomes of operative pulmonary resection as LCT in oligometastatic disease,5 using radiotherapy as a benchmark comparator. Evaluating patients with 3 or fewer synchronous metastases and received LCT to all sites, we analyzed survival and progression. Surgery to the primary tumor was performed in 28% after a median of 3.7 months. 90‐day post‐treatment mortality after surgery was 0%, and, after a median follow‐up of 57 months, median OS after surgery was greater than 55 months. Median OS for radiation in this group was 23 months. Thus, it was concluded that surgery should remain a component of LCT for operable oligometastatic NSCLC patients, and it should be considered in randomized trial for patients with metastatic disease. While surgery has demonstrated survival benefits in the oligometastatic population, the potential complexity of these procedures cannot be overstated. In our institutional experience, thoracotomies have been required in more than 4/5 of operations, and adhesions and hilar fibrosis have been common. Events such as need for proximal pulmonary arterial control and unplanned changes in extent of operation are not infrequent, and the majority of cases have been reported as more difficult than usual. Thus, proper patient selection for surgery is imperative, as is preparation for the types of resources potentially needed for these cases. Despite surgical complexity, ability to achieve negative margins and to safely manage the patients perioperatively has been reassuring. Given the success of surgery as a component of LCT, surgery has become an important part of ongoing clinical trials evaluating LCT after novel agents for metastatic NSCLC. The LONESTAR trial6 aims to evaluate the benefits of LCT after immunotherapy, in that patients receive 12 weeeks of ipilumimab and nivolumab, after which those individuals with non‐progressive disease are randomized to LCT + continued immunotherapy vs continued immunotherapy alone. While radiation is required to at least one disease site, surgery to the primary site of disease is emphasized whenever possible. Similar to the LONESTAR trial, the NORTHSTAR trial is investigating the role of LCT after tyrosine‐kinase inhibitor therapy for patients with EGFR‐mutant metastatic NSCLC. Patients who have non‐progressive disease after 6‐12 weeks of osimertinib are randomized to LCT vs continued targeted therapy, again, offering surgery whenever feasible to the primary site of disease.7 More recently, the BRIGHTSTAR trial was initiated, evaluating the role of LCT after 8 weeks of brigatinib for patients with metastatic ALK‐mutated NSCLC, with the primary endpoints of safety and feasibility and secondary endpoints of PFS, OS, and time to progression.8 A number of patients have already undergone surgery on each of these trials, with promising perioperative outcomes. Despite the potential for innovation and expanded surgical indications, consideration must be given to the safety and potential technical challenges in such cases. We must consider issues related to fibrosis, adhesions, and sclerotic lymph nodes, as well as our limitations in identifying those patients with residual disease vs complete response. Surgery as LCT for oligometastatic NSCLC represents an exciting frontier for thoracic surgery, as a potential opportunity to help patients with advanced disease. Implications for training and resource allocation remain ever pertinent, and surgery needs to be considered as a potential therapeutic component in novel clinical trials in even advanced disease.

abstract = {Background: High grade pulmonary toxicity is a rare but possibly lifethreatening complication in patients with locally advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with chemoradiation (chemoRT) and immunotherapy (IO). Prior studies suggest that the percent of lung receiving 20 Gy (V20) is associated with the development of pneumonitis [1]. Objectives: We aimed to assess whether density changes within the region of lung receiving 20 Gy (ROL 20 Gy) on restaging imaging following definitive chemoRT were associated with subsequent development of grade ≥ 2 pulmonary toxicity. Methods: We assessed the time to grade ≥2 pulmonary adverse events (PAE; including pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or pneumonia) in 19 patients participating in a multi‐institution phase I clinical trial in which they received chemoRT to 60 Gy with concurrent ipilimumab followed by maintenance nivolumab. We calculated the relative change in mean Hounsfield Units (HU) within the ROL 20 Gy on the first restaging computed tomography (CT) scan of the thorax following chemoRT, compared to the baseline staging CT thorax, expressed as the percent change from baseline. Means were compared between groups with T‐tests. Time to event analyses were performed with Kaplan‐Meier models and log‐rank tests. Results: The median age was 66 years (range 39‐76). Six patients received cisplatin/etoposide, five received carboplatin/paclitaxel, and eight received cisplatin/pemetrexed. The median primary tumor diameter was 4.95cm (range 1.7‐9.1) and the median planning target volume (PTV) was 627.9cc (range 220.5‐1774.8). The median HU change in the ROL 20 Gy was 4.9% (range 18.4‐39.8). Highest grade PAE was grade 2 (n=3, 16%), grade 3 (n=5, 26%), and grade 5 (n=3, 16%). The median time to grade ≥ 2 PAE was 4.1 months (95% confidence interval 2.6‐not reached). Patients with grade ≥2 PAE had non‐significantly increased mean lung V20 (28% vs 21%, P=0.18), mean lung dose (16.5 Gy vs 13.0 Gy, P=0.35), and PTV volume (717 cc vs 539 cc, P =0.43) compared to those without grade ≥2 PAE. The mean relative HU change in the ROL 20 Gy was significantly higher for patients with grade ≥2 PAE compared to those without (13.9% vs ‐1.8%, P=0.048). Patients with ROL 20 Gy HU change ≥ 4.9% (≥cohort median value) had significantly shorter median time to grade ≥2 PAE compared to those with HU change <4.9% (3.3 months, 95% CI 1.7‐4.1 vs not reached, 95% CI 4.3‐not reached; P= 0.017) (Fig. 1). Conclusions: Patients with early increases in density within the region of lung receiving 20 Gy may be at increased risk for high grade pulmonary adverse events after definitive chemoRT and IO. We hypothesize such patients might be candidates for early mitigation strategies, such as early steroid intervention or delay of maintenance IO. Prospective study will be necessary to validate these findings.},

abstract = {Background: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of dynamic 18F‐FDG total body PET imaging as a predictive maker of induction chemo‐immunotherapy response in locally advanced non‐small cell lung cancer(NSCLC) by a prospective study. Methods: Stage IIIA‐IIIC NSCLC patients were prospectively enrolled in a prospective total body PETCT study ( NCT04654234, GASTO‐1067) and a randomized phase II clinical trial ( NCT04085250) between September 2020 and December 2020. All patients underwent a dynamic total‐body 18F‐FDG PET/CT scan before any treatment and after 2 cycles of induction chemo‐immunotherapy (docetaxel+cisplatin+nivolumab). The primary lung tumor, metastatic regional lymph node and inflammatory lymph node before and after treatment were manually delineated by a nuclear medicine physician and a radiation oncologist. Total Body PET was acquired between 0 ‐ 60 mins after the injection of FDG from the subject's feet. Patients was separated into high dynamic FDG metabolic (H‐DFM) group and low DFM(L‐DFM) group by the scatter plot of SUV‐mean and Ki‐mean of primary lung tumor. We compared lesion heterogeneity and different image‐derived PET metrics including the metabolic tumor volume(MTV), SUV total lesion glycolysis(SUVTLG), Patlak‐derived influx rate constant (Ki) TLG (Ki‐TLG). Results: Fifteen patients were analyzed, 8 patients was in H‐DFM group and 7 in L‐DFM group. Patients in H‐DFM group had significant decreased levels of MTV(p < 0.001), SUV‐TLG(p < 0.001) and Ki‐TLG(p < 0.001) both in primary lung tumor and metastatic lymph node by the induction chemo‐immuotherapy. However, patients in L‐DFM group only had a significant reduction of MTV in primary lung tumor(p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the MTV of metastatic lymph node(p > 0.5), the SUV‐TLG(p > 0.5) and Ki‐TLG(p > 0.5) of primary lung tumor and metastatic lymph node, before and after induction chemoradiotherapy. Conclusions: Patients in H‐DFM group had the better treatment response of induction chemo‐immunotherapy with significant decreased levels of MTV, SUV‐TLG and Ki‐TLG. Dynamic 18F‐FDG Total body PET Imaging could be regard as a potential predictive marker of induction chemoimmunotherapy response in the setting of LANSCLC.},

In case a second line treatment is indicated, the drug to be used is docetaxel. Patients randomised to racotumomab group will be vaccinated until any causes of permanent discontinuation are met: unacceptable toxicity, intercurrent disease or other reactions that might in the investigator's opinion constitute an exclusion criteria and/or permanently prevent administration for more than 8 weeks, deterioration of the performance status (PS) greater than 3, patient request and/or failure to comply with treatment during 8 or more weeks. The vaccine is administered intradermically in 4 subdoses at selected sites: deltoid region, anterior forearms, anterior thighs and posterior calf. The first 5 doses are administered at 14 day intervals and the remaining doses at 28 day intervals. If for any reason the vaccine is discontinued the patient will continue with follow up visits (every 2 months) for evaluation of survival just as the patients in the best support treatment arm do. Tumour evaluations will be performed every 8 weeks. For racotumomab arm only blood sampling for immunological tests will be obtained at baseline for both groups and at month 2, 4, 8 and 12 and every 4 months onwards. For both treatment arms sampling for determination of suppressor cells (T reg) will be performed at baseline, month 2, 4, 8, 12 and every 4 months onwards, at disease progression and upon completion of second line therapy.

abstract = {Case‐Based Management of Brain Metastasis (Bm) in Advanced Lung Cancer Patients: Changing the Standards. Questions to Be Addressed M. Guckenberger, E.F. Smit Dept. of Radiation Oncology, USZ, Switserland, Dept. of Thoracic Oncology, NCI, The Netherlands. Brain metastases develop in relevant numbers of patients through their courses of metastatic non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and are associated with worsening of quality‐of‐live and survival. Traditionally, outcome was very poor due to the lack of effective treatment options, for the brain metastases but also for extracranial metastatic disease. Recent advances in imaging, local and systemic treatment options have changed the prognosis of patients with NSCLC brain metastases and have challenged traditional treatment strategies. Management of patients with brain metastases today needs a more individualized approach due to the multiple factors influencing the decision‐making process: patient performance status; number, location and size of brain metastases; presence of symptoms and neurological deficits; presence and extend of extracranial disease; histology and presence of activating driver mutations; available systematic treatment options and their CNS activity; patient preference. From a local treatment perspective, radiosurgery and neurosurgical resection are treatment options, which have shown to improve survival in patients with limited brain metastases. Whole brain radiotherapy is not recommended after radiosurgery and neurosurgical resection; however stereotactic radiotherapy should be added to the resection cavity to improve local metastasis control. The value of radiosurgery without whole brain irradiation for multiple brain metastases is currently under investigation. Whole brain irradiation is today still recommended for patients with multiple and in particular symptomatic brain metastases; whether hippocampal avoidance can reduce the risk of damage to the neurocognitive system is not finally answered. The landscape is currently changing rapidly and fundamentally due to identification of activating driver mutations and the existence of effective targeted drugs. Additionally, treatment with immune checkpoint inhibition has also shown intracranial activity. Consequently, there is in particular a need to identify optimal combined modality strategies of local radiotherapy and systemic targeted drugs and immunotherapy. From a systemic treatment perspective, it has become apparent that brain metastases may also be sensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibitors against a variety of targets and emerging data suggest that immune checkpoint inhibitors display activity as well. Therefore, in case of asymptomatic brain metastases at diagnosis when the primary lung cancer is characterized by an oncogenic driver, nowadays many would favour initial treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors in an effort to delay radiotherapy to the brain as long as possible. Whether symptomatic brain metastases at diagnosis may be managed in a similar manner, especially when refractory to high dose steroids, is less clear. The third generation EGFR TKI (osimertinib) and second/third generation Alk inhibitors (ceritinib, alectinib, brigatinib and lorlatinib) are associated with response rates in the brain in the relapse setting on treatment of first/second generation EGFR TKi’s or first generation Alk inhibitor that are not different from extracranial response rates. Thus, also in this clinical situation, systemic treatment plays an important role in delaying radiotherapy – in particular whole brain radiotherapy‐ as long as possible. It should be noted however, that there are no formal randomized comparisons available of these treatment modalities. Keywords: NSCLC, brain metastases},

abstract = {Radiation techniques for lung cancer have evolved substantially over the past decade. While previously many patients were treated with 3D conformal therapy, with large uniform margins placed to estimate respiratory motion in the 'average' tumor, patients are now simulated with sophisticated, real‐time monitoring of internal motion such that treatment volumes can be individualized to maximize normal tissue sparing through image‐guided radiation therapy (IGRT). In addition, many patients are now treated with intensity‐modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), which has served to drastically improve conformality in select cases and increase the proportion of patients in which high doses are achievable. Concurrent with these advances, proton beam therapy (PBT) has been implemented in a limited number of centers, with the hope of utilizing the dosimetric distribution advantage of the Bragg Peak to further reduce toxicity. The role of PBT in both early‐stage and locally advanced non‐small cell lung cancer continues to be defined, as results from a phase II multicenter randomized trial predominantly in patients with stage II‐III disease did not demonstrate superiority with PBT and concurrent chemotherapy when compared to similar regimens with IMRT. Finally, there have been much data produced with regard to dosing regimens. In early‐stage disease, there has been increased implementation of stereotactic ablative body radiation (SABR), with prospective data emerging for both peripheral and central lesions. In the locally advanced setting, results from RTOG 0617 demonstrated no difference when comparing 60 Gy vs. 74 Gy in the setting of chemoradiation. There has also been a trend towards hypofractionation for patients who are unable to tolerate concurrent chemoradiation or those with oligometastatic disease, yet the benefit of hypofractionated radiation sequentially vs. combined modality treatment will need to be further assessed in prospective randomized trials, particularly in the era of immunotherapy.},

abstract = {Purpose/Objective(s): Outcomes remain poor for unresectable LA‐NSCLC treated with concurrent chemoradiation followed by immunotherapy. The primary tumor is the most common site of non‐metastatic failure, and local failure (LF) is associated with overall survival (OS). While local control (LC) and OS have improved by increasing the biological effective dose with SBRT in early‐stage NSCLC, SBRT use in LA‐NSCLC has largely been limited to primary tumor boost after chemoradiation, which has high morbidity. A recent phase II trial of SBRT to the primary tumor and chemoradiation to involved lymph nodes demonstrated lower rates of pulmonary and cardiac toxicities relative to historical controls, while improving LC, progression‐free survival (PFS), and OS. We hypothesize that replacing conventionally fractionated radiotherapy with SBRT to the primary tumor followed by concurrent chemoradiation to the mediastinum will be associated with lower rates of toxicity and improved QOL, while also improving LC, PFS, and OS. Materials/Methods: LU008 is a phase III randomized trial in stage II‐III NSCLC conducted by NRG Oncology (NCT05624996). Inclusion criteria include node‐positive stage II‐III NSCLC, medically inoperable or surgery declined, identified primary tumor ≤7 cm, ECOG performance status (PS) 0‐2, and ≤4 cycles of systemic therapy prior to registration. Key exclusion includes central primary tumor location that is <2cm from involved nodal disease. Patients are randomized to chemoradiation to all disease (60/2 Gy) (control arm) or SBRT to the primary (BED ≥100 Gy in 3‐5 fractions) followed by chemoradiation to nodal disease (60/2 Gy) (experimental arm). Standard concurrent chemotherapy regimens are allowed in both arms. Maintenance therapy is pragmatic, with most patients expected to receive durvalumab for up to 12 months. The primary objectives are to compare OS and PFS. Secondary objectives are to compare response rate, LC, patterns of failure, pulmonary function changes, QOL, and toxicity. Exploratory objectives include biospecimen analyses, regional lung ventilation, and proton vs. photon differences. Real‐time pre‐treatment reviews are conducted. Results: LU008 was activated nationally on 5/10/23. As of 3/1/24, 30 patients have been accrued, and 266 sites have the trial open to accrual. Final target accrual is 474 subjects, with an expected 9.5 accruals per month after a 6‐month ramp up. Conclusion: LU008 is a thoracic NCI National Clinical Trial Network (NCTN) trial with highly pragmatic eligibility criteria, with no lab/PFT cutoffs, no CT chest/MRI brain/lab time windows, no exclusions for actionable mutations, and allowing ECOG PS 2. LU008 is the only phase III NCTN trial accruing for inoperable LA‐NSCLC and may change the standard of care in inoperable LA‐NSCLC by improving LC, PFS, and OS.

Targeted therapy is the most essential therapeutic option for NSCLC, other common treatments include radiation therapy, surgery, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy. OBJECTIVE: Our study objective was to estimate whether progression‐free survival (PFS) is an outcome of NSCLC extracted from 18 randomized control trials (RCTs) with docetaxel as experimental group and antineoplastic agent, kinase inhibitor, and monoclonal antibodies as a control group. METHODS: We selected relevant studies published between 2011 and 2022 using Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, and Cochrane Library. Advanced NSCLC, chemotherapy, RCT, docetaxel, and second‐line treatment were the terms included in the search. A total of 9738 patients were evaluated from the 18 identified studies. We used the meta package of R Studio to perform the meta‐analysis. Graphical funnel plots were used to evaluate publication bias visually. RESULTS: Patients who underwent docetaxel‐based therapy had a considerably longer PFS than those who got antineoplastic agents, kinase inhibitors, or monoclonal antibodies‐based treatment. Patients in the standard treatment arm had a slightly longer PFS than those in the experimental therapy arm in the overall meta‐analysis. CONCLUSION: Docetaxel outperformed monoclonal antibodies, antineoplastic agents, and kinase inhibitors in the second‐line therapy of advanced NSCLC since PFS was extensively utilized.},

abstract = {Background: Atezo, an anti‐PD‐L1 mAb, prevents the binding of PD‐L1 to PD‐1 and B7.1 and restores antitumor immune response. Single‐agent atezo has promising efficacy and tolerability in pts with previously treated advanced NSCLC, with a survival benefit observed across PD‐L1 expression levels. Given the need to improve survival of pts with early‐stage NSCLC, IMpower010 (NCT02486718) has been initiated. This global Phase III, randomized, open‐label trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of atezo vs BSC, following adjuvant cisplatin (cis)‐based chemo in pts with resected stage IB (tumors ≥ 4 cm)‐IIIA NSCLC. Trial design: Eligibility criteria include complete tumor resection 4‐12 weeks prior to enrollment for pathologic stage IB (tumors ≥ 4 cm)‐IIIA NSCLC. Pts must have adequately recovered from surgery, be eligible to receive cis‐based adjuvant chemo and have an ECOG PS 0‐1. Exclusion criteria include the presence of other malignancies, use of hormonal cancer or radiation therapy within 5 years, prior chemo, exposure to prior immunotherapy and autoimmune disease. Approximately 1127 pts will be enrolled regardless of PD‐L1 expression status. Suitable pts will receive up to four 21‐d cycles of cis‐based chemo (cis [75 mg/m2 IV, d 1]+ either vinorelbine [30 mg/m2 IV, d 1, 8], docetaxel [75 mg/m2 IV, d 1] or gemcitabine [1250 mg/m2 IV, d 1, 8], or pemetrexed [500 mg/m2 IV, d 1; nonsquamous NSCLC only]). Adjuvant radiation therapy is not permitted. After adjuvant treatment, eligible pts will be randomized 1:1 to receive atezo 1200 mg q3w, 16 cycles or BSC. Stratification factors include sex, histology (squamous vs nonsquamous), extent of disease (stage IB vs II vs IIIA) and PD‐L1 expression by IHC (tumor cell [TC]; tumor‐infiltrating immune cell [IC]; TC2/3 [≥ 5% expressing PD‐L1] and any IC vs TC0/1 [< 5%] and IC2/3 vs TC0/1 and IC0/1 [<5%]). The primary endpoint is disease‐free survival; secondary endpoints include OS and safety. Exploratory endpoints include PD‐L1 status, immune‐and tumor‐related biomarkers before, during and after treatment with atezo and at radiographic disease recurrence, or confirmation of new primary NSCLC.},

abstract = {Introduction: Avelumab is an anti‐PD‐L1 antibody that has shown antitumor activity and an acceptable safety profile in patients with non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We report results from the phase 3 JAVELIN Lung 100 trial, which compared first‐line (1L) avelumab monotherapy (2 dose schedules) vs platinum‐based doublet chemotherapy in patients with previously untreated PD‐L1+ advanced NSCLC. Methods: JAVELIN Lung 100 (NCT02576574) was an open‐label, multicenter, phase 3 trial that enrolled adult patients with previously untreated metastatic or recurrent stage IV PD‐L1+ (PD‐L1 expression on ≥1% of tumor cells determined by Dako PD‐L1 IHC 73‐10 pharmDx) and EGFR/ALK‐wild‐type NSCLC. Patients were initially randomized 1:1 to receive avelumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W) or platinum‐based doublet chemotherapy every 3 weeks (Q3W) intravenously, stratified by histology. Following a protocol amendment based on pharmacokinetics/exposure analyses, patients were randomized 1:2:2 to receive avelumab 10 mg/kg Q2W, platinum‐based doublet chemotherapy Q3W, or avelumab 10 mg/kg weekly (QW) for 12 weeks and Q2W thereafter, stratified by histology and PD‐L1 expression cutoffs (high, ≥80%; moderate, ≥50%; and any, ≥1% of tumor cells). Primary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and progression‐free survival (PFS) per independent review committee (IRC) in patients with high‐expression PD‐L1+ tumors (≥80% of tumor cells). Results: 1,214 patients with PD‐L1+ tumors (≥1% of tumor cells) were randomized to the avelumab Q2W (n=366), chemotherapy (n=526), or avelumab QW (n=322) arms. At data cutoff (October 2021), median follow‐up was >41 months in all arms. No statistically significant difference in OS or PFS was observed between each of the avelumab arms and the chemotherapy arm (Table). Among patients with high‐expression PD‐L1+ tumors, 5.3% and 20.2 % of patients in the avelumab Q2W and QW arms vs 30.6% of patients in the chemotherapy arm received poststudy anti‐PD‐(L)1 treatment. Among all treated patients in the avelumab Q2W, avelumab QW, and chemotherapy arms, treatment‐emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurred in 95.8%, 96.9%, and 96.8%, including grade ≥3 TEAEs in 60.1%, 56.9%, and 64.8%, respectively. Conclusions: JAVELIN Lung 100 did not meet its primary objective of demonstrating superior OS or PFS by IRC with 1L avelumab (Q2W or QW) vs platinum‐based doublet chemotherapy in patients with high‐expression PD‐L1+ tumors. The safety profile of avelumab was consistent with that observed in previous studies of avelumab monotherapy. [Formula presented] Keywords: avelumab, NSCLC, first–line},

abstract = {Background: Platinum‐based concurrent chemoradiation(CRT) followed by one year of the human immunoglobulin G1 kappa (IgG1κ) monoclonal antibody, durvalumab, which blocks the interaction of PD‐L1 with its receptors PD‐1 and CD80, is the standard of care for locally advanced, unresectable non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Early studies have noted the feasibility of concomitant administration of radiotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibition in NSCLC. EA5181 will evaluate the use of concomitant durvalumab with chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced NSCLC. Methods: EA5181 is a randomized, multi‐center, phase III study for patients with unresectable Stage III NSCLC comparing the efficacy of CRT with concomitant durvalumab to CRT, followed by one year of durvalumab. Eligibility criteria include: an ECOG PS of 0‐1, adequate pulmonary function (FEV1 and DLCO both > 40%), no history of auto‐immune disease and no past chemotherapy or RT for this lung cancer. Stratification factors include age, sex, stage, and planned concurrent chemotherapy type. Eligible patients with be randomized 1:1 to receive 60Gy RT (2Gy fractions) CRT and durvalumab (Arm A) or 60Gy CRT (Arm B). Investigators will be allowed to choose from three different chemotherapy options: cisplatin/etoposide q 28 days, Pemetrexed/cisplatin q 21 days, and weekly paclitaxel/Carboplatin. Arm A will use 750mg fixed of durvalumab (considered equivalent to 10mg/kg) on days 1, 11, and 21 of RT. Assuming no disease progression, patients in both arms will be followed by monthly (q28 days) fixed dose of 1500mg durvalumab for one year which will be given optimally within 14 days of radiation or when (non)hematologic toxicity is < Grade 2. The primary endpoint is overall survival. Secondary endpoints include progression‐free survival, incidence of local/distant progression and toxicity. The target sample size is 660 patients, anticipated to recruit over 55 months, with follow up for an additional 42 months. This provides approximately 82% power if the true hazard ratio for overall survival was 0.75 or less, with 2‐ sided alpha of 0.05, and assuming a median survival of 42.5 months in the control arm. The study was activated on 04/09/20 and has currently accrued 90 patients on 02/03/21.},

abstract = {Background: Gangliosides are an attractive target for immunotherapy in cancer since they are not expressed in normal human tissue, are overexpressed in several solid tumors, including NSCLC, and have been implicated in tumor development and progression. Racotumomab is an antiidiotype murine monoclonal antibody specific to P3 Ab1 MAb, an antibody that reacts with NeuGc‐containing gangliosides, sulfatides and other antigens expressed in tumors. Phase I trials conducted in advanced melanoma, breast and lung cancer have demonstrated the low toxicity and high immunogenicity of Racotumomab. Methods: A phase II multicenter, controlled, randomized, double blind trial is ongoing to evaluate the effect of Racotumomab in Overall Survival (OS) in patients with advanced (IIIB and IV) NSCLC who have completed onco‐specific treatment as per the Oncology Therapeutic Guidelines (surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy according to initial staging) and have achieved partial, complete response or disease stabilization. ECOG status was < 2 and life expectancy ≥ 4 months. Vaccination began 4‐8 weeks after the end of the onco‐specific treatment. Prior chemotherapy in most cases was cisplatin/ vinblastin (4 ‐ 6 cycles). Patients were randomized (1:1) to control group (placebo) or vaccine (Racotumomab). Vaccination consisted in 5 doses, 1 every 14 days (induction period), followed by a maintenance period (1 dose every 28 days) until patient refusal or worsening of ECOG status. Results: Safety: The most common adverse events were mild and moderate reactions at the injection site (pain, erythema, induration) and “flu‐like” symptoms, none unexpected. No differences were observed between both groups. Overall Survival: Intent to Treat Analysis (ITT): Data presented corresponds to 132/176 patients (75% of the sample), who had been followed for ≥ 8 months. Median OS is 8.23 months in Arm B and 6.17 months in Arm A (log rank test, p= 0.036). Long‐ term OS rate (%) at 24 months: 19.4% in Arm B and 7.7% in Arm A. Per Protocol Population Analysis (PPP): Shown data only include patients who have received ≥ 5 doses of vaccine (92/132 patients, 70% of the patients in the database). Median OS was 10.97 months in Arm B and 6.27 months in Arm A (log rank test, p= 0.0115). Long‐ term OS rate (%) at 24 months: 24% in Arm B and 6.2 % Arm A. Conclusion: • Immunization with Racotumomab is safe. • There is an OS benefit for Arm B, both in ITT and PPP analyses. • Additional data about this trial will be presented at the IASLC meeting.},

abstract = {Introduction: TIM‐3 and PD‐1 are markers of T‐cell exhaustion co‐expressed on tumor‐infiltrating T cells (CD4+, CD8+) and antigen presenting cells in lung cancer. TIM‐3 expression has also been associated with poor overall survival (OS) outcomes in NSCLC. In the Phase 1 AMBER study (NCT02817633), cobolimab (GSK4069889, a TIM‐3 inhibitor) plus dostarlimab (a PD‐1 inhibitor) showed clinical responses with an acceptable safety profile in patients with heavily pretreated, PD‐1/PD‐L1 relapsed/refractory, advanced or metastatic NSCLC. COSTAR Lung (NCT04655976) aims to compare the efficacy and safety of cobolimab plus dostarlimab and standard of care chemotherapy (CT, docetaxel; Arm A) to dostarlimab plus docetaxel (Arm B) to docetaxel alone (Arm C) in patients with PD‐1/PD‐L1 relapsed/refractory NSCLC. Methods: This is an ongoing global, multicenter, parallel‐group treatment, randomized, Phase 2, open‐label, 3‐arm study, with the potential for a Phase 3 expansion. Eligible patients will be ≥18 years old, with pathologically confirmed advanced/metastatic NSCLC (squamous or non‐squamous) who have received ≤2 prior lines of therapy that include an anti‐PD‐1/PD‐L1 therapy plus platinum‐based CT only. Additional inclusion criteria are documented radiological disease progression on prior therapy, confirmed PD‐L1 status, absence of sensitizing EGFR, ALK, or ROS‐1 mutations, and ECOG PS 0‐1. Patients will be randomized 2:2:1 to Arm A, Arm B, or Arm C. Patients will receive cobolimab (300 mg IV), dostarlimab (500 mg IV), and/or docetaxel (75 mg/m2 IV) Q3W. Cobolimab and dostarlimab treatment will continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, patient withdrawal, investigator’s decision, or death. Docetaxel treatment will continue for ≥4 cycles or until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. The primary endpoint is OS for Arms A or B vs C. Secondary endpoints include OS for Arm A vs B and investigator‐assessed confirmed objective response rate (ORR); progression‐free survival (PFS) and duration of response (RECIST v1.1); quality of life assessments; safety; and tolerability. Exploratory endpoints include investigator‐assessed confirmed ORR and PFS (iRECIST), pharmacokinetics, biomarkers of response, and patient‐reported efficacy and tolerability. Approximately 250 patients will be randomized to the Phase 2 portion with an interim analysis planned after at least 18 weeks of follow‐up. An additional 500 patients (n=200 each in Arms A‐B and n=100 in Arm C) may be included in the Phase 3 portion. Funding: GSK (213410).

abstract = {Background: High dose radiation can lead to increased tumor antigen release, improved antigen presentation and T‐cell infiltration. It may therefore enhance the effects of checkpoint inhibition. We evaluated if stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) on a single metastasis preceding pembrolizumab treatment in patients with NSCLC is well tolerated and leads to an increased tumor response. Methods: Patients (n = 74) with advanced NSCLC (≥2 line) regardless of PD‐L1 status were randomized (1:1) between pembrolizumab (200mg q3w) alone (control arm) or pembrolizumab preceded by SBRT (3x8Gy within 7 days prior to the first cycle) on a single metastasis (experimental arm). Sequential biopsies were obtained from the same, non‐irradiated tumor site at baseline and after two cycles of pembrolizumab. The primary endpoint was improvement in overall response rate (ORR) at 12 weeks from 20% in the control arm to 50% in the experimental arm according to RECIST 1.1. Results: From July 2015 until the time of writing, 72 patients had been randomized and 64 patients who received at least one cycle of pembrolizumab could be evaluated for the primary endpoint. ORR at 12 weeks was 19% in the control arm (n = 32) vs 41% in the experimental arm (n = 32); the number of patients with a CR, PR, SD and PD were 0/6/7/19 and 1/12/6/13, respectively. Median PFS was 1.8 months in the control arm vs 6.4 months in the experimental arm; HR 0.55 (CI 0.31 ‐ 0.98, p = 0.04). Grade ≥3 toxicity was experienced in 22% of patients in the control arm vs 17% in the experimental arm. The most common AEs were fatigue, nausea, fever and hypothyroidism. No increase in treatment related toxicity was observed in the experimental arm. Conclusions: With 86% of patients evaluable, we conclude that pembrolizumab preceded by SBRT resulted in a doubling of the ORR without increase in toxicity. The primary endpoint of 50% DCR was not (yet) met. This is a well‐tolerated and promising treatment strategy to augment the antitumor immune response with checkpoint blockade. Definitive results as well as correlations with PD‐L1 expression will be available and discussed at ASCO.},

abstract = {Background: Radiotherapy (RT) can be used to reduce symptoms and maintain open airways for patients with non‐small cell lung cancer when systemic treatment is not sufficient. For some patients, tumor control is not achieved due to radioresistance. Concurrent inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptors has been proposed as a strategy to overcome radioresistance but may increase toxicity. We performed a randomized trial to assess the efficacy, tolerance, and quality of life of concurrent erlotinib and palliative thoracic RT for patients with advanced non‐small cell lung cancer. Methods: Patients were randomized 1:1 to RT alone (arm A) or in combination with erlotinib (arm B). A computed tomography (CT) scan at baseline and one at 4–12 weeks after inclusion was used to evaluate treatment response. Adverse events were registered during treatment and the subsequent 30 days. Health‐related quality‐of‐life questionnaires were completed by the patients at baseline, weeks 2, 6, and 20. Results: A total of 114 patients were included. Of the 74 patients with CT scans available for evaluation of treatment effect, there were no significant differences in tumor size reduction between the two groups: median 14.5% reduction in the control arm A and 17.0% in the erlotinib arm B (p = 0.68). Overall survival was not significantly different between the two treatment arms: 7.0 and 7.8 months in arm A and arm B, respectively (log‐rank p = 0.32). There was no significant increase in adverse events in the experimental arm, other than what is expected from erlotinib treatment alone. Overall, patients reported similar quality of life in both treatment arms. Conclusion: Concurrent erlotinib and palliative thoracic RT for patients with advanced non‐small cell lung cancer was well tolerated but did not improve the efficacy of the RT.

abstract = {Background: The standard of care for patients with unresectable stage III non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is platinum‐based chemotherapy with concurrent radiotherapy, followed by durvalumab consolidation for 12 months. When administered after completion of concurrent chemoradiotherapy (cCRT) in patients with unresectable NSCLC in the PACIFIC study, durvalumab demonstrated superior clinical outcomes vs placebo in terms of progression‐free survival (PFS; hazard ratio [HR] 0.51; 95% CI: 0.41, 0.63) and overall survival (OS; HR 0.68; 99.73% CI 0.47, 0.997; p=0.0025).1 Comparing durvalumab with placebo, the 24‐month OS rate (95% CI) was 66.3% (61.7, 70.4) vs 55.6% (48.9, 61.8), median PFS was 17.2 months (13.1, 23.9) vs 5.6 months (4.6, 7.7) and objective response rate was 30.0% (25.8, 34.5) vs 17.8% (13.0, 23.6).1,2 However, despite cCRT followed by durvalumab, most patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC relapse and eventually die from NSCLC. The COAST study (NCT03822351) is a platform trial that aims to identify potential combinations of durvalumab with novel agents to improve response rates over monotherapy. Method: This multidrug, randomized, phase 2 trial is evaluating the clinical activity and safety of durvalumab alone or in combination with the novel agents oleclumab (MEDI9447) and monalizumab (IPH2201) in patients with unresectable, stage III NSCLC who have not progressed following definitive cCRT. New treatment arms evaluating other durvalumab combinations may be added based on emerging preclinical and clinical data. The primary endpoint is objective response per RECIST v1.1 with monotherapy and combination therapy. Secondary endpoints include safety, efficacy (duration of response, disease control, PFS, 12‐month PFS rate, OS), pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity. The COAST study is open for accrual with an estimated total target enrollment of up to 60 patients per treatment arm. References 1Antonia SJ, et al. N Engl J Med 2018;379:2342–50. 2Antonia SJ, et al.

abstract = {INTERVENTION: Intervention1: Tislelizumab: Tislelizumab is a humanized immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) variant monoclonal antibody that binds to the T‐cell surface receptor programmed cell death protein 1 (PD‐1), prevents interaction of PD‐1 with its ligands PD‐L1 and PD‐L2, and blocks PD‐1‐mediated inhibitory signaling. As a result, tislelizumab can activate T‐cells to mount immune responses for eradication of cancer and viral infection in humans. The target modulation function may be quantitatively assessed by binding ELISA, binding analysis by fluorescence activated sorting, competitive binding analysis against PD‐L1 and PD‐L2 by fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACs), and P3Z assay by reverse signal transduction by interleukin‐2 secretion. Dose and frequency: Tislelizumab 200 mg will be administered on Day 1 of each 21 day cycle (once every 3 weeks). Route of administration: Tislelizumab will be administered by intravenous administration through an intravenous line. Control Intervention1: Carboplatin: Carboplatin is one of the platinum‐based anti‐cancer drugs and its parent compound is cisplatin. Carboplatin undergoes activation inside cells and forms reactive platinum complexes that cause the intra‐ and inter‐strand cross‐linkage of DNA molecules within the cell. This modifies the DNA structure and inhibits DNA synthesis. This may affect a cell in all the phases of its cycle. Dose, Frequency and Route of Administration: Carboplatin AUC 6 mg/ml/min will be administered intravenous administration on Day 1 of each cycle for 4 to 6 cycles in the induction phase of the treatment. Control Intervention2: Paclitaxel: Paclitaxel is a type of chemotherapy called a taxane.

abstract = {Background: First‐line (1L) standard of care for patients with HER2 mutation‐positive (HER2m+) nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is platinum‐based chemotherapy ± immunotherapy. To date, no targeted 1L treatments have been approved. Zongertinib is a HER2‐selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor that binds to wild‐type and mutated HER2, and spares EGFR. In Phase Ia of Beamion LUNG‐1 (NCT04886804), zongertinib conferred objective response/disease control rates of 49/91% in patients with pretreated HER2 aberration‐positive solid tumors, and 58/97% in those patients with HERm+ NSCLC, with manageable safety with few EGFR‐associated adverse events. Purpose: Here we describe Beamion LUNG‐2 (NCT06151574), a phase 3, randomized, controlled, open‐label trial that will compare the efficacy and safety of 1L zongertinib with standard of care in patients with HER2m+, locally advanced/metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC. Experimental design: Approximately 270 patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive either zongertinib or standard of care. Key inclusion criteria: histologically/cytologically diagnosed advanced/metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC; no prior systemic treatment for locally advanced/metastatic disease; HER2 mutation in the tyrosine kinase domain; ≥1 measurable lesion (RECIST 1.1). Key exclusion criteria: tumors that have alterations with available therapy, and radiotherapy/major surgery ≤4 weeks prior to randomization. In the experimental arm, oral zongertinib 120 mg once daily will be given in 21‐day cycles. In the comparator arm, intravenous pemetrexed 500 mg/m 2 chemotherapy plus either cisplatin 75 mg/m2 or carboplatin area under the curve 5, plus pembrolizumab 200 mg will be given on day 1 every 3 weeks for 4 cycles, followed by pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 plus pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks for ≤35 cycles. In both arms, treatment will continue until progressive disease (RECIST 1.1), undue toxicity, or other criteria are met. Primary endpoint: progression‐free survival (RECIST 1.1). Secondary endpoints: overall response (defined as best overall response of complete or partial response, RECIST 1.1), patient‐reported outcomes (changes from baseline to Week 25), overall survival, and adverse events during the on‐treatment period (CTCAE 5.0).},

abstract = {Background: The standard of care for unresectable, locally advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (LA‐NSCLC) is chemoradiotherapy (CRT) followed by durvalumab, based on the PACIFIC trial. Disease progression and pneumonitis were reported as the main reasons to preclude the initiation of durvalumab in multiple retrospective studies. However, the transition rate and the reasons for failure to proceed to consolidation therapy with durvalumab after CRT were not evaluated prospectively. Although phase II studies in Japan have shown high efficacy and tolerability of CRT with cisplatin + S‐1 (SP), no prospective study using durvalumab after SP‐based CRT has yet been reported. We therefore conducted a phase II study to verify the efficacy and safety of durvalumab following SP‐based CRT. In this interim analysis, we report the transition rate and the reasons for its failure. Methods: In treatment‐naïve LA‐NSCLC, cisplatin (60 mg/m2, day 1) and S‐1 (80–120 mg/body, days 1–14) were administered with two 4‐week cycles with concurrent thoracic radiotherapy (60 Gy) followed by durvalumab every 2 weeks for up to 12 months. The primary endpoint was 12 month progression‐free survival rate. Results: Fifty‐nine patients were enrolled, of whom 86.4% (51/59) proceeded to durvalumab. All of them initiated durvalumab within 42 days after CRT [median 18 days (range: 3–38)], including 27.5% (14/51) in <14 days. Common reasons for failure to proceed to durvalumab were disease progression (2/59, 3.4%) and adverse events (6/59, 10.2%). Among the latter cases, four resumed treatment and proceeded to durvalumab within 42 days on off‐protocol. The objective response rate and the disease control rate were 62.7% and 93.2%, respectively. The incidences of ⩾grade 3 pneumonitis, febrile neutropenia, and esophagitis were 0%, 8.5%, and 3.4%, respectively. Conclusion: Regarding durvalumab after CRT, this interim analysis of the SAMURAI study clarified the high transition rate, early introduction, and reasons for failure to proceed to consolidation therapy, which were not determined in the PACIFIC trial.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) is a novel, non‐invasive, anti‐mitotic treatment modality, based on low intensity alternating electric fields. TTFields predominantly affect two phases of mitosis: metaphase ‐ by disrupting the formation of the mitotic spindle, and cytokinesis ‐ by dielectrophoretic dislocation of intracellular constituents. TTFields were shown to significantly extend the survival of newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients when combined with temozolomide. Efficacy of TTFields in non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) of all histologies has been demonstrated in multiple in vitro and in vivo models as well as in a phase I/II pilot study in combination with pemetrexed, where overall survival was extended by more than five months compared to historical controls. LUNAR TRIAL DESIGN: The hypothesis of the study is that the addition of TTFields to standard of care second line therapies in advanced NSCLC will increase OS compared to treatment with standard second line alone. 512 patients with either squamous or non‐squamous NSCLC will be enrolled in this prospective, randomized study. Patients will be stratified based on: 1) second line therapy (either PD‐1 inhibitor or docetaxel), histology (squamous Vs. non‐squamous) and geographical region. The main eligibility criteria are first disease progression (per RECIST Criteria 1.1), ECOG score of 0‐1, no prior surgery or radiation therapy, no electronic medical devices in the upper torso and absence of brain metastasis. Docetaxel or PD‐1 inhibitors (either nivolumab or pembrolizumab) will be administered at the standard dose. TTFields will be applied to the upper torso using a small, portable medical device for at least 18 hours/day at home, allowing patients to maintain daily activities. TTFields will be continued until progression in the thorax and/or liver according to the immune‐related response criteria (irRC). Follow up will be performed once q6 weeks, including a CT scan of the chest and abdomen. Following progression in the upper torso, patients will be followed monthly for survival. The primary endpoint will be superiority in overall survival (OS) between patients treated with TTFields in combination with either docetaxel or PD‐1 inhibitors, compared to docetaxel or PD‐1 inhibitors alone. A co‐primary endpoint will compare the OS in patients treated with TTFields and docetaxel to those treated with PD‐1 inhibitors alone in a non‐inferiority analysis. Secondary endpoints include progression‐free survival, radiological response rate based on the irRC, quality of life based on the EORTC QLQ C30 questionnaire and severity and frequency of adverse events.

abstract = {Background: Early‐stage non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is treated surgically, but 30%e70% of patients experience post‐resection recurrence and succumb to disease. Adjuvant chemotherapy is the standard of care for fully resected NSCLC (stages IB [tumors ≥4 cm]‐IIIA), and although cisplatin‐based chemotherapy provides some benefit, the 5‐year absolute survival benefit is≈5%, underscoring the unmet need. Atezolizumab is an anti‐PDL1 monoclonal antibody that inhibits PD‐L1 from binding to its receptors PD‐1 and B7.1, thereby restoring anti‐tumor immune response. Atezolizumab monotherapy has demonstrated promising efficacy and tolerable safety in patients with previously‐treated advanced NSCLC, with a survival benefit observed across all PD‐L1 expression levels. Given the need to improve survival for patients with early‐stage NSCLC, IMpower010 (NCT02486718), a global Phase III randomized, open‐label trial, has been initiated to compare the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab with best supportive care (BSC), following adjuvant cisplatin‐based chemotherapy in patients with resected stage IB (tumors ≥4 cm)‐IIIA NSCLC. Methods: Eligibility criteria include complete tumor resection 4‐12 weeks prior to enrollment for pathologic stage IB (tumors ≥4 cm)eIIIA NSCLC. Patients must have adequately recovered from surgery, be eligible to receive cisplatin‐based adjuvant chemotherapy and have an ECOG PS 0‐1. Exclusion criteria include the presence of other malignancies, use of hormonal cancer or radiation therapy within 5 years, prior chemotherapy, autoimmune disease or exposure to prior immunotherapy. Approximately 1127 patients, regardless of PD‐L1 expression status, will be enrolled. Eligible patients will receive up to four 21‐day cycles of cisplatin‐based chemotherapy (cisplatin [75 mg/ m2 IV, day 1] + either vinorelbine [30 mg/m2 IV days 1, 8], docetaxel [75 mg/m2 IV day 1] or gemcitabine [1250 mg/ m2 IV days 1, 8], or pemetrexed [500mg/m2 IV day 1; nonsquamous NSCLC only]). Adjuvant radiation therapy is not permitted. Following adjuvant treatment, eligible patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive atezolizumab (1200 mg q3w, 16 cycles) or BSC. Stratification factors will include sex, histology (squamous vs non‐squamous), extent of disease (stage IB vs II vs IIIA) and PD‐L1 expression by IHC (TC, tumor cell; IC, tumor‐infiltrating immune cell; TC2/3 [≥5% expressing PD‐L1] and any IC vs TC0/1 [<5%] and IC2/3 [≥5%] vs TC0/1and IC0/1 [<5%]). The primary endpoint is disease‐free survival, and secondary endpoints include overall survival and safety. Exploratory endpoints include PD‐L1 status, immune and tumor related biomarkers before, during and after treatment with atezolizumab and at radiographic disease occurrence or confirmation of new primary NSCLC. Results: Section not applicable. Conclusion: Section not applicable.},

abstract = {Background: The current standard of care for patients (pts) diagnosed with unresectable, locally advanced esophageal squamous‐cell carcinoma (ESCC) is definitive platinum‐based concurrent chemoradiotherapy (dCRT). However, ESCC has poor prognosis, with more than half of tumors reoccurring after dCRT (Smyth et al. Nat Rev Dis Primers 2017), highlighting the need for additional therapy options in this setting. Cancer immunotherapies have demonstrated activity in ESCC, and targeted inhibition of the PD‐L1/PD‐1 pathway may be further amplified using novel anti‐TIGIT agents such as tiragolumab. In preclinical mouse models, concomitant blockade of PDL1/PD‐1 and TIGIT pathways demonstrated prolonged survival over the respective singleagents. In the phase II CITYSCAPE study (NCT03563716), tiragolumab plus atezolizumab (anti‐PD‐L1) resulted in a clinically meaningful improvement in PFS and higher ORR vs atezolizumab alone (31.3 vs 16.2%) in first‐line pts with PD‐L1+ (TPS ≥1%) metastatic NSCLC. SKYSCRAPER‐07 (NCT04543617) will determine if tiragolumab plus atezolizumab combination therapy provides superior clinical benefit to atezolizumab monotherapy or placebo in pts with unresectable ESCC whose cancers have not progressed following dCRT. We hypothesize that combination therapy will prolong PFS and OS compared with placebo in this setting. Methods: Eligible pts (≥18 years) must have unresectable ESCC, without progressive disease (PD) after platinum‐based dCRT (according to regional oncology guidelines for ESCC); ECOG PS 0‐1; no prior treatment with any immune checkpoint inhibitor. Approximately 750 pts will be randomized 1:1:1 to either Arm A (tiragolumab 600mg + atezolizumab 1200mg IV Q3W), Arm B (atezolizumab 1200mg + placebo IV Q3W) or Arm C (double placebo IV Q3W). Treatment will continue for up to 17 cycles of 21 days, or until unacceptable toxicity or investigator‐assessed radiographic PD (per RECIST v1.1). Stratification factors include geographic region (Asia vs rest of world), PD‐L1 expression and staging prior to dCRT (II vs III vs IV). Co‐primary efficacy endpoints are investigator‐assessed PFS and OS; key secondary endpoints include independent review facility‐assessed PFS and DoR. Safety, pharmacokinetic, biomarker and immunogenicity analyses will be performed. Recruitment is ongoing.},

abstract = {Background: Advanced medical imaging offers a chance for target volume reduction in modern radiotherapy, which may lead to more effective local treatments with reduced toxicity and offer the protection of draining lymph nodes and large vessels, possibly of importance for the upcoming combination of radiotherapy and immunotherapy. Locally advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with improvable local control and high toxicity is an excellent model to investigate this topic. Method: In the prospective randomised controlled PET‐Plan trial (NCT00697333), patients with inoperable stage II/III NSCLC and an indication for radiochemotherapy were randomized at a 1:1 ratio. In conventional arm A target volumes were informed by FDG‐PET and CT plus elective nodal irradiation and in experimental arm B they were solely informed by FDG‐PET. In both arms, quality assured isotoxically dose‐escalated IMRT or 3D‐CRT (60 ‐ 74Gy, 2Gy per fraction) was planned and applied to the respective target volumes along with simultaneous platinum‐based chemotherapy. The primary objective was time to locoregional progression (LRP) in terms of non‐inferiority of experimental arm B. Result: 311 patients were recruited, 205 patients included in the intent to treat (ITT) (A: n=99, B: n=106) and 172 patients in the per protocol (PP) analysis (A: n=84, B: n=88). Median FU time in the PP set was 16 months. Non‐inferiority of experimental arm B was confirmed for the pre‐specified non‐inferiority margin. The risk of LRP was lower in the experimental arm B (2y‐LRP 0.20 vs. 0.39; HR=0·57; 95% CI: 0·30–1·06; p=0·039) with no difference between study arms concerning survival (2y‐OS 0.57 vs. 0.54), out‐field recurrence and toxicity. Conclusion: In radiochemotherapy for locally advanced NSCLC PET‐Imaging based reduction of radiotherapy target volumes is feasible and may improve local control without increasing toxicity. However, in this trial there was no impact on survival. The procedures established in this clinical trial provide a radiotherapy standard for future NSCLC‐trials including immunotherapy and may furthermore inspire trials on imaging based target volume reduction for other types of tumours.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Soft tissue sarcomas are a heterogeneous and rare group of solid tumors of mesenchymal origin that can arise anywhere in the body. Although surgical resection is the mainstay of treatment for patients with localized disease, disease recurrence is common and 5‐year overall survival is poor (  65%). Both radiation therapy and conventional chemotherapy are used to reduce local and distant recurrence. However, the utility of radiation therapy is often limited by disease location (in the case of retroperitoneal sarcomas, for instance) while systemic therapy with conventional lines of chemotherapy offer limited efficacy and are often poorly tolerated and associated with significant toxicity. Within the past decade, major advances have been made in the treatment of other malignancies including melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, and non‐small cell lung carcinoma with the advent of immune‐checkpoint inhibitors such as ipilimumab (anti‐CTLA4), pembrolizumab (anti‐PD1), and nivolumab (anti‐PD1). The recently published SARC028 (NCT02301039), an open label, phase II, multicenter trial of pembrolizumab in patients with advanced bone and soft tissue sarcomas reported promising activity in select histologic subtypes of advanced STS, including undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma and dedifferentiated liposarcoma. METHODS: There is a clear need for novel and effective adjuncts in the treatment of STS. We hypothesize that immune checkpoint blockade will be effective in patients with surgically resectable primary or locally recurrent dedifferentiated liposarcoma and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma when administered in the neoadjuvant setting. The primary aim of this phase II, single‐center, open label, randomized non‐comparative trial is to determine the pathologic response to neoadjuvant nivolumab monotherapy and combination nivolumab/ipilimumab in patients with resectable dedifferentiated liposarcoma of the retroperitoneum or undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma of the trunk or extremity treated with concurrent standard of care neoadjuvant radiation therapy. DISCUSSION: This study will help define the role of single agent anti‐PD1 and combination anti‐CTLA4 and anti‐PD1 therapy in patients with surgically resectable dedifferentiated liposarcoma and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma.

abstract = {Introduction: The current standard of care in locally advanced NSCLC is concurrent chemo‐radiotherapy (CRT). However, many patients are treated with sequential CRT due to reduced fitness. Outcomes are poor (17‐28 months concurrent CRT; 14‐16 months sequential CRT) and new treatment approaches are urgently required. Two anti‐PD‐1 immune checkpoint inhibitors, nivolumab and pembrolizumab, have led to durable remissions in some NSCLC patients and FDA approval. Furthermore, radiotherapy (RT) can lead to immunogenic tumour cell death and adaptive upregulation of tumour PD‐L1 expression. Preclinical data has demonstrated improved efficacy of RT when combined with anti‐PD‐1 therapy, and scheduling of treatment may be relevant to outcome. We are translating these observations to a NSCLC clinical trial combining RT and anti‐PD‐1, with the following aims: 1) Establish a recommended phase‐II dose (RP2D) of pembrolizumab to combine with RT and determine safety profile. 2) Evaluate response (RECIST 1.1; immunerelated response criteria) and survival. 3) Exploratory: identify biomarkers of immunological response (change in PD‐L1 expression, T‐cell receptor diversity, neoantigen assessment). Methods: 1) Multi‐institution, open‐label, Phase‐I study of pembroli zumab combined with radical thoracic RT. 2) Patients with inoperable stage‐III NSCLC not suitable for concurrent CRT, or stage‐ IV NSCLC suitable for thoracic RT (low metastatic burden). 3) Treatment cohorts of 3‐6 patients (modified Fibonacci scheme, Fig. 1). 4) Pembrolizumab dose commencement of 200mg 3‐weekly concurrently with 60‐66 Gy (2 Gy/fraction) thoracic RT. Deescalation to 100mg if dose limiting toxicity. 5) An expanded cohort (13 patients) will be treated at RP2D to obtain additional safety and preliminary response data. 6) Maintenance pembrolizumab will continue up to 12 months post‐RT. Patients will be consented to a mandatory post‐RT biopsy. Biomarker blood samples will be taken before, during and after treatment. Results: PARIS will open in January 2017. Conclusion: Results of this study will be used to inform future randomised phase II trials with pembrolizumab.},

abstract = {The advent of immunotherapy in lung cancer with immune checkpoints inhibitors (CPIs) has first involved stage IV non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), recently in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy in first‐line setting. The rationale to combine chemotherapy with CPIs is theoretically based on the chemotherapy‐induced immunogenic cell death triggering an immune response and the modification of the tumor microenvironment (TME) by depletion of immunosuppressive cells. Radiotherapy remains one of the main components of the NSCLC treatment, from early stages with stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) and locally advanced stage III NSCLC in combination with chemotherapy to stage IV disease for the local palliative treatment of metastatic sites. Radiation therapy (RT) techniques have been considerably improved with image‐guidance, and technological developments in linear accelerators, allowing now a very precise delivery of radiation. Radiation biology has been mainly concentrated on radiation‐induced DNA damage with irreparable double strand break, leading to cell cycle inhibition and cell death. There are also a rationale and a preclinical evidence to expect a synergy between RT and CPIs. RT can also cause immunogenic cell death by direct cytotoxic effects, resulting in the release of tumor‐associated antigens (TAAs) and danger signals (DAMPs: damage associated molecular pattern) that can be recognized by toll‐like receptors, thus facilitating the presentation of TAAs to CD8+ T cells by MHC I. The dendritic cell activation and up‐regulation of interferon pathway also enhance TAAs presentation to immune cells and up‐regulate MHC‐1 expression on tumor cells. Radiotherapy can therefore act as an auto‐vaccine, activating the dendritic cells, broadening up the immune repertoire of T cells and increasing the "visibility” of TAAs. Beside this promotion of priming and activation of cytotoxic T cells, RT upregulates PD‐L1 expression in the TME. Nevertheless, the modification of TME induced by RT may be equivocal with on one hand an increase in the CD8+ T cells recruitment by up‐regulation of adhesion molecules, but on the other hand, the promotion of immune tolerance via the recruitment of MDSCs and Treg cells. Moreover, RT activates the immunosuppressive TGF‐β pathway by reactive oxygen species. In addition to the potential synergism in terms of local control, the RT might also mediate an abscopal effect, describing the tumor regression of lesions distant from the irradiated volume, due to circulating of T cells locally activated by RT. This phenomenon has been experimentally demonstrated in preclinical models and occasionally reported in case reports. In stage IV NSCLC, the impact of RT delivered on a metastatic site or on the primary tumor on CPIs anti‐tumor effect has been suggested by the retrospective analysis of the Keynote 001 phase I trial of pembrolizumab showing that patients who received radiotherapy before pembrolizumab had a better overall survival (OS) and progression‐free survival (PFS) than those patients who did not receive radiotherapy. Many ongoing trials are exploring the possibility to "boost” the activity of CPIs by the addition of local RT, especially SABR; these trials have to face many challenges in terms of treatment timing, radiation dosing, and minimization of the RT toxicity on local and circulating T‐cells. The main advance was brought in stage III NSCLC by the Pacific study which evaluated the impact of a treatment consolidation with durvalumab (anti‐PD‐L1), administered during 1 year after completion of concurrent chemoradiation therapy. This trial was a double‐blinded, 2:1 randomized versus placebo study; randomization was authorized between 1 and 42 days after the end of radiation therapy. PD‐L1 status was not required for enrollment. The majority of the 713 included patients were male, smokers and received a dose of radiotherapy between 54 and 66 Gy. The addition of durvalumab after concurrent chemo‐RTsignificantly improved both PFS (median 17.2 vs. 5.6 months, HR 0.51 95%CI, 0.41‐0.63) and OS at the first interim analysis (median not reached vs. 28.7 months, HR 0.68 99.73%CI, 0.469‐0.997). The effect of durvalumab was mainly due to a reduction of metastatic relapses, including brain metastases. Subgroups analysis showed a trend toward a greater magnitude of PFS and OS benefit for patients randomized early after completion of radiotherapy (<14 days). The exploratory analysis of the impact of PD‐L1 expression on the magnitude of benefit was planned with a cutoff at 25% for tumor cells. Knowing that 37% patients had no PD‐L1 assessment, the analysis showed a PFS benefit in both subgroups of patients and no OS benefit for patients with PD‐L1<25%. At the request of EMA, an additional unplanned subgroup analysis at the cutoff of 1% showed no PFS benefit and a trend toward a worse survival with durvalumab for the PD‐L1<1% tumors, due to an unexpected very good survival for patients randomized in the placebo group in this small subset of patients. While FDA approval of durvalumab was unrestricted, the European label is limited to the PD‐L1≥1% tumors, even if the statistical validity of the subgroup analysis is questionable. The risk of pneumonitis after radiation therapy was slightly increased in the durvalumab arm without significant augmentation of grade ≥3 events. Pacific was the first study demonstrating the potential for CPIs to obtain a potential synergy with radiation therapy, defining a new standard of care for these patients. However, further already ongoing clinical research will have to address the questions of a similar benefit with sequential chemoradiation therapy and of the optimization of this potential synergy by administering immunotherapy concurrently with thoracic radiotherapy as suggested by preclinical data. Potential long term toxicities must also be carefully assessed. Another area of further development of RT and CPIs combinations actually investigated is the incorporation of immunotherapy after SABR in the treatment of early stage NSCLC. The combination of RT and immunotherapy has proven effective in preclinical studies and in stage III NSCLC. A lot of challenges still exist to harness the combination of chemotherapy, RT and CPIs, especially in terms of timing, irradiated volume, fractionation, and dose that likely play a major role in the modulation of the RT different effects on the tumor cells, the immune response and the TME.

Herein, the efficacy of ex vivo TKD/IL‐2 activated, autologous NK cells was tested in a randomized, investigator initiated phase II clinical trial in patients with mHsp70 positive advanced stage NSCLC after radiochemotherapy (RCT, 60‐70 Gy, platinum‐based chemotherapy). The interventional (INT) group received 4 cycles TKD/IL‐2 activated, autologous NK cells every 2‐6 weeks subsequent to standard RCT and the control (CTRL) group received best supportive care. The primary objective of the study was to examine whether the adjuvant treatment of NSCLC patients with TKD/IL‐2 activated NK cells is feasible and effective with respect to progression‐free survival (PFS). Secondary objectives were the assessment of treatment and biological responses, toxicity, quality‐of‐life (QoL, QLQ‐LC13). Eight patients were randomized into the INT and eight into the CTRL arm. None of the patients died between randomization and final tumor assessment 18 months after randomization. In the INT group one patient had complete response (CR), one patient partial response (PR), two patients stable disease (SD) and one patient progressive disease (PD) at the last documented visit, whereas in the CTRL group only 2 patients showed clinical responses (PR, SD) and five patients had PD. The clinical response of patients in the INT group appeared to be mediated by activated NK cells whereas in the CTRL group by CD8 T cells. The NK cell therapy after RCT was well tolerated, no differences in QoL were observed between both study groups.},

Previous clinical trials using autologous T cells directed against NY‐ESO‐1/LAGE‐1a have shown objective responses between 40% and 60% in synovial sarcoma, metastatic melanoma and multiple myeloma. Pembrolizumab (PEM) is a monoclonal antibody that blocks PD‐1/PD‐L1 interaction and increases anti‐tumour activity in anti‐tumour T cells. Here, PEM will be used in combination with NY‐ESO‐1/LAGE‐1a T‐cell receptor engineered patient T cells (GSK3377794) to potentially improve clinical benefit in this patient population. Trial design: This is a phase Ib/IIa, randomised, multi‐arm, open‐label study (NCT03709706) of GSK3377794 in HLA‐A∗02:01, HLA‐A∗02:05 and/or HLA‐A∗02:06 positive adults with NY‐ESO‐1 and/or LAGE‐1a‐expressing tumours. Eligible patients with unresectable Stage IIIb/IV NSCLC are either ineligible for standard‐of‐care chemoradiotherapy, have received PD‐1 therapy or appropriate targeted therapy, have terminated prior treatment due to intolerable side effects, or have refused standard approved treatment. At least 30 patients with NSCLC without EGFR or ALK/ROS1 aberrations will be randomised (1:1) to Arm A or B; at least 15 patients with EGFR or ALK/ROS1 aberration will be assigned to Arm C.

EA5142, a trial of adjuvant nivolumab for patients (pts) without EGFR / ALK alterations, has completed enrollment. Given the survival benefit seen with 1stline chemo‐immunotherapy (chemo‐IO) for advanced NSCLC without EGFR / ALK alterations, there was compelling rationale for the launch of a trial offering concurrent immunotherapy with adjuvant chemo. Here we report updated enrollment to ALCHEMIST as of Jan 14, 2020. Methods: ALCHEMIST includes a screening trial (A151216, 5362 registered) that enrolls pts with completely resected clinical stage IB (≥4 cm)‐IIIA (per AJCC 7) NSCLC. Tissue and blood are collected, biomarker testing includes EGFR sequencing, ALK FISH and PD‐L1 IHC. 733 active sites are enrolling across the NCTN. Pts with EGFR mutations may enroll to adjuvant erlotinib vs observation (A081105, 352 randomized); those with ALK fusions may enroll to adjuvant crizotinib vs observation (E4512, 99 randomized). A trial offering adjuvant nivolumab vs observation regardless of PDL1 status (EA5142, 935 randomized) recently completed enrollment. To support ongoing investigation of adjuvant immunotherapy, ALCHEMIST is adding A081801 (opens spring 2020). Pts will be randomized to one of 3 arms: chemo‐IO with pembrolizumab during and after chemo vs sequential chemo followed by pembrolizumab vs chemo alone. Pts with pathological N2 nodes are eligible and can undergo postoperative radiotherapy after completing chemo. Pts are eligible if enrolled to A151216, negative for EGFR and ALK alterations, and with PD‐L1 testing completed (required for stratification). Local testing for EGFR, ALK and PD‐L1 will be accepted for enrollment; central testing will not delay randomization. Pts may not have received any therapy except surgery for the lung cancer and must be age >18, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0‐1, have no active autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment within 2 years, must not be pregnant or nursing, have no active second malignancy within 3 years and meet standard organ function values. By building off the ongoing ALCHEMIST platform, we hope to facilitate rapid enrollment to A081801 across participating NCTN sites.},

abstract = {Purpose/Objective(s): For patients with advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with Immunotherapy (ImT), checkpoint inhibitor pneumonitis (CIP) is an uncommon and sometimes life‐threatening adverse event that may be underreported. Recent studies suggest that radiomic analysis of pre‐ImT imaging can predict CIP. We hypothesized that for patients with advanced NSCLC treated with Nivolumab monotherapy, pre‐ImT radiotherapy (RT) is predictive of CIP and that radiomics features can identify CIP that has been clinically misclassified. Materials/Methods: From an IRB‐approved database (DB) of 159 patients with advanced NSCLC treated with Nivolumab, chart review identified 9 patients diagnosed with CIP of any grade (6%). 40 additional patients from the same DB without diagnosis of CIP were randomly selected for analysis. For all patients, baseline characteristics including pre‐ImT RT were collected for comparison between CIP and non‐CIP groups. Both lungs were contoured semi‐automatically through thresholding on the last pre‐ImT CT imaging studies, with intrathoracic lesions subtracted from the lung volumes prior to radiomics analysis. A logistic regression model incorporating radiomics assigned a CIP probability score to every patient. Results: Six radiomics features correlated with CIP (p‐values range from 0.02 to 0.03). Each feature had an AUC of ∼0.79 (range 0.789 to 0.794) showing large effect size, with odds ratios greater than 3.50 (4 features) or less than 0.3 (2 features). While pre‐ImT thoracic RT was not predictive of pneumonitis, pre‐ImT RT irrespective of treatment location was borderline predictive with high effect size (p = 0.09, OR 0.27). The radiomics‐based probability model assigned 7/42 patients (16.7%) without clinical diagnosis of CIP a greater than 50% probability of CIP. Chart and imaging review revealed that 6/7 “misclassified” patients exhibited symptoms or radiographic features highly suggestive of CIP. These findings originally were attributed to disease progression or clinically overshadowed by other symptoms. Conclusion: For patients with advanced NSCLC treated with Nivolumab, the incidence of checkpoint‐inhibitor pneumonitis (CIP) is underreported and radiomics features can help identify CIP that has been clinically misclassified. Preliminary findings suggest that pre‐ImT RT irrespective of treatment location may be predictive of CIP, and therefore that immunomodulatory effects of RT‐ImT synergy are not restricted to the local irradiated area. Future directions include expansion of this study across the full database, correlation of radiomics features with blood and tissue biomarkers, and the inclusion of tumor burden as an additional covariate in the analysis.},

abstract = {Over the last decade, several steps forward in the treatment of patients with stage IV non‐small cell lung cancer (NCSLC) were made. Examples are the use of pemetrexed, pemetrexed maintenance therapy, or bevacizumab for patients with nonsquamous NSCLC. A big leap forward was the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in patients selected on the basis of an activating oncogene, such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activating mutations or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) translocations. However, all of these achievements could not be translated into survival benefits when studied in randomized controlled trials in patients with nonmetastatic NSCLC. Aside from chemotherapy and targeted therapy, immunotherapy has become the third pillar in the treatment armamentarium of advanced NSCLC. Antigen‐specific immunotherapy (cancer vaccination) has been disappointing in large phase III clinical trials in stages I–III NSCLC. Based on the recent breakthroughs with immune checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy in metastatic NSCLC, much hope currently rests on the use of this approach in patients with stage I–III NSCLC as well. Here we give a brief overview of how most new therapeutic approaches for advanced NSCLC failed in other stages, and then elaborate on the role of immunotherapy in patients with stage I–III NSCLC.},

abstract = {Background: The standard treatment for unresectable, locally advanced NSCLC is concurrent chemoradiotherapy followed by durvalumab. While the effectiveness of chemoradiotherapy is pivotal, the exploration into predictive factors of the efficacy is notably limited. Methods: The Japanese Lung Cancer Society (JLCS) integrated eight randomized Phase II/III trials (JCOG9812, JCOG0301, NJLCG0601, OLCSG0007, SPECTRA, TORG1018, WJOG5008L, WJTOG0105) concerning chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced NSCLC, constructing the JLCS Integrated Clinical Trial Database (JIDB), with individual data of 1288 patients. This study analyzed 1162 patients who underwent concurrent chemoradiotherapy, focusing on factors impacting PFS. A logistic regression with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) analyses for 3‐yr PFS were performed, and the five most related factors were further evaluated using the Kaplan‐ Meier method and log‐rank tests. The impact of pneumonitis and esophagitis on PFS was also explored. Results: Age [median (Q1;Q3)]; 64 (57;71), male/female; 961/201, Ad/Sq/Oth; 580/ 446/134, PS 0/1/2; 562/578/5, stage IIIA/IIIB; 468/694, T factor 4/3/2/1/0; 436/158/341/156/3, N factor 3/2/1/0; 300/692/44/62, PS 0/1/2; 562/578/5, primary site; upper, middle/lower lobe; 599/161, BMI; 21.8 (19.7;24.0), weight loss (≥5% within 6m) yes/no; 135/644, LDH (IU/l); 203 (175;276), CRP (mg/dl); 0.70 (0.20;2.60), irradiated dose (Gy); 60 (60;60), combined regimen; platinum/taxane 303, CDDP/mitomycin/vindesine; 254, CDDP/5‐FU‐based; 196, CDDP/ vinorelbine 87, CDDP/pemetrexed 50, others 272. The median PFS in all patients was 9.72m (95% CI; 9.33 ‐ 10.38), with 3‐yr, 5‐yr, and 10‐yr PFS rates of 19.7, 14.3, 10.1%. LASSO logistic regression identified Sq, lower lobe primary, age, pack‐years, and weight loss as the top negative influencers. The PFS curve was significantly shorter in patients with lower lobe primary (median of 8.15 vs. 9.46m, p = 0.023) and weight loss (median of 7.29 vs. 9.72m, p < 0.0001). Pneumonitis occurred in 50.9% (grade≥3 in 6.7%) and esophagitis in 41.9% (grade≥3 in 3.9%). Grade≥2 pneumonitis shortened PFS (8.2 vs. 10.2m, p = 0.00015), while, unexpectedly, grade≥1 esophagitis was associated with longer PFS (12.9 vs. 8.6m, p < 0.0001). Conclusions: The efficacy of concurrent chemoradiotherapy varies significantly based on the primary site. Weight loss is a significant predictor of efficacy, as is in metastatic disease. The impact of pneumonitis and esophagitis suggest that modifying lung and esophageal irradiation might enhance treatment efficacy. Further research in this area is still certainly warranted.},

abstract = {Background: There are approximately 35,000 cases of stage I lung cancer in the United States each year. While these patients have better 5‐ year overall survival (OS) rates than their counterparts with locally advanced and metastatic disease, there is still considerable room for improvement. Based on a recent publication validating the 8 edition of the TNM classification, the 5‐year OS for node‐negative pathologically‐staged NSCLC between 1‐4cm ranges from 73‐86%, and recurrence rates for resected stage I NSCLC can range from 18‐38%. Previous studies looking at adjuvant chemotherapy in this setting have shown no benefit for stage IA tumors, and the current standard of care is observation alone. Checkpoint blockade with PD‐1/PD‐L1 inhibitors has shown considerable activity in NSCLC including in metastatic disease, as consolidation in stage III disease after chemoradiation, and in studies evaluating neoadjuvant immunotherapy. Given this activity and their favorable safety profile, we designed a study of adjuvant PD‐1 inhibition following resection in stage I NSCLC. Methods: This study is a randomized phase II multicenter trial of adjuvant Pembrolizumab versus observation alone following complete resection of stage I NSCLC with tumors between 1‐4cm. The trial will enroll 368 patients randomized 1:1 to either Pembrolizumab 400mg IV every 6 weeks for up to 9 cycles or observation alone with scheduled CT scans and routine clinical follow‐up. Stratification factors include PD‐L1 ≥50% vs. < 50% and tumor size of 1‐2cm vs. > 2‐4cm. Thelead site is Indiana University, and the trial will be conducted through the Big Ten Cancer Research Consortium. The primary endpoint is disease free survival (DFS), and secondary endpoints include OS, DFS at 1‐, 2‐, and 3‐year time points, and toxicity. The trial opened to accrual at the lead site in May 2020, and there are currently 6 patients enrolled.},

abstract = {Background: Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) is a novel, non‐invasive, anti‐mitotic treatment modality, based on low intensity alternating electric fields. TTFields predominantly affect two phases of mitosis: metaphase ‐ by disrupting the mitotic spindle, and cytokinesis ‐ by dielectrophoretic dislocation of organelles. TTFields were shown to extend the survival of newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients when combined with temozolomide. Efficacy of TTFields in non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) of all histologies has been demonstrated multiple preclinical models as well as in a phase I/II study in combination with pemetrexed, where overall survival was extended in more than five months compared to historical controls. Methods: The hypothesis of the study is that the addition of TTFields to standard of care second line therapies in advanced NSCLC will increase OS compared to treatment with standard second line alone. 512 patients with either squamous or non‐squamous NSCLC will be enrolled in this prospective, randomized study. Patients will be stratified based on: 1) second line therapy (either PD‐1 inhibitor or docetaxel), histology (squamous Vs. non‐squamous) and geographical region. The main eligibility criteria are first disease progression (per RECIST Criteria 1.1), ECOG score of 0‐1, no prior surgery or radiation therapy, no electronic medical devices in the upper torso and absence of brain metastasis. Docetaxel or PD‐1 inhibitors (nivolumab or pembrolizumab) will be administered at the standard dose. TTFields will be applied to the upper torso using a small, portable medical device for at least 18 hours/day at home, allowing patients to maintain daily activities. TTFields will be continued until progression in the thorax and/or liver according to the immune‐related response criteria (irRC). Follow up will be performed once q6 weeks, including a CT scan. Following progression in the upper torso, patients will be followed monthly for survival. The primary endpoint will be superiority in overall survival (OS) between patients treated with TTFields in combination with either docetaxel or PD‐1 inhibitors, compared to docetaxel or PD‐1 inhibitors alone. A coprimary endpoint will compare the OS in patients treated with TTFields and docetaxel to those treated with PD‐1 inhibitors alone in a non‐inferiority analysis. Secondary endpoints include progression‐free survival, radiological response rate based on the irRC, quality of life based on the EORTC QLQ C30 questionnaire and severity & frequency of adverse events. The sample size is powered to detect a Hazard Ratio of 0.75 of TTFieldstreated patients compare to the control group.},

abstract = {Background: Non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents >80% of lung cancer cases worldwide and 30% of patients (pts) present with Stage III disease. Historically, platinum‐based CRT has been the standard of care (SoC) for such pts, yet outcomes are poor. Durvalumab (durva) is a selective, high‐affinity, human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that blocks PD‐L1 binding to PD‐1 and CD80. Results from the PACIFIC trial of durva in pts with locally advanced, unresectable, Stage III NSCLC, who did not progress on concurrent CRT (cCRT), showed significant improvements in progression‐free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) with durva vs placebo (PFS: HR 0.52; 95% CI 0.42‐0.65; P < 0.001; OS: HR 0.68; 99.73% CI 0.47‐0.997; P = 0.0025), and similar safety profiles (Antonia et al, NEJM 2017; 2018). Consequently, treatment with durva after CRT, the PACIFIC regimen, is quickly becoming the new SoC. However, the PACIFIC trial only assessed pts who had received cCRT, but due to the higher toxicity of this approach, some patients may be better suited to sequential CRT (sCRT). Therefore, the objective of the PACIFIC‐5 (NCT03706690) study is to assess durva post‐CRT in a broader population, including pts with NSCLC who did not progress following either platinum‐based cCRT or sCRT. Trial design: PACIFIC‐5 is a phase 3, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, multicenter study. Approximately 360 pts with histologically or cytologically confirmed Stage III, locally advanced, unresectable NSCLC will be enrolled from China and the rest of the world. Eligible pts have not progressed following definitive, platinum‐based cCRT or sCRT, and are in complete response, partial response or have stable disease. Pts are being randomized 2:1 to receive either durva (1500 mg i.v.) every 4 weeks, or placebo, until disease progression, toxicity or withdrawal of consent. The primary endpoint is PFS per blinded independent central review; OS is the key secondary endpoint. Other secondary endpoints include OS24, overall response rate, duration of response, PFS2, PFS12, PFS18, time to distant metastases, pt‐reported outcomes, durva pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity, and safety assessments.

abstract = {INTERVENTION: Participants receive the first dose of pembrolizumab two weeks before the start of radiotherapy. Pembrolizumab is subsequently delivered every three weeks, starting on the first day of radiotherapy and are continued after completion of radiotherapy for up to 12 months. Participants receive radiotherapy for up to six and a half weeks. As this combination of treatment has not been given before, participants are registered initially into a dose finding phase where dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) is monitored during and for 12 weeks after completion of combined pembrolizumab and thoracic radiotherapy at each dose level in order to confirm the recommended phase II dose. Participants are given a different dose of pembrolizumab treatment depending on the group or ‘cohort’ they are recruited into. The starting dose of pembrolizumab for the first patients are 200 mg (dose level 1). This dose may be reduced to a dose of 100 mg (dose level ‐1) if unacceptable numbers of dose limiting toxicities are experienced at dose level 1. A maximum of 12 participants are treated in the dose finding part of the study aiming to establish the recommended phase II dose (RP2D). Once the recommended phase II dose is found, an expanded cohort of 13 participants are treated at this dose of pembrolizumab to obtain further safety data. During radiotherapy treatment the patient are seen weekly for follow‐up. After completion of combination pembrolizumab and radiotherapy treatment, patient visits are scheduled at these time‐points: 1. Weekly visits until toxicity resolved to grade 0‐1 after radiotherapy. Patients in the dose finding cohort will also be seen weekly to week four regardless of toxicity. 2. Patients on maintenance Pembrolizumab: Three weekly visit up to 12 months 3. Patients not on maintenance Pembrolizumab: Monthly visits for up to four months post RT and then at months six, nine and 12. 4.

Recommended phase II dose is measured using the amount of participants in the dose finding phase experiencing dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in the time period during and for 12 weeks after treatment with combined Pembrolizumab and thoracic radiotherapy; 2. Dose limiting toxicity is measured using toxicities experienced from the start of treatment to 12 weeks post combination therapy SECONDARY OUTCOME: 1. Safety profile of Pembrolizumab combined with thoracic RT (acute and late toxicity) is measured by assessing the occurrence of SAEs, SARs, and SUSARs until 90 days after the participant has stopped trial treatment. The toxicity profile is measured by assessing the occurrence of adverse events until 30 days after the participant has stopped trial treatment.; 2. Treatment compliance of Pembrolizumab combined with thoracic RT is measured by recording dose reductions, delays, omissions, and withdrawals throughout each participant’s treatment on the study; 3. Best overall response to Pembrolizumab combined with thoracic RT is measured using the RECIST criteria from the start of treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started); 4. Best overall response to Pembrolizumab combined with thoracic RT measured according to immune‐related response criteria (irRC) is measured as the best confirmed irRC overall response over the study as a whole, recorded between the date of first dose until the last tumour assessment before subsequent therapy (except for local palliative radiotherapy for painful bone lesions) for the individual participant; 5. Progression‐free survival is measured using date of registration to first documented evidence of disease progression or death; 6. Overall survival is measured from participant records from date of registration to death INCLUSION CRITERIA: 1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed NSCLC 2.

abstract = {Management of EGFR mutation(+) Locally Advanced Non‐Small Cell Lung Cancer Keunchil Park, MD, PhD Division of Hematology‐Oncology, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea The standard of care for the locally advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (LA‐NSCLC) is concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT). Recently, the addition of consolidation immune checkpoint inhibitor following CCRT demonstrated improved outcome and is now recommended as the new standard of care for this heterogeneous group of LA‐NSCLC patients. In advanced/metastatic setting EGFR mutation (+), NSCLC cancer patients define a unique subset with a dramatic response to the EGFR TKIs. Currently, molecular profiling of tumor tissue for EGFR mutations (as part of multiplex testing) is a routine procedure at the time of initial diagnosis of patients with recurrent or metastatic NSCLC. For advanced or metastatic EGFR mutant NSCLC patients EGFR TKI therapy is the treatment of choice and the median overall survival is >30 months. Despite the great success of EGFR TKI in metastatic NSCLC, the role of EGFR TKIs in LA‐NSCLC is less well defined and controversial. Early clinical trials in unselected NSCLC patients failed to demonstrate the benefits of EGFR‐TKIs as an adjuvant treatment. The first prospective randomized phase III trial to investigate the role of EGFR TKI in earlier stage NSCLC includes the SWOG 0023 study (J Clin Oncol 2008;26:2450‐6) which failed to support the role of maintenance gefitinib (versus placebo) following definitive chemoradiation in unresectable stage III NSCLC. The CALGB 30106 phase II study also failed to show the benefits of adding gefitinib to sequential or concurrent chemoradiotherapy in unresectable stage III NSCLC (J Thorac Oncol 2010;5:1382‐90). And the randomized prospective placebo‐controlled adjuvant gefitinib trial in unselected patients with stage IB–IIIA resected disease (BR.19) was prematurely closed (J Clin Oncol 2013;31:3320‐6). Another randomized double‐blind trial in adjuvant NSCLC with tarceva (RADIANT) in patients with completely resected state IB to IIIA NSCLC whose tumors expressed EGFR protein by immunohistochemistry or EGFR amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization did not show prolonged DFS (J Clin Oncol 2015;33:4007‐14). The prognostic or predictive value of EGFR mutation in early stage NSCLC patients is not well defined. In a retrospective single institutional analysis (J Thorac Oncol. 2012;7: 1815–1822), patients with resected stage I–III lung cancers and EGFR mutation have a lower risk of death compared to patients without EGFR mutation. There was a trend toward improvement in DFS among individuals with resected stages I to III lung adenocarcinomas harboring mutations in EGFR exon 19 or 21 who received adjuvant EGFR TKI therapy (J Thorac Oncol 2011;6:569–575). There have been recently reported several prospective trials of adjuvant EGFR TKI in early stage NSCLC patients enriched with EGFR mutation. CTONG1104 study (ADJUVANT), a randomized, open‐label, phase III trial of adjuvant gefitinib for 24 months versus intravenous vinorelbine plus cisplatin for 4 cycles in patients with completely resected (R0), stage II–IIIA (N1–N2), EGFR‐mutant (exon 19 deletion or exon 21 Leu858Arg) NSCLC, demonstrated that adjuvant gefitinib compared to cisplatin‐based chemotherapy significantly increases disease‐free survival, diminishes toxic effects, and improves HRQoL in patients with completely resected stage II–IIIA EGFR‐mutant NSCLC (Lancet Oncol 2018; 19: 139–48). In the phase II SELECT trial, adjuvant erlotinib for 2 years in patients with resected stage IA to IIIA EGFR‐mutant NSCLC after standard adjuvant chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy (J Clin Oncol 2019;37:97‐104) showed an improved 2‐year DFS. Patients rechallenged with erlotinib after recurrence experienced durable benefits. There are also some neoadjuvant trials of EGFR TKI for locally advanced NSCLC. RTOG 1306, a randomized phase II study of individualized combined modality therapy for stage III NSCLC (12‐weeks of either erlotinib hydrochloride or crizotinib followed by chemoradiation therapy in stage III NSCLC with EGFR TK mutations or EML4‐ ALK fusion). The primary objective was to assess whether patients with unresectable LA‐NSCLC treated with EGFR or ALK TK targeted agents based on molecular characteristics have a longer progression‐free survival than those treated with standard care therapy alone. The study was, however, unfortunately prematurely terminated due to poor accrual (NCT01822496). CTONG 1103 is an open‐label, randomized trial that compared the efficacy and safety of erlotinib versus gemcitabine plus cisplatin neoadjuvant therapy in patients with exon 19 or 21 EGFR mutations and untreated resectable stage IIIA‐N2 NSCLC. The study did not meet the primary end point of ORR with 42 days of neoadjuvant erlotinib, but the secondary end point PFS was significantly improved (J Clin Oncol 37. © 2019; published at on June 13, 2019: DOI ) There are also several ongoing clinical trials of EGFR TKIs in resected stage IB ‐ IIIA NSCLC with activating EGFR mutations. The Adjuvant Lung Cancer Enrichment Marker Identification and Sequencing Trial (ALCHEMIST) is a prospective randomized double‐blind placebo‐controlled trial to investigate the benefits of the addition of molecularly targeted agents after standard postoperative chemotherapy in patients with resected NSCLC (Clin Cancer Res:2015; 21(24); 5439–44). It is worth noting that the primary objective for the ALCHEMIST adjuvant trials is overall survival (OS). ADAURA, a randomized phase III trial (osimertinib vs. placebo in patients with stage IB‐IIIA NSCLC, following complete tumor resection with or without adjuvant chemotherapy; NCT02511106) has been designed to assess the efficacy and safety of adjuvant osimertinib versus placebo in patients with resected stage IB‐IIIA EGFR mutation‐positive (Ex19Del or L858R) NSCLC. The primary efficacy objective is DFS. In brief, many neoadjuvant/adjuvant EGFR TKI trials in earlier stage of NSCLC have demonstrated its safety and feasibility with an improved DFS esp. in EGFR mutation(+) LA‐NSCLC. However, the real question should be “Can we improve the ‘overall survival’ and thus ultimately the ‘cure rate’ of locally advanced NSCLC with EGFR mutation?” In order to address this issue, there remain several critical questions to be answered, e.g., who is most likely to benefit from adjuvant EGFR TKI, what is the optimal duration of adjuvant TKI, what is the best regimen, etc. Whether the earlier introduction of EGFR targeted therapy in less advanced NSCLC would lead to improved ‘Cure Rate’ remains to be seen in future prospective trials in a larger number of EGFR mutation(+) patients.

abstract = {Purpose/Objective(s): Preclinical studies show radiation therapy to enhance antitumor immune responses; however, clinical data on the impact of radiation therapy on the efficacy and toxicity of checkpoint immunotherapy is limited. We therefore sought to determine if patients who previously received radiation therapy for their non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC) would have enhanced disease control with pembrolizumab treatment and if patients with prior thoracic radiation would have more pulmonary toxicity with pembrolizumab treatment. Purpose/Objective(s): We present a secondary analysis of the phase 1 KEYNOTE‐001 trial. Patients (n = 97) had metastatic NSCLC and were treated at a single institution with pembrolizumab at a dose of either 2 mg or 10 mg/kg q 3 weeks or 10 mg/kg q 2 weeks. Disease response and pulmonary toxicity were prospectively assessed by the investigator using the immune related response criteria (irRC) and CTCAE grading. Patients were divided into subgroups to compare patients who previously received radiation for the treatment of their NSCLC to patients without a history of prior radiation with regards to progression‐free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) and pulmonary toxicity. Results: Among all patients, 43% previously received any radiation therapy (RT), 39% received extracranial radiation therapy (ERT) and 25% specifically received thoracic radiation therapy (TRT) for the treatment of their NSCLC. All radiation was delivered prior to the first dose of pembrolizumab. Patients with prior RT had a significantly longer PFS with pembrolizumab treatment vs. patients without prior RT (6 month PFS: 44.3% vs. 22.9%, P = 0.04). Patients with ERT had a significantly longer PFS with pembrolizumab vs. patients without ERT (median PFS: 4.1 months vs. 2.0 months; 6 month PFS: 49.3% vs. 21.4%, P < 0.01). On multivariate analysis both prior RT and ERT independently predicted for improved PFS with pembrolizumab treatment (HR, 0.60, 95% CI 0.37‐0.94, P = 0.03, and HR, 0.53, 95% CI, 0.33‐0.86, P = 0.01, respectively). Patients with prior RT and ERT also had a significantly longer OS with pembrolizumab treatment than patients without prior RT or ERT (P = 0.05 and P = 0.03, respectively). Patients with prior TRT had more overall treatment‐related pulmonary toxicity (12.5% vs. 1.4%, P = 0.04), and pneumonitis (12.5% vs. 2.7%, P = 0.09) with pembrolizumab treatment. However, the rates of any ≥ grade 3 pulmonary toxicities were similar (12.5% vs. 9.6%. P = 0.7). Conclusion: Patients treated with pembrolizumab on the phase 1 KEYNOTE‐001 trial who previously received radiation therapy had a significantly longer progression‐free and overall survival with pembrolizumab treatment. Overall, these data suggest an acceptable safety profile and a promising efficacy with the combination of radiation therapy and pembrolizumab for the treatment of advanced NSCLC.},

abstract = {Introduction: Previous NK cell role with pembrolizumab for advanced NSCLC showed better efficacy than pembrolizumab alone. However, the prolonged effect of NK cells with pembrolizumab was not evaluated yet. This study evaluates the role of NK cells with pembrolizumab for more than 2 years from a previous randomized controlled trial. Methods: This trial recruited 20 patients with advanced NSCLC with a PD‐L1 tumor proportion score of 1% or greater who failed prior frontline platinum‐based therapy were randomized to receive pembrolizumab with SNK01 (N=14) or pembrolizumab monotherapy(n=6). Among the group treated with Pembrolizumab plus NK cell, two different doses were administered with 2 x 109 cells/dose (N = 7) and 4 x 109 cells/dose (N = 7). Patients who showed more than grade 3 adverse event were excluded in the analysis. The primary study endpoint was overall survival (OS), the secondary endpoint was progression‐free survival. Kaplan‐Meier curve was used to compare the treatment and the p‐value was calculated by log‐rank test. Results: Among the 20 patients, 2 patients were excluded for serious adverse event (N=1, arthralgia might related to pembrolizumab, N=1; pneumonia not related to NK cell). 11 patients have died and 5 patients from the pembrolizumab + NK cell group (41.6%, n=5/12), and 6 patients from pembrolizumab monotherapy (100%, n=6/6). The estimated two‐year survival rate was 58.3% vs 16.7% (Pembrolizumab + NK cell vs Pembrolizumab monotherapy). The hazard ratio (HR) of survival was 0.32 [95% CI: 0.1, 1.08, p‐value: 0.066]. The Survival rate did not statistically differ between the two NK cell dose groups. The median PFS was 6.2 vs 1.7 months (Pembrolizumab + NK cells vs Pembrolizumab monotherapy), with significantly higher PFS by log‐rank test [HR 0.15 95% CI: 0.05ￚ0.53, p‐value: 0.003]. The PFS did not statistically differ between the two NK cell dose groups. Conclusions: Although the number of participants was small, this study shows that NK cells with pembrolizumab could be better than pembrolizumab alone for NSCLC. Moreover, prolonged PFS of more than 2 years of NK cells with pembrolizumab might represent the prolonged effect of pembrolizumab and NK cells.

abstract = {Background: For patients with advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), particularly those with adenocarcinoma lacking a driver mutation, the encroachment upon the recurrent laryngeal nerve causing hoarseness presents a substantial challenge in treatment. Such patients, at TNM stage IIIB or higher, may undergo platinum‐based doublet chemotherapy combined with concurrent or sequential radiotherapy. Despite these treatments, survival rates remain modest, and quality of life is significantly impaired by symptoms such as hoarseness, dysphagia, and coughing. Recently, pembrolizumab combined with chemotherapy has emerged as a frontline treatment for adenocarcinoma patients, showing promising outcomes in unresectable, advanced stages of the disease. However, its efficacy in patients experiencing hoarseness due to recurrent laryngeal nerve involvement has not been previously investigated. Methods: Between September 2018 and October 2022, Jiangmen Central Hospital admitted 71 patients with advanced adenocarcinoma and hoarseness, who lacked a driver mutation as confirmed by NGS testing. After excluding patients who did not complete the treatment plan, the remaining subjects were randomly divided into two groups. The treatment group, consisting of 21 patients, received pembrolizumab, pemetrexed, and platinum‐based doublet chemotherapy. The control group, also comprising 21 patients, underwent concurrent or sequential radiotherapy alongside pemetrexed and platinum‐based chemotherapy. Results: Among the treatment group, hoarseness was reversed in 13 out of 21 patients, with a return to normal vocal function. In the control group, 5 out of 21 patients experienced a reversal of hoarseness. The treatment group showed superior outcomes in reversing hoarseness caused by recurrent laryngeal nerve involvement (p=0.013). The objective response rate (ORR) in the treatment group was 28.57%, with a disease control rate (DCR) of 66.67%. In contrast, the control group had an ORR of 9.52% and a DCR of 28.57% (p<0.05). The Progression‐Free Survival (PFS), as calculated by the Kaplan‐Meier survival curve method, was 11.77 months (95% CI: 11.19‐12.35) in the treatment group and 7.53 months (95% CI: 6.73‐8.33) in the control group, indicating a significantly higher survival rate in the treatment group (p<0.05). Conclusions: In patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma, pembrolizumab combined with chemotherapy appears to effectively reverse hoarseness caused by recurrent laryngeal nerve involvement, higher objective response rates, and increased PFS. This suggests the necessity for multicentric, prospective, evidence‐based studies in the treatment of lung adenocarcinoma patients with hoarseness due to recurrent laryngeal nerve invasion.},

abstract = {Purpose/Objective(s): Pembrolizumab, an anti‒PD‐1 antibody is standard of care therapy for metastatic non‒small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC) as monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy. Durvalumab, an anti–PD‐L1 antibody, is approved for unresectable, stage III NSCLC without disease progression following CCRT. Early trials of pembrolizumab in combination with chemoradiotherapy, either concurrently or as consolidation, showed acceptable tolerability and promising PFS in patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC. Early data suggest the combination of poly(ADP‐ribose) polymerase (PARP) plus anti–PD‐(L)1 inhibition can enhance treatment effects. KEYLYNK‐012 (NCT04380636) is evaluating pembrolizumab plus CCRT followed by pembrolizumab with/without the PARP inhibitor olaparib vs CCRT followed by durvalumab in patients with unresectable, locally advanced, stage III NSCLC. Materials/Methods: This global phase 3, randomized, placebo‐ and active‐controlled, double‐blind study is enrolling patients aged ≥18 y with previously untreated, pathologically confirmed, stage IIIA–C NSCLC, an ECOG PS of 0 or 1, and a tumor sample available for PD‐L1 evaluation. Patients are randomized 1:1:1 to CCRT (platinum‐doublet chemotherapy [cisplatin plus pemetrexed or etoposide; or carboplatin plus paclitaxel] plus radiotherapy 60 Gy over 6 wks [cycles 2–3]) with pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W (groups A and B) or CCRT alone (group C) for 3 cycles. This is followed by pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W for 17 cycles plus placebo (group A) or olaparib 300 mg BID (group B); or durvalumab 10 mg/kg Q2W for 26 cycles (group C). Randomization is stratified by disease stage (IIIA vs IIIB/IIIC), tumor histology (squamous vs nonsquamous), PD‐L1 tumor proportion score (≥50% vs < 50%) and region (East Asia vs North America/Western Europe/UK vs other). PFS (RECIST v1.1 by blinded independent central review [BICR]) and OS are dual primary endpoints. Secondary endpoints include ORR, duration of response, safety and tolerability, and quality of life (QoL). Tumor response will be evaluated per RECIST v1.1 by BICR at baseline, week 12, Q9W until year 2, Q12W until year 3, Q26W until year 5, and Q52W thereafter until disease progression, new cancer therapy, study withdrawal, or death. AEs will be graded by National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v5.0 and monitored during the study and for 30 days after the final dose (90 days for serious AEs). QoL outcomes will be assessed using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire‐Core 30 (EORTC QLQ‐C30) and the Lung Cancer Module (EORTC QLQ‐LC13).

abstract = {Stage III NSCLC comprises a very heterogeneous group of patients with regard to tumor extent, prognosis, and treatment options. It represents between 25‐30% of NSCLCs and the majority of them are unresectable. Potentially curative treatment of unresectable stage III necessitates adequate locoregional control as well as control of the micrometastatic disease that is likely to be present in most patients. Several randomized clinical trials dating back as far as 20 years and metanalysis have shown the superiority of cisplatin‐based chemotherapy and radiotherapy over radiotherapy alone. Sequential versus concomitant approach has been directly compared in several trials; almost all of them showed a trend in favor of concomitant treatment. These results clearly supported the use of concomitant chemoradiotherapy as standard of care for these patients1 fit enough to tolerate the risk of severe toxicity, particularly grade 3‐4 esophagitis that is the most common adverse effect of the concomitant approach. Attempts to improve outcomes have included studies of radiotherapy dose escalation and new chemotherapy combinations, as well as adding biological agents and cancer vaccines to existing regimens. Technical radiotherapy modifications, including intensity‐modulated radiotherapy and particle beam therapy, have also been investigated. In spite of it, the long‐term survival has remained largely unchanged for many years, with only 15% of patients are alive at 5 years. In the last years, immune‐checkpoints blockade revolutionized the standard of care of metastatic NSCLC. The PACIFIC study is an randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, multi‐centre, phase 3 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of durvalumab compared with placebo, as sequential therapy in patients with locally advanced, unresectable stage III NSCLC who have not progressed following definitive, concurrent platinum‐based chemotherapy and thoracic RT. The study was positive for both primary endpoints progression‐ free survival (HR=0.51; 95%CI: 0.41‐0.63)) and overall survival (HR=0.68; 95%CI: 0.49‐0.99; p=0.00251)2. This benefit was observed in both non‐squamous and squamous histology as well as in both stages IIIA and IIIB NSCLC. Based on this study, there is a new standard of care for unresectable stage III NSCLC patients. Nevertheless, improving outcomes for patients with stage III disease remains a challenge and many questions have to address in well‐designed clinical trials. 1.‐ Postmus PE, Kerr KM, Oudkerk M et al.

abstract = {Background: Historically, the standard‐of‐care for patients (pts) with unresectable stage III non‐small cell lung cancer(NSCLC) was concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT); however, outcomes are poor with 5‐y survival rates of 15‐30%. WhileCCRT primes anti‐tumour immunity, it also upregulates PD‐L1 expression, potentially blunting any immune response. Thus,concurrent immunotherapy + CCRT may improve outcomes. The safety and tolerability of nivolumab (NIVO), an anti‐PD‐1antibody, given concomitantly with CCRT in pts with stage III NSCLC was demonstrated in the phase 2 NICOLAS study(NCT02434081). Furthermore, combining NIVO with ipilimumab (IPI), an anti‐CTLA‐4 antibody, resulted in a longer medianoverall survival (OS) versus chemotherapy in pts with advanced NSCLC who had a PD‐L1 expression level of ≥ 1% in thephase 3 CheckMate 227 study (NCT02477826). In a prespecified exploratory analysis, NIVO + IPI showed an efficacybenefit versus NIVO. Previously, durvalumab (DURV), an anti‐PD‐L1 antibody, demonstrated significant improvementsversus placebo in progression‐free survival (PFS) and OS with manageable safety in pts without disease progression afterCCRT in the phase 3 PACIFIC study (NCT02125461). Therefore, we will evaluate the efficacy of NIVO + CCRT followed byNIVO ± IPI versus CCRT followed by DURV for untreated, locally advanced stage III NSCLC in the phase 3 randomizedCheckMate 73 L study (NCT04026412). Trial Design: In all, 888 pts aged ≥ 18 y with previously untreated stage III NSCLC and an ECOG PS ≤ 1 will be stratifiedby age, PD‐L1 expression, and disease stage, then randomized (1 : 1 : 1) to receive NIVO (360 mg Q3W) + CCRT followed byNIVO (360 mg Q3W) + IPI (1 mg/kg Q6W; Arm A) or NIVO alone (480 mg Q4W; Arm B) for ≤ 1 y, or CCRT followed byDURV (10 mg/kg Q2W; Arm C) for ≤ 1 y. Pts with progressive disease during CCRT will discontinue treatment and enterfollow‐up. Primary endpoints are PFS by RECIST 1.1, assessed by BICR (Arm A vs. C) and OS (Arm A vs. C). Secondaryendpoints are PFS (Arm B vs. A or C), OS (Arm B vs. A or C), objective response rate, time to response, duration ofresponse, time to distant metastases, and safety. Start date: Aug 2019.},

abstract = {Background: Pembrolizumab, an anti‐PD‐1 antibody is standard of care therapy for metastatic non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC) as monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy. Durvalumab, an anti‐PD‐L1 antibody, is approved for unresectable, stage III NSCLC without disease progression following concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CCRT). Early trials of pembrolizumab in combination with chemoradiotherapy, either concurrently or as consolidation, showed acceptable tolerability and promising PFS in patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC. Early data suggest the combination of poly(ADP‐ribose) polymerase (PARP) plus anti‐PD‐(L)1 inhibition can enhance treatment effects. KEYLYNK‐012 (NCT04380636) is evaluating pembrolizumab plus CCRT followed by pembrolizumab with/without the PARP inhibitor olaparib vs CCRT followed by durvalumab in patients with unresectable, locally advanced, stage III NSCLC. Methods: This global phase 3, randomized, placebo‐ and active‐controlled, double‐blind study is enrolling patients aged ≥18 y with previously untreated, pathologically confirmed, stage IIIA‐C NSCLC, an ECOG PS of 0 or 1, and a tumor sample available for PD‐L1 evaluation. Patients are randomized 1:1:1 to CCRT (platinum‐doublet chemotherapy [cisplatin plus pemetrexed or etoposide; or carboplatin plus paclitaxel] plus radiotherapy 60 Gy over 6 wks [cycles 2‐3]) with pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W (groups A and B) or CCRT alone (group C) for 3 cycles. This is followed by pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W for 17 cycles plus placebo (group A) or olaparib 300 mg BID (group B); or durvalumab 10 mg/kg Q2W for 26 cycles (group C). Randomization is stratified by disease stage (IIIA vs IIIB/IIIC), tumor histology (squamous vs nonsquamous), PD‐L1 tumor proportion score (≥50% vs < 50%) and region (East Asia vs North America/Western Europe/UK vs other). PFS (RECIST v1.1 by blinded independent central review [BICR]) and OS are dual primary endpoints. Secondary endpoints include ORR, duration of response, safety and tolerability, and quality‐of‐life outcomes. Tumor response will be evaluated per RECIST v1.1 by BICR after CCRT and at regular intervals throughout the study until disease progression, new cancer therapy, study withdrawal, or death. AEs will be graded by National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v5.0. Enrollment began July 6, 2020 and is ongoing at 204 sites in 24 countries.},

abstract = {Background: Atezolizumab is an antiePD‐L1 mAb that blocks PD‐L1 from interacting with its receptors PD‐1 and B7.1 and restores anticancer immunity. In patients with 2L/3L advanced NSCLC, the OAK trial showed improved mOS in the atezolizumab arm (13.8 mo) vs the docetaxel arm (9.6 mo), with survival benefit observed across all PD‐L1 expression levels on tumor cells (TC) or tumor‐infiltrating immune cells (IC). In patients with fully resected NSCLC (stages IB [tumors ≥ 4 cm]‐IIIA), adjuvant chemotherapy remains the standard of care, but survival benefit is limited. Therefore, more effective therapies are still needed for patients with early‐stage NSCLC. IMpower010 (NCT02486718) is a global Phase III, randomized, open‐label trial conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab vs best supportive care (BSC) following adjuvant cisplatinebased chemotherapy in patients with resected stage IB (tumors ≥ 4 cm)‐IIIA NSCLC. Method: Eligibility criteria include complete tumor resection 4‐12 weeks prior to enrollment for pathological stage IB (tumors ≥ 4 cm)‐IIIA NSCLC, adequate recovery from surgery, ability to receive cisplatinbased adjuvant chemotherapy and ECOG PS 0‐1. Patients with other malignancies, autoimmune disease, hormonal cancer or radiation therapy within 5 years and prior chemotherapy or immunotherapy will be excluded. Approximately 1127 patients will be enrolled regardless of PD‐L1 status. Patients will receive up to four 21‐day cycles of cisplatin‐based chemotherapy (cisplatin [75 mg/m2 IV, day 1] + vinorelbine [30 mg/m2 IV, days 1, 8], docetaxel [75 mg/m2 IV, day 1] or gemcitabine [1250 mg/m2 IV, days 1, 8], or pemetrexed [500 mg/m2 IV, day 1; only non‐squamous NSCLC]). Adjuvant radiation therapy is not permitted. Eligible patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive 16 cycles of atezolizumab 1200 mg q3w or BSC post‐adjuvant chemotherapy. Stratification factors include sex, histology (squamous vs nonsquamous), disease stage (IB vs II vs IIA) and PD‐L1 status by IHC (TC2/3 [≥ 5% expressing PD‐L1] and any IC vs TC0/1 [< 5%], and IC2/3 vs TC0/1 and IC0/1 [< 5%]). The primary endpoint is diseasefree survival, and secondary endpoints include OS and safety. Exploratory biomarkers will be evaluated, including PD‐L1 expression and immune‐ and tumor‐related biomarkers before, during and after treatment with atezolizumab and at radiographic disease recurrence or confirmation of new primary NSCLC. Result: Not applicable. Conclusion: Not applicable.},

abstract = {Purpose/Objective(s): Anti–PD‐(L)1‐directed therapy following radiotherapy or following concurrent chemoradiation is associated with significantly longer PFS and OS in patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC, including those with locally advanced inoperable tumors. KEYNOTE‐867 (NCT03924869) evaluates the efficacy and safety of SBRT with or without pembrolizumab in patients with unresected stage I or II NSCLC. Materials/Methods: In this phase 3, randomized, placebo‐controlled study, approximately 530 adult patients with previously untreated, unresected, histologically/cytologically confirmed stage I or II (T1 to limited T3, N0, M0) NSCLC are randomized 1:1 to receive thoracic SBRT to primary tumors for ≤2 wk (Table) and either pembrolizumab 200 mg or placebo every 3 wk for 17 cycles (approximately 1 year) or until disease recurrence, development of unacceptable AEs, SBRT not started for any reason, or study withdrawal. Randomization is stratified by disease stage (I vs II), ECOG PS (0 or 1 vs 2), geographic region (East Asia vs non‐East Asia), and reason for not receiving surgery (medically inoperable vs refused surgery). Imaging assessment by blinded independent central review (BICR) occurs at 12 wk (≥10 wk after SBRT completion), followed by every 16 wk for 3 y, and then every 6 mo. Primary endpoints are event‐free survival (EFS) by BICR and OS. Secondary endpoints include time to death or distant metastases and safety; exploratory endpoints are time to subsequent treatment, disease‐specific survival, and time to recurrence/progression on subsequent line of therapy. AEs are monitored throughout the trial until 30 d after last dose (90 for serious AEs) and graded according to NCI CTCAE version 4.0. EFS and OS are analyzed by the nonparametric Kaplan‐Meier method, treatment differences by stratified log‐rank test, and hazard ratios by stratified Cox proportional hazard model with Efron's method of tie handling. Enrollment started on June 17, 2019, and is ongoing at 169 sites in North America, South America, Europe, Asia and Australasia. Results: TBD Conclusion: TBD},

abstract = {Background: Immune checkpoint inhibitors have provided long‐lasting responses in recurrent non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, but the majority of patients do not benefit with response rates of < 25%. To test if stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) on a single metastasis preceding pembrolizumab, an anti PD‐1 antibody, is safe and will lead to an increased tumor specific immune response, we initiated the multicenter phase II PEMBRO‐RT study. Methods: Patients with advanced NSCLC with all histologies, second line or further, regardless of PD‐L1 status were randomized (1:1) between receiving iv. pembrolizumab (200mg q3w) alone or iv. pembrolizumab (200mg q3w) after SBRT (3x8Gy) on a single metastasis. Biopsies were taken from a non‐irradiated tumor site at baseline and after two cycles of pembrolizumab. The primary endpoint was an improvement of the overall response rate (ORR) from 20% to 50% at 12 weeks in the pembrolizumab alone vs the combination arm respectively. Results: From July 2015 to June 2016, 38 patients were randomized and 28 patients were evaluable for the primary endpoint: 13 in the pembrolizumab alone arm vs 15 patients in the combination arm. ORR at 12 weeks was 23.1% in the pembrolizumab alone arm vs 33.3% in the combination arm. In the pembrolizumab alone armthree patients had a confirmed partial response (PR); two had stable disease (SD) and eight showed progressive disease (PD). In the combination armfive patients had a confirmed PR; four had SD and six showedPD. There were no treatment related toxicities leading to discontinuation of the pembrolizumab and SBRT did not result in higher toxicity. Conclusion: SBRT on a single metastasis directly followed by pembrolizumab shows a promising ORR advantage in this preliminary analysis without an increase in toxicity.},

abstract = {Introduction: Selpercatinib (LOXO‐292) is a highly selective and potent inhibitor of RET signaling. In the LIBRETTO‐001 Phase I/II trial, selpercatinib treatment resulted in a 64% objective response rate (ORR) (95% confidence interval [CI]: 54‐73%) in the registration dataset (n=105) of patients with RET+ NSCLC who previously received platinum‐based chemotherapy and an 85% ORR (95% CI: 70‐94%) in treatment‐naïve patients with RET+ NSCLC (n=39). Although the duration of response (DOR) and progression free‐survival (PFS) were not yet mature in treatment‐naïve patients, in patients who previously received chemotherapy, the median DOR was 18 months (95% CI: 12‐not estimable [NE]), median PFS was 17.5 months (95% CI: 12‐NE), and CNS ORR per RECIST 1.1 was 91% (95% CI: 59‐100%) (n=10/11). The most common adverse reactions included dry mouth (39%), diarrhea (37%), hypertension (35%), and fatigue (35%). The majority of adverse reactions were Grade 1 or Grade 2. The most common lab abnormality was increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (51%)/aspartate transaminase (AST) (45%). A total of 5% of patients discontinued due to an adverse reaction. The LIBRETTO‐431 trial, is a global, open‐label, randomized, controlled, Phase 3 trial evaluating selpercatinib vs platinum‐based and pemetrexed treatment +/‐ pembrolizumab in treatment‐naïve patients with locally advanced or metastatic RET+ non‐squamous NSCLC (NCT04194944). Methods: Patients will be randomized to receive selpercatinib 160 mg BID in 3‐week cycles (Arm A) or pemetrexed (500 mg/m2 IV) in 3‐week cycles plus investigator’s choice of carboplatin (AUC 5) or cisplatin (75 mg/m2 IV) for 4 cycles (Arm B). For patients in Arm B, at the investigator’s discretion, pembrolizumab (200 mg IV) may also be given for up to 35 cycles and patients may receive maintenance pemetrexed +/‐ pembrolizumab. Crossover to selpercatinib is allowed for Arm B patients who have disease progression. Treatment will be discontinued for progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, decision to withdraw or death. Stratification factors include geography: East Asian versus non‐East Asian, brain metastases: presence versus absence, and intended treatment if randomized to Arm B: +/‐ pembrolizumab. RET status may be determined in tumor (by PCR or NGS) or in blood (by NGS) using a qualified local test or a Lilly‐enabled regional test. Key eligibility criteria include age ≥18 years; treatment‐naïve; non‐squamous Stage IIIB‐IIIC not suitable for surgery/radiation therapy or Stage IV NSCLC; measurable disease by RECIST 1.1; ECOG performance status 0‐2. Key exclusion criteria include presence of other known oncogenic drivers and symptomatic central nervous system metastases. Tumor assessments will be performed until progressive disease, the start of a new anticancer treatment, death or study completion. The co‐primary endpoint, PFS by independent review in intent‐to‐treat (ITT) patients with pembrolizumab (if assigned to control), will act as a gatekeeper to the co‐primary endpoint PFS by independent review in the ITT population. Secondary endpoints include investigator assessed PFS, ORR/DOR, intracranial ORR/DOR, overall survival, time to deterioration in pulmonary symptoms, progression after the next line of therapy, RET fusion status: local versus central, and safety/tolerability. The study was initiated in March 2020 and enrollment is ongoing. Keywords: RET Kinase Inhibitor, Trial in Progress, non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)},

abstract = {Importance: Standard of care for unresectable locally advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) involves definitive chemoradiotherapy followed by maintenance therapy with durvalumab. However, the cost of durvalumab has been cited as a barrier to its use in various health systems. Objective: To evaluate the cost‐effectiveness of durvalumab vs placebo as maintenance therapy in patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC from 4 international payer perspectives (US, Brazil, Singapore, and Spain). Design, Setting, and Participants: In this economic evaluation, a Markov model was designed to compare the lifetime cost‐effectiveness of maintenance durvalumab for unresectable stage III NSCLC with that of placebo, using 5‐year outcomes data from the PACIFIC randomized placebo‐controlled trial. Individual patient data were extracted from the PACIFIC, KEYNOTE‐189, ADAURA, ALEX, and REVEL randomized clinical trials to develop a decision‐analytic model to determine the cost‐effectiveness of durvalumab compared with placebo maintenance therapy over a 10‐year time horizon. Direct costs, adverse events, and patient characteristics were based on country‐specific payer perspectives and demographic characteristics. The study was conducted from June 1, 2022, through December 27, 2023. Main Outcomes and Measures: Life‐years, quality‐adjusted life years (QALYs), lifetime costs, and incremental cost‐effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were estimated at country‐specific willingness‐to‐pay thresholds ([data reported in US$] US: $150 000 per QALY; Brazil: $22 251 per QALY; Singapore: $55 288 per QALY, and Spain: $107 069 per QALY). One‐way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to account for parameters of uncertainty. A cost‐threshold analysis was also performed. Results: The US base‐case model found that treatment with durvalumab was associated with an increased cost of $114 394 and improved effectiveness of 0.50 QALYs compared with placebo, leading to an ICER of $228 788 per QALY. Incremental cost‐effectiveness ratios, according to base‐case models, were $141 146 for Brazil, $153 461 for Singapore, and $125 193 for Spain. Durvalumab price adjustments to the PACIFIC data improved cost‐effectiveness in Singapore, with an ICER of $45 164. The model was most sensitive to the utility of durvalumab. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cost‐effectiveness analysis of durvalumab as maintenance therapy for unresectable stage III NSCLC, the therapy was found to be cost‐prohibitive from the perspective of various international payers according to country‐specific willingness‐to‐pay thresholds per QALY. The findings of the study suggest that discounted durvalumab acquisition costs, as possible in Singapore, might improve cost‐effectiveness globally.},

abstract = {PURPOSE/OBJECTIVE(S): Synergy and abscopal phenomena have been observed with radiation and immunotherapy in pre‐clinical and early clinical studies. Nivolumab, a PD‐1 receptor antibody, improved overall survival in advanced NSCLC progressing after chemotherapy. We hypothesized that the addition of SABR might increase the activity of nivolumab. The aim of NIVORAD was to determine the activity and safety of treating a site of disease with a single fraction of SABR during therapy with nivolumab in advanced NSCLC progressing after 1 or 2 lines of chemotherapy. MATERIALS/METHODS: Adults with metastatic NSCLC progressing after 1 or 2 lines of chemotherapy and a disease site suitable for SABR were randomly assigned (2:1) to either nivolumab 240mg 2‐weekly until disease progression or prohibitive toxicity given together with a single fraction of SABR (18‐20 Gy on day 8‐14 of cycle 1); or, the same regimen of nivolumab without SABR. The primary endpoint was progression‐free survival (PFS) at 6 months. Secondary endpoints included objective tumor response rate (OTRR), overall survival (OS), PFS at 1 year and 2 years, and adverse events (AEs). The planned sample size of 120 provided 80% power with a 1‐sided type 1 error rate of 5% to distinguish the observed proportions alive and progression free at 6 months from benchmarks of 50% (worthy of pursuit) versus 35%. The study was closed early because of slow accrual. RESULTS: Fifty of the planned 120 participants were recruited from MAR2017 to JUN2019 (median age 66 years; male 58%; ECOG PS 0 32%, PS 1 68%; current smoker 30%) and randomly assigned to either nivolumab plus SABR (n = 34) or nivolumab alone (n = 16). Median follow‐up was 25 months. PFS was similar among those assigned nivolumab plus SABR versus nivolumab alone (HR = 0.82, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.54, P = 0.6; PFS at 6mo 44% vs 43%, at 1y 27% vs 19%, and at 2y 16% vs 6%, respectively). OTRR (8/34 [24%] vs 4/16 [25%]) and OS (HR 0.94, P = 0.9) were also similar in the two treatment groups, as were the numbers of participants with grade 3‐4 AEs: 24/30 (80%) vs 12/16 (75%) respectively. There were no treatment‐related deaths in either arm. CONCLUSION: Nivolumab plus SABR demonstrated similar activity and safety to nivolumab alone in NSCLC progressing after 1 or 2 lines of chemotherapy, with a potential signal of long‐term efficacy, although the study was underpowered to detect this. Research should focus on identifying more active regimens of SABR and immunotherapy worthy of further evaluation.},

abstract = {Background: Interim analysis of the open‐label phase 3 RATIONALE‐304 study (NCT03663205) demonstrated clinical benefit of tislelizumab (TIS) plus chemotherapy (chemo) as first‐line (1L) therapy in patients with advanced nsq‐NSCLC vs chemo alone, with significantly improved progression‐free survival (PFS) and a manageable safety profile. Here, we report the updated results. Methods: Adults with treatment‐naive, stage IIIB (not amenable to curative surgery/radiotherapy)/IV nsq‐NSCLC were randomized (2:1) to receive platinum (carboplatin or cisplatin) and pemetrexed (PEM) every 3 weeks either with TIS (Arm A) or without (Arm B), followed by maintenance TIS + PEM (Arm A) or PEM (Arm B). The primary endpoint was PFS in Arm A vs Arm B, per independent review committee (IRC). Secondary endpoints included overall survival, objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DoR), and safety. Results: As of 15 July 2022, the median PFS per IRC was 9.8 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.9, 11.7) vs 7.6 (95% CI: 5.4, 8.0) months (mo) in Arm A vs Arm B, respectively (stratified hazard ratio 0.61 [95% CI: 0.46, 0.82]). ORR was greater in Arm A (51.6% [95% CI: 44.8, 58.3]) vs Arm B (27.9% [95% CI: 19.8, 37.2]) and median DoR was longer (14.5 [95% CI: 10.1, 24.4] vs 8.4 [95% CI: 6.0, 15.5] mo, respectively). TIS plus chemo was tolerable with no new safety signals identified after longer follow‐up. The incidences of ≥grade 3 treatment‐emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and of TEAEs leading to death (including disease progression‐related AEs) in Arm A and Arm B were 69.4% and 56.4%, and 4.1% and 1.8%, respectively. Conclusions: In RATIONALE‐304, the addition of TIS to platinum plus PEM continued to demonstrate favorable efficacy and was generally well tolerated as 1L treatment of advanced nsq‐NSCLC vs chemo alone, with no new safety signals identified.

Nivolumab (240mg) will be administered as an intravenous infusion every 2 weeks until disease progression or prohibitive toxicity. SABR (18‐20 Gy) will be administered to a single lesion between days 8 ‐ 14 of cycle 1 of Nivolumab. The specific day of SABR will be at clinical discretion of the treating radiation oncologist. Participants will receive 1 or 2 fractions of SABR, dependent on tumour location, determined by clinical discretion of the treating radiologist. Each SABR treatment will take approximately 1 hour. CONDITION: Advanced non‐small cell lung cancer, progressing after first of second line chemotherapy PRIMARY OUTCOME: Progression free survival (PFS) at 6 months (RECIST 1.1) SECONDARY OUTCOME: Adverse events (CTCAE v4.03 and RTOG/EORTC RMSS) Objective tumour response rate (OTRR, RECIST 1.1) Overall survival (OS) at 1 year and 2 years ; Overall Survival will be measured as the interval from the date of randomisation to the date of death from any cause. ; ; Progression Free Survival (PFS) at 1 year and 2 years. ; Progression Free Survival will be measured at the interval between the date of randomisation until the date that disease progression is first observed, or the date of death from any cause, whichever occurs first. Disease progression will be determined by a comparing imaging (scans) of documented disease prior to treatment to the first positive scan following study treatment. Tertiary studies aim to identify predictive biomarkers that will allow us to select patients most likely to respond to, and derive benefit from this treatment as well as the presence of other biomarkers whose presence may be indicative of better or worse longer term outcomes such as survival. These may include biomarkers which are often studied amongst patients with non‐small cell lung cancer such as PD‐L1 expression, EGFR and KRAS mutational status but also novel biomarkers relating to effects of radiation on the immune response. INCLUSION CRITERIA: 1. Adult (18 years or over) with a histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of NSCLC. 2. At least one site of metastasis which is suitable for stereotactic radiotherapy, but for which radiotherapy is not urgently required at the time of enrollment. This must be outside of BOTH the thorax, and the central nervous system, and must not have been previously irradiated. The lesion/s is not required to be measurable or evaluable and must be nominated before randomisation. This lesion will be irradiated in patients randomised to receive radiation. 3. At least one lesion (target or non‐target according to RECIST 1.1) that is separate and in addition to the lesion nominated for irradiation. This lesion cannot have been irradiated previously. 4. Must have relapsed after receiving 1 or 2 lines of chemotherapy for advanced disease including a platinum‐based doublet.

abstract = {Background: Gangliosides, especially NeuGc‐GM3, are attractive targets for cancer immunotherapy. They are not expressed in normal human cells but are overexpressed and involved in tumor growth in several tumors (melanoma, neuroectodermal pediatric tumors and breast cancer). More than 70% of non‐small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) express NeuGc‐GM3. Racotumomab is an anti‐idiotypic monoclonal antibody that mimics NeuGc gangliosides. Administered as a therapeutic vaccine it acts as an antigen, inducing a cellular and humoral immune response against NeuGc‐GM3 and other gangliosides. Previous trials have shown its low toxicity and high immunogenicity. Recently, a multicenter, randomized, placebo controlled, double‐blind trial in 176 NSCLC (IIIB and IV) patients with at least stable disease after first line therapy and progression free at inclusion showed a statistical significant survival benefit in favor of racotumomab. Methods: This phase III, multinational, randomized (1:1), open label trial will evaluate efficacy and safety of racotumomab plus best supportive care (BSC) versus BSC. 1,082 patients with NSCLC (stages III or IV) showing response or stable disease after standard first‐line therapy (platinum‐based chemotherapy and radiotherapy) are eligible if they remain free of progression and have a PS 1. Vaccination consists of an induction period (5 doses, 1 every 14 days) followed by a maintenance period (1 dose every 28 days, until worsening of the PS or unacceptable toxicity occur). Upon progression other onco‐specific therapies may be used and vaccination can continue. Overall survival (OS) will be compared using a two‐sided log rank test at a significance level (alpha) of 0.05 with 90% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.79. There will be 3 interim analyses and a final analysis when 758 deaths occur. So far 190 patients have been randomized. An Independent Data Monitoring Committee oversees the study and has so far (last meeting September 2012) concluded that the trial can continue.},

abstract = {Background: Anti‐PD‐(L)1‐directed therapy following radiotherapy or following concurrent chemoradiation is associated with significantly longer PFS and OS in patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC, including those with locally advanced inoperable tumors. KEYNOTE‐867 (NCT03924869) evaluates the efficacy and safety of SBRT with or without pembrolizumab in patients with unresected stage I or II NSCLC. Methods: In this phase 3, randomized, placebo‐controlled study, approximately 530 adult patients with previously untreated, unresected, histologically/cytologically confirmed stage I or II (T1 to limited T3, N0, M0) NSCLC are randomized 1:1 to receive thoracic SBRT to primary tumors for ≤2 wk (Table) and either pembrolizumab 200 mg or placebo every 3 wk for 17 cycles (approximately 1 year) or until disease recurrence, development of unacceptable AEs, SBRT not started for any reason, or study withdrawal. Randomization is stratified by disease stage (I vs II), ECOG PS (0 or 1 vs 2), geographic region (East Asia vs non‐East Asia), and reason for not receiving surgery (medically inoperable vs refused surgery). Imaging assessment by blinded independent central review (BICR) occurs at 12 wk (≥10 wk after SBRT completion), followed by every 16 wk for 3 y, and then every 6 mo. Primary endpoints are event‐free survival (EFS) by BICR and OS. Secondary endpoints include time to death or distant metastases and safety; exploratory endpoints are time to subsequent treatment, disease‐specific survival, and time to recurrence/progression on subsequent line of therapy. AEs are monitored throughout the trial until 30 d after last dose (90 for serious AEs) and graded according to NCI CTCAE version 4.0. EFS and OS are analyzed by the nonparametric Kaplan‐Meier method, treatment differences by stratified log‐rank test, and hazard ratios by stratified Cox proportional hazard model with Efron's method of tie handling. Enrollment started on June 17, 2019, and is ongoing at 168 sites around the world.},

abstract = {Background: The PACIFIC trial has demonstrated that durable progression free survival (PFS) and sustained overall survival (OS) benefit with durvalumab as consolidation therapy after concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CCRT). In a subgroup analysis, the effect was not proven in patients with EGFR mutation positive. There is an unmet need for consolidative therapy after CCRT in patients with unresectable stage III EGFR mutation positive. A recent ADAURA trial showed that osimertinib had a significant prolongation of PFS in the postoperative adjuvant treatment in EGFR mutation positive patients. Lazertinib is also 3rd generation EGFR TKI as osimertinib and shows good anti‐cancer effect in EGFR sensitive mutations in preclinical data. And Lazertinib showed promising clinical activity in patients with NSCLC progressing after EGFR TKI therapy. Given these positive 3rd G EGFR TKI data in the adjuvant setting, and the preliminary data obtained in EGFR TKI therapies in the early disease setting, there is a strong rationale to suggest that Lazertinib may provide clinical benefit in the consolidative treatment after CCRT treatment. Trial design: This study is a phase II, multicenter study assessing the efficacy and safety of Lazertinib as consolidation therapy in patients with locally advanced, unresectable NSCLC (Stage III) who have not progressed following definitive, platinum based, CCRT. Approximately 77 patients will be enrolled. The patients who have sensitizing EGFR mutation (e.g., exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R mutation) will be enrolled. Administration of Lazertinib will commence 1 to 42 days after the patients had received chemoradiotherapy and will continue a q4w schedule until clinical progression, confirmed radiological progression, initiation of alternative cancer therapy, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or other reasons to discontinue study treatment occur. The primary end point is PFS and 2ndary end points are OS, the objective response rate, the duration of response, the time to death or distant metastasis, and safety.

abstract = {1. Background Esophageal cancer, the 7th most common cancer globally, accounts for more than half a million deaths each year. The incidence of ESCC, the most common histologic type, has been stable, whereas the incidences of esophageal and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinomas continue to increase in Western countries. Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery has become a standard of care for patients with locally advanced resectable esophageal or junctional cancer, especially in western countries. In Asia (especially Japan), nCT is considered as the standard of care for Stage II/III ESCC based on JCOG9204 and JCOG9907 trials. The superiority of nCRT/nCT, in terms of long‐term survival, remains to be elucidated. For Stage II/III ESCC patients with multiple stations of lymph nodes involvement, nCT might be more appropriate for the inaccessibility of radiotherapy. There are only limited studies on preoperative immune checkpoint inhibitor in combination with chemotherapy followed by surgery for the locally advanced ESCC. Therefore, this study intends to use Nivolumab 360 mg Q3W combined with standard chemotherapy as the neoadjuvant therapy regimen. 2. Sample Size The planned sample size is approximately 81 subjects. The sample size calculations are based on the results of neoadjuvant therapy clinical research in our center (Department of Thoracic Surgery, Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Fudan University). In the past two years, about 85% of patients can undergo surgery and complete the entire treatment plan, combining with the results of neoadjuvant immunotherapy in lung cancer. As calculated based on an asymptotic method, 81 patients will be 2:1 randomized to Nivolumab/Chemo and Chemo group, with 80% power to detect a 21% difference in the proportion of patients achieving a pCR at a one‐sided α of 0.05, assuming a pCR rate of 25% in the Nivolumab/Chemo group and 4% in the Chemo group. Considering a 10% drop rate, 90 patients will be enrolled. 10‐20 more subjects may be added to each group after the evaluation of feasibility and safety as the justification. 3. Research Process 3.1 Screening period 1) Tumor evaluation, including CT/MRI, PET/CT, endoscopy and pathological evaluation should be performed within 14 days before enrollment. 2) The following assessments should be performed within 14 days before enrollment: demographic data, concomitant diseases/treatment, full physical examination (including vital signs, KPS score, height, weight, and physical examination of the nervous system ), laboratory tests (blood routine / biochemical, fecal routine + occult blood, urine routine, coagulation function, tumor markers, thyroid function, hepatitis B and C markers, myocardial enzyme spectrum, T‐SPOT, HIV antibodies), electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiography, and pregnancy tests (for all women with menopause less than 12 months). 3) Pulmonary function tests will be performed on patients suspected or known to have severe respiratory disease or have significant respiratory symptoms unrelated to underlying cancer, including but not limited to spirometry tests and assessment of lung dispersion during the screening period to help determine if it is appropriate to participate in this study. 4) After the completion of all screening items, the researcher must review the results/data, and the subjects can only be enrolled after passing the review. 5) Subjects are required to obtain written informed consent to participate in any specific research steps. (See table below) 3.2 Treatment period Baseline assessment 1. The baseline check is performed within 7 days after signing the informed consent, and treatment must be performed within 7 days after enrollment. 2. Make the following assessments within 1 week before treatment: vital signs (temperature, blood pressure, heart rate), physical examination (including PS score, height, weight, physical examination of each system), blood routine / biochemical examination (including creatinine clearance Calculation), coagulation function, fecal routine and occult blood, urine routine and pregnancy test, tumor markers, thyroid function, hepatitis B and C markers, myocardial enzyme spectrum, T‐SPOT, HIV antibodies, ECG, cardiac ultrasound, lung function. 3. When performing routine blood / biochemical examination, take 10ml blood samples for ctDNA, TCR‐Seq and other analysis, and if necessary, take tissue samples for further experiments. 4. According to the above schedule, if there are already laboratory tests in the screening period, the auxiliary tests can be used as a baseline within 7 days before the start of neoadjuvant therapy, and there is no need to repeat the tests. 5. Take the chest CT, PET/CT and endoscopy as the baseline for tumor evaluation during the screening period. After completing all screening activities and baseline assessments, eligible patients identified by the sponsor will be treated with medications, and treatment options will not be allowed to change during the study. After the investigator's first evaluation of disease progression based on RECIST, treatment can be continued if there is evidence of "pseudoprogression" and the consent of the sponsor and the patient's signing of the consent form again. Safety will be assessed throughout the study by monitoring AE / SAE (toxicity grades are assigned according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Criteria for Adverse Events Terminology [NCI‐CTCAE] version 5.0) and laboratory results. Vital signs, physical examination, changes in ECOG score, ECG results, and other tests will also be used for safety assessment. 3.3 Follow‐up period after study treatment 1. Follow up at the prescribed time (recommended physical examination, tumor markers, chest CT and PET/CT). If the patient has signs of recurrence (such as related clinical manifestations), additional tumor evaluations are performed during the treatment; possible reoperations and/or further cancer treatments are also documented. 2. During the follow‐up period without tumor recurrence, other cytotoxic agents are not allowed. 3. Inspection can be performed within ± 4 weeks of the specified date. 4. Patient recurrence and survival will be followed up to the patient's death, the last date on which the patient is known to survive, or 1 year after the primary effectiveness analysis. 4.Adverse Effect 4.1SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT COLLECTION AND REPORTING All Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) that occur following the subject's written consent to participate in the study through 100 days of discontinuation of dosing must be reported to BMS Worldwide Safety, whether related or not related to study drug. If applicable, SAEs must be collected that relate to any follow‐up protocol‐specified procedure (eg, a follow‐up skin biopsy). 4.2 NON‐SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT COLLECTION AND REPORTING The collection of non‐serious AE information should begin following the subject's written consent to participate in the study. All non serious adverse events (not only those deemed to be treatment‐related) should be collected continuously during the treatment period and for a minimum of 100 days following the last dose of study treatment. Non‐serious AEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization, or reported as SAEs if they become serious. Follow‐up is also required for non‐serious AEs that cause interruption or discontinuation of study drug and for those present at the end of study treatment as appropriate. Non‐serious Adverse Events (AE) are to be provided to BMS in aggregate via interim or final study reports as specified in the agreement or, if a regulatory requirement [eg, IND US trial] as part of an annual reporting requirement. 4.3 LABORATORY TEST ABNORMALITIES All laboratory test results captured as part of the study should be recorded following institutional procedures. Test results that constitute SAEs should be documented and reported to BMS as such. The following laboratory abnormalities should be documented and reported appropriately: any laboratory test result that is clinically significant or meets the definition of an SAE any laboratory abnormality that required the participant to have study drug discontinued or interrupted any laboratory abnormality that required the subject to receive specific corrective therapy. 4.4 OTHER SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS Any significant worsening noted during interim or final physical examinations, electrocardiograms, X‐rays, and any other potential safety assessments, whether or not these procedures are required by the protocol, should also be recorded as a non‐serious or serious AE, as appropriate, and reported accordingly. 5. Statistical analysis of research data 5.1 Statistical software All statistical analysis will be calculated using SPSS 24.0 statistical analysis software programming. 5.2 Descriptive statistics Continuous data: number of cases (number of missing cases), mean, median, standard deviation, P25, P75, minimum and maximum; Categorical data: frequency and the corresponding percentages. For primary safety endpoint, calculate the 95% CI in addition to the percentage. 5.3 Statistic inference All statistical tests are two‐sided. P values less than 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. The confidence interval (CI) is 95%. Statistical analysis for primary endpoint: pCR rates will be calculated as the proportions of the subjects in the analysis population who have a complete response in postoperative pathology. Statistical analysis for baseline variables and secondary endpoints: the 3‐year OS rates in the two treatment arms will be calculated by the Kaplan‐Meier method and compared by the log rank test. The Cox proportional hazard model will be used to evaluate the survival‐independent factors. Continuous variables were examined by independent sample t‐test or Wilcoxon rank‐sum test, and categorical variables were compared by Pearson chi‐square test, Fisher's exact test or CMH chi‐square test as appropriate. 5.4 Analysis of withdraw patients The number of patients who are enrolled, withdrawn, removed, completed, and number of every analysis set will be listed. 6. Research‐Related Ethics 6.1 Local regulations / Helsinki Declaration Researchers should ensure that the implementation of this research is in full compliance with the principles of the Helsinki Declaration or the law of the country in the country, regardless of the country's provisions on the protection of human rights. The research must strictly follow the "ICH guideline for Good Clinical Practice" ICH Tripartite Guideline (January 1997), or local law, whichever is more stringent. 6.2 Review by Ethics Committee This protocol, written informed consent, and data directly related to the subject must be submitted to the ethics committee, and formal research can only be conducted after obtaining written approval from the ethics committee. The researcher must submit an annual research report to the Ethics Committee at least annually (if applicable).

abstract = {Purpose/Objective(s): Anti–PD‐(L)1‐directed therapy following radiotherapy or following concurrent chemoradiation is associated with significantly longer PFS and OS in patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC, including those with locally advanced inoperable tumors. KEYNOTE‐867 (NCT03924869) evaluates the efficacy and safety of SBRT with or without pembrolizumab in patients with inoperable stage I/IIA NSCLC. Materials/Methods: In this phase 3, randomized, placebo‐controlled study, approximately 530 adult patients with previously untreated, medically inoperable, histologically/cytologically confirmed stage I/IIA NSCLC are randomized 1:1 to receive thoracic SBRT to primary tumors for ≤2 wk (Table) and either pembrolizumab 200 mg or placebo every 3 wk for 17 cycles (approximately 1 year) or until disease recurrence, development of unacceptable AEs, SBRT not started for any reason, or study withdrawal. Randomization is stratified by disease stage (I/IIA), ECOG PS (0–1/2), and geographic region (East Asia/other). Imaging assessment by blinded independent central review (BICR) occurs at 12 wk (≥10 wk after SBRT completion), followed by every 16 wk for 3 y, and then every 6 mo. Primary endpoints are event‐free survival (EFS) by BICR and OS. Secondary endpoints include time to death or distant metastases and safety; exploratory endpoints are time to subsequent treatment, disease‐specific survival, and time to recurrence/progression on subsequent line of therapy. AEs are monitored throughout the trial until 30 d after last dose (90 for serious AEs) and graded according to NCI CTCAE version 4.0. EFS and OS are analyzed by the nonparametric Kaplan‐Meier method, treatment differences by stratified log‐rank test, and hazard ratios by stratified Cox proportional hazard model with Efron's method of tie handling. Results: Enrollment started on June 17, 2019, at 131 sites, including sites within the United States, Canada, Europe, Asia, South America, Russia, Australia, and New Zealand. Conclusion: KEYNOTE‐867 will provide important information on the efficacy and safety of SRBT with or without pembrolizumab in patients with inoperable stage I/IIA NSCLC. [Formula presented]},

abstract = {Implementation of biomarker testing and enabling access to novel therapies have significantly prolonged overall survival (OS) in stage IV non‐ small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the standard of care for the past two decades for patients with stage IB‐IIIA surgically resected tumors has remained four cycles of cisplatin‐based adjuvant chemotherapy, with a survival benefit of 5% at 5 years. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy confers OS benefit over surgery alone, although there has been no robust head‐to‐head comparison with adjuvant chemotherapy. Encouraged by the success of a biomarker‐driven approach in advanced NSCLC and recognising the need to improve survival outcomes in early‐stage NSCLC, the interest in revisiting perioperative strategies is rising. Adjuvant treatment There are pros and cons to adjuvant therapies. There is no delay of surgery, no risk of disease progression resulting in missing opportunities to use curative surgery, and therapeutic decisions are guided by biomarkers. However, patients require longer treatment, there are no intermediate end points, biomarkers are less predictive, and long‐term follow‐up is needed to detect disease‐free survival (DFS) and OS. Results from the multicenter IMpower010 trial established PD‐L1 inhibitor atezolizumab as a potential new standard of care in adjuvant treatment. Updated findings published in 2021 showed that, compared with best supportive care, atezolizumab given for 1 year reduced the risk for disease recurrence or death by 34% in patients with stage II/IIIA NSCLC with PD‐L1 expression ≥ 1% and by 21% in all patients in the stage II/IIIA following surgery and chemotherapy. Preliminary results from the phase 3 KEYNOTE‐091 trial show that adjuvant pembrolizumab given for 1 year led to a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in DFS vs placebo in patients with stage IB/IIIA NSCLC following resection regardless of PD‐L1 expression. At the interim analysis, there was also an improvement in DFS for patients with PD‐L1≥50% in favor of pembrolizumab. KEYNOTE‐091 appears to provide a second trial supporting the use of adjuvant PD‐L1 inhibition in early‐stage disease. The ANVIL trial (adjuvant nivolumab) has been completed but the data are still not available. Many phase 3 trials investigating adjuvant immunotherapy (BR31, CANOPY‐A) and chemoimmunotherapy (ALCHEMIST, MERMAID‐1) are ongoing. In the field of targeted adjuvant treatment, updated data of the pivotal phase 3 ADAURA trial that established neoadjuvant osimertinib in patients with resected, EGFR‐ mutated, stage IB‐IIIA NSCLC showed that osimertinib reduced the risk for CNS death or progression by 82% in this patient population. ADAURA has many limitations, for example, in the adjuvant setting, it is not known whether the 2‐year DFS superiority with EGFR directed therapy will translate into an OS benefit with osimertinib, so the ALCHEMIST trial is currently testing adjuvant EGFR‐ and ALK‐directed therapy using OS as the primary endpoint. Neoadjuvant treatment Neoadjuvant systemic therapy can lead to early eradication of micrometastatic disease, guide the choice of or need for adjuvant therapy; early treatment is better tolerated and induces fewer toxicities. There's somewhat earlier trial endpoints, not in terms of OS or DFS but in terms of potential predictive and prognostic biomarkers. However, neoadjuvant therapy delays surgery, which could increase the risk for surgical complications. Further, there is an increased risk for disease progression, which could result in missing the opportunity for curative surgery. The immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are the interesting treatment option in neoadjuvant therapy of NSCLC due to the fact that early‐stage tumors have a greater host immunity fitness and lower clonal heterogeneity, which is the basis for achieving better major pathologic response (MPR) rates with ICIs than neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone. Most initial studies with neoadjuvant immunotherapy selected MPR, pathologic complete response (pCR) and event‐ free survival (EFS) as primary or secondary endpoints, leading to a significant reduction in the time and cost of research and development compared with the use of OS and median survival time as endpoints. Other benefits of neoadjuvant immunotherapy are chronic effects on survival and potential synergetic effects with chemotherapy. Early, but promising results from the phase 3 CheckMate 816 trial which investigated neoadjuvant nivolumab plus chemotherapy for 3 cycles compared to chemotherapy alone for patients with resectable stage IB to IIIA NSCLC were presented in 2021. Nivolumab plus chemotherapy yielded significant improvement in pCR in the intent‐to‐treat population (24.0% vs 2.2% with chemotherapy alone) and at all disease stages. Surgical outcomes and EFS favoured the chemoimmunotherapy combination as well. To confirm these benefits, many phase III clinical trials are being conducted, and there is a growing demand for research on related issues, including the patient selection, optimization of chemoimmunotherapy regimens, influence of treatment on the safety of surgery, standardization of radiological response and pathologic evaluation and ways to identify pseudoprogression and avoid resultant misjudgment in surgery and adjuvant therapy Since 2019, studies have introduced stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) before surgery in earlystage disease as safe and feasible approach. Coupled with encouraging data from neoadjuvant immunotherapy and the success of radioimmunotherapy approaches, ongoing studies are combining SBRT and immunotherapy in early‐stage disease. Early results are promising, showing high rates of MPR, but highlighting the need for careful patient selection and further studies in larger cohorts. There have been a number of targeted agents explored so far in the neoadjuvant setting, and have demonstrated trends toward improvements in pathologic response rates, mostly in the EGFR‐mutated population. Updated findings from a phase 2 trial that evaluated osimertinib given for 1‐2 cycles prior to surgery showed an induced pCR rate of 69% in patients with resectable EGFRmt NSCLC. The phase 3 NeoADAURA study is currently evaluating 9 weeks of neoadjuvant osimertinib, chemotherapy and their combination in patients with EGFRmt NSCLC. There are ongoing studies in other molecular subsets (eg, the ALINA trial in ALK rearranged NSCLC, NAUTIKA1 in multiple genomic alterations). Conclusion: The most effective treatment strategy for early stages of NSCLC remains unclear. With further standardisation of trial endpoints across studies, coupled with the implementation of novel tech nologies including radiomics and digital pathology, individual risk‐stratified neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment approaches are poised to make a striking impact on the outcomes of early‐stage NSCLC.},

abstract = {Objectives: To evaluate the clinical value of radiotherapy combined with Camrelizumab in treating locally advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Methods: 80 locally advanced NSCLC patients were randomly divided into two groups (n=40). The control group was administered with intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), whereas the experimental group with Camrelizumab in addition to IMRT. All the patients underwent clinical efficacy evaluation in terms of adverse drug reaction (ADR), physical status improvement after the treatment, and changes in T lymphocyte subpopulations (incl. CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD4+/CD8+). Results: The efficacy was found to be 70% and 47.5 in experimental group and control group, respectively, with the former being significantly better than the latter (p=0.03). The ADR rates were 50% and 37.5% in the experimental group and control group, respectively; but the difference remained insignificant (p=0.26). As for physical status improvement, experimental group evidently excelled the control group (p=0.04). The post‐treatment indicators such as CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD4+/CD8+ were significantly more improved in the experimental group than the control group (CD3+, p=0.02; CD4+, p=0.00; and CD4+/CD8+, p=0.01). However, the changes in CD8+ were not significant at all (p=0.46). Conclusions: The combined therapy of IMRT with Camrelizumab appeared effective in dealing with the locally advanced NSCLC patients, as such patients presented significantly better immune state and physical status improvement but not increased ADR. The therapy is both safe and effective.},

abstract = {Background: Thirty percent of patients with non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) present with Stage III disease. Concurrent chemoradiation therapy with curative intent is the treatment of choice for these patients. Despite treatment, progression‐free survival (PFS) is usually short (approximately 9 months) and most patients ultimately die of metastatic disease. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy have been shown to up‐regulate the expression of programmed cell‐death ligand 1 (PD‐L1), an important inhibitory checkpoint used by tumour cells to evade antitumour immune responses. MEDI4736 is a human IgG1 antibody that blocks PD‐L1 binding to programmed cell‐death 1 and CD80 and is engineered to prevent antibody dependent cell‐mediated cytotoxicity. In a Phase 1 study, MEDI4736 has shown an encouraging safety profile and clinical activity in multiple tumour types, including NSCLC. Here we describe the PACIFIC study, which evaluates the efficacy and safety ofMEDI4736 as sequential therapy in patients with locally advanced, unresectable NSCLC (Stage III) who have not progressed following definitive, platinum‐based, concurrent chemoradiation therapy. Trial design: In this phase 3, double‐blind, international study (NCT02125461) patients will be randomised (2:1) to MEDI4736 (10 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks) or matching placebo for up to 12 months. Patients must have received at least 2 cycles of platinum‐based chemotherapy concurrent with radiation therapy prior to randomisation. The primary objective is to assess the efficacy of MEDI4736 versus placebo in terms of overall survival and PFS (RECIST 1.1). Secondary outcome measures will assess efficacy (including proportion of patients alive at 24 months and objective response rate), safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity of MEDI4736 and its effect on symptoms and health‐related quality of life. An independent data monitoring committee is in place to monitor safety. Recruitment is ongoing at sites across Australia, Asia, Europe, North and South America and South Africa.},

abstract = {Introduction: There are approximately 35,000 cases of stage I lung cancer in the United States each year. While these patients have better 5‐year overall survival (OS) rates than their counterparts with locally advanced and metastatic disease, there is still considerable room for improvement. Based on a recent publication validating the 8th edition of the TNM classification, the 5‐year OS for node‐negative pathologically‐staged NSCLC between 1‐4cm ranges from 73‐86%, and recurrence rates for resected stage I NSCLC can range from 18‐38%. Previous studies looking at adjuvant chemotherapy in this setting have shown no benefit for stage IA tumors, and the current standard of care is observation alone. Checkpoint blockade with PD‐1/PD‐L1 inhibitors has shown considerable activity in NSCLC including in metastatic disease, as consolidation in stage III disease after chemoradiation, and in studies evaluating neoadjuvant immunotherapy. Given this activity and their favorable safety profile, we designed a study of adjuvant PD‐1 inhibition following resection in stage I NSCLC. Methods: This study is a randomized phase II multicenter trial of adjuvant Pembrolizumab versus observation alone following complete resection of stage I NSCLC with tumors between 1‐4cm. The trial will enroll 368 patients randomized 1:1 to either Pembrolizumab 200mg IV every 3 weeks for up to 17 cycles or observation alone with scheduled CT scans and routine clinical follow‐up. Stratification factors include PD‐L1 TPS ≥50% vs. <50% and tumor size of 1‐2cm vs. >2‐4cm. The sample size is based on the hypothesis that adjuvant Pembrolizumab will increase 3‐year disease free survival (DFS) from 75% to 84.15% (HR=0.6) with a power of 80% and a type I error of 0.1. The lead site is Indiana University, and the trial will be conducted through the Big Ten Cancer Research Consortium. The primary endpoint is DFS, and secondary endpoints include OS, DFS at 1‐, 2‐, and 3‐year time points, and toxicity. The trial opened to accrual at the lead site in May 2020, and there are currently 2 patients enrolled. [Formula presented] Results: Conclusion Keywords: Adjuvant, Immunotherapy, NSCLC},

abstract = {Background: On the basis of the PACIFIC trial, the standard of care for unresectable stage III non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is chemoradiotherapy (CRT) followed by 1 year of durvalumab consolidation therapy. Although CRT with platinum doublet is standard, low‐dose carboplatin (CBDCA) is widely used in Japan for patients who are not eligible for platinum‐based doublet chemotherapy. However, because only five patients received low‐dose CBDCA in the PACIFIC study, the efficacy of durvalumab after CRT with low‐dose CBDCA remains unclear. Methods: We evaluated patients who received low‐dose CBDCA‐based chemoradiotherapy for unresectable stage III NSCLC at the National Cancer Center Hospital between December 2007 and January 2021. The patients were divided into the following two groups: patients who received durvalumab after CRT (Durvalumab group) and those who received CRT alone (CRT alone group). We compared clinical outcomes between the two groups. Results: Of the 481 patients treated with CRT for stage III NSCLC, 56 received chemoradiotherapy with low‐dose CBDCA. The median age was 77 years (range: 67‐86 years). Twenty‐one patients received durvalumab after CRT, and thirty‐five patients did not. The median follow‐up time was 19.1 months in the Durvalumab group and 27.8 months in the CRT alone group. Median progression‐free survival was significantly longer in the Durvalumab group than in the CRT alone group (not reached vs. 12.9 months; p = 0.009). In the Durvalumab group, only 29% of patients (6/21) completed 1 year of treatment with durvalumab, and 13 patients (62%) discontinued durvalumab within 1 year. The reasons for discontinuation were disease progression in six cases and adverse events in seven cases (non‐infectious pneumonia in five cases, fatigue and myositis in one case, each). Conclusion: Durvalumab consolidation therapy after CRT can have benefit in patients with stage III NSCLC who received low‐dose CBDCA‐based chemoradiotherapy.},

abstract = {Background: HER2mutations are present in 2‐4% of NSCLC tumors, and ∼50% occur in the TKD. First‐line SoC for patients with HER2mutation‐positive (m+) NSCLC is platinum‐based chemotherapy 6 immunotherapy; however, no targeted first‐line treatment has been approved. Zongertinib is a HER2‐selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that binds to both wildtype and mutated HER2 but spares EGFR. In a Phase Ia trial in 53 pre‐treated patients with HER2aberration‐positive solid tumors, zongertinib conferred an objective response (OR)/ disease control rate (DCR) of 49/91% and an OR/DCR of 58/97% in those patients with HER2m+ NSCLC (n=36), with manageable safety with few EGFR‐associated toxicities (Beamion LUNG‐1; NCT04886804). Here, we describe Beamion LUNG‐2 (NCT06151574), a Phase III, randomized, active‐controlled, open‐label trial designed to assess the efficacy of first‐line zongertinib versus SoC in patients with HER2m+, locally advanced or metastatic non‐squamous NSCLC. Methods: Approximately 270 patients from ∼160 sites across 30 countries will be randomized 1: 1 to receive either zongertinib or SoC and stratified by the presence of the A775‐G77insYVMA HER2 mutation. In the experimental treatment arm, patients will receive 120 mg oral zongertinib once‐daily in 21‐day cycles. In the comparator treatment arm, patients will receive 500 mg/m2 intravenous pemetrexed chemotherapy, plus either 75 mg/m2 cisplatin or Area Under the Curve 5 carboplatin, plus 200 mg pembrolizumab on Day 1 once every 3 weeks (q3w) for four 21‐day cycles, then maintenance with 500 mg/m2 pemetrexed plus 200 mg pembrolizumab q3w for up to 35 cycles. Treatment in both arms will continue until progressive disease (PD; RECIST 1.1), undue toxicity, or other criteria are met. The primary endpoint is progressionfree survival (RECIST 1.1), by blinded central independent review. Secondary endpoints include OR (defined as best overall response of complete or partial response, RECIST 1.1); patientreported outcomes analysed as changes from baseline to Week 25; overall survival and occurrence of adverse events (CTCAE version 5.0). Key inclusion criteria are histologically or cytologically diagnosed advanced and/or metastatic non‐squamous NSCLC; ≥1 measurable lesion (RECIST 1.1); no prior systemic treatment for locally advanced or metastatic disease; a documented HER2 TKD mutation; and eligibility to receive the selected SoC. Key exclusion criteria are tumors with targetable alterations with an available treatment; presence/history of uncontrolled/symptomatic leptomeningeal disease; and radiotherapy or major surgery ≤4 weeks prior to randomization.},

For biomarker‐selected patients with LA‐NSCLC, we hypothesized that sequential pembrolizumab and risk‐adapted radiotherapy, without chemotherapy, would be well‐tolerated and effective.METHODSPatients with stage III NSCLC or unresectable stage II NSCLC and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0‐1 were eligible for this trial. Patients with a PD‐L1 tumor proportion score (TPS) of ≥50% received three cycles of induction pembrolizumab (200 mg, once every 21 days), followed by a 20‐fraction course of risk‐adapted thoracic radiotherapy (55 Gy delivered to tumors or lymph nodes with metabolic volume exceeding 20 cc, 48 Gy delivered to smaller lesions), followed by consolidation pembrolizumab to complete a 1‐year treatment course. The primary study end point was 1‐year progression‐free survival (PFS). Secondary end points included response rates after induction pembrolizumab, overall survival (OS), and adverse events.RESULTSTwenty‐five patients with a PD‐L1 TPS of ≥50% were enrolled. The median age was 71, most patients (88%) had stage IIIA or IIIB disease, and the median PD‐L1 TPS was 75%. Two patients developed disease progression during induction pembrolizumab, and two patients discontinued pembrolizumab after one infusion because of immune‐related adverse events. Using RECIST criteria, 12 patients (48%) exhibited a partial or complete response after induction pembrolizumab. Twenty‐four patients (96%) received definitive thoracic radiotherapy. The 1‐year PFS rate is 76%, satisfying our efficacy objective. One‐ and 2‐year OS rates are 92% and 76%, respectively. The most common grade 3 adverse events were colitis (n = 2, 8%) and esophagitis (n = 2, 8%), and no higher‐grade treatment‐related adverse events have occurred.CONCLUSIONPembrolizumab and risk‐adapted radiotherapy, without chemotherapy, are a promising treatment approach for patients with LA‐NSCLC with a PD‐L1 TPS of ≥50%.},

abstract = {Purpose/Objective(s): Until recently, the standard of care for patients (pts) with locally advanced, unresectable, stage III non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has been platinum‐based concurrent chemoradiation (cCRT); however, the 5‐year OS rates are poor (13–36%; Goldstraw et al. J Thorac Oncol 2015). Durvalumab (anti‐PD‐L1) monotherapy was recently approved for pts without progressive disease (PD) after cCRT. However, long‐term OS data are not yet available and further evaluation of novel cancer immunotherapy combinations should be explored. Targeted inhibition of a novel checkpoint TIGIT/PVR, by the anti‐TIGIT antibody tiragolumab, may amplify the anti‐cancer activity of anti‐PD‐L1/PD‐1 antibodies. In the phase II CITYSCAPE study (NCT03563716), tiragolumab plus atezolizumab (anti‐PD‐L1) was well tolerated and improved ORR compared with atezolizumab alone (31.3 vs 16.2%) in 1L pts with PD‐L1+ (TPS ≥1%) metastatic NSCLC; with greater benefit in the PD‐L1‐high (TPS ≥50%) subset. We hypothesize that tiragolumab plus atezolizumab may provide greater clinical benefit vs single‐agent anti‐PD‐L1 as maintenance therapy in pts with unresectable, stage III NSCLC who have not progressed after platinum‐based cCRT. SKYSCRAPER‐03 (NCT04513925) will determine if tiragolumab plus atezolizumab provides superior clinical benefit to durvalumab in this setting. Current data suggests that cCRT upregulates PD‐L1 expression, potentially enabling PD‐L1 low or negative tumors to derive benefit, so outcomes will be evaluated in all‐comer (ITT) and PD‐L1+ sub‐populations. Materials/Methods: Eligible pts (≥18 years) must have unresectable, stage III NSCLC without PD after ≥2 cycles of platinum‐based cCRT per NCCN/ESMO guidelines, and without an EGFR mutation or ALK rearrangement; known PD‐L1 status; ECOG PS 0–1. Approximately 800 pts will be randomized 1:1 to receive tiragolumab 840mg IV plus atezolizumab 1680mg IV Q4W or durvalumab 10mg/kg IV Q2W / 1500mg IV Q4W. Treatment will continue for up to 13 cycles of 28 days, or until unacceptable toxicity or symptomatic deterioration due to PD; in pts with radiographic PD (per RECIST v1.1) treatment may continue if evidence of ongoing clinical benefit. Stratification factors include PD‐L1 status, histology (squamous vs non‐squamous), staging (IIIA vs IIIB or IIIC) and ECOG PS (0 vs 1). Primary endpoint is independent review facility‐assessed PFS in the ITT and PD‐L1+ (TC ≥1%) populations. Secondary endpoints include investigator‐assessed PFS, OS, ORR and DoR. Safety and biomarker analyses will be performed. Recruitment is ongoing. Results: forthcoming Conclusion: forthcoming},

abstract = {[Formula presented] Background: Loss of immune surveillance, mediated through immune checkpoint (ICP) interactions, is thought to be a key step in the development of cancers including AML and HR‐MDS. AZA is a standard therapy for pts with AML who are unfit for IC and for pts with HR‐MDS. AZA can promote immune recognition of tumor cells and potentially increase expression of ICP molecules, which can mediate resistance to AZA. As myeloid cell lines and samples from pts treated with hypomethylating agents demonstrated up‐regulation of PD‐L1 expression, blockade of the PD‐L1 ICP with durva in combination with AZA may enhance antitumor activity and improve clinical outcomes. Here, we report the final results from a large phase 2 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of AZA+durva vs. AZA alone in pts with HR‐MDS or AML (NCT02775903). Methods: This randomized, open‐label, international, multicenter study enrolled untreated pts in 2 cohorts: 1) MDS (aged ≥18 years; IPSS‐R intermediate, high, and very high) and 2) older AML pts (aged ≥65 years) who were ineligible for IC. All pts had ECOG performance status 0‐2 and were separately randomized (1:1) to receive SC AZA 75 mg/m2 Days 1‐7 and durva 1500 mg IV on Day 1 Q4W (Arm A) or AZA alone (Arm B) and stratified according to cytogenetic risk (MDS, very good/good/intermediate vs. poor/very poor; AML, intermediate vs. poor). Treatment was planned to continue until progression or unacceptable toxicity. Disease status was evaluated every third treatment cycle. Primary MDS endpoints included overall response rate (ORR, defined as complete remission [CR], marrow [m]CR, partial response [PR], or hematologic improvement [HI]) based on IWG 2006 response criteria, while for AML ORR was defined as CR or CR with incomplete blood recovery (CRi) based on modified IWG 2003 response criteria. Secondary endpoints included PFS, OS, and safety. Peripheral blood samples were collected to assess changes in DNA methylation using the EPIC methylation array (Illumina). Bone marrow (BM) aspirates were obtained for quantitation of PD‐L1 surface expression by flow cytometry and values are reported as molecules of equivalent soluble fluorochrome. Results: A total of 213 pts, 84 with MDS (each arm, n=42) and 129 with AML (Arm A, n=64; Arm B, n=65) were randomized. As of October 31, 2018, 32 pts (MDS, n=14; AML, n=18) continued to receive trial treatment while 181 (MDS, n=70; AML, n=111) had discontinued. Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were generally balanced across treatment groups in both cohorts. Median number of treatment cycles for AML Arm A vs. B, 6.5 vs. 6.7; for MDS Arm A vs. B, 7.9 vs. 7.0. No statistically significant differences in ORR between treatment arms were observed in either cohort (Tables 1 and 2). In MDS Arm A vs. B, median OS was 11.6 vs. 16.7 months (mo) and PFS was 8.7 vs. 8.6 mo. In the AML cohort, median OS was 13.0 vs. 14.4 mo and PFS was 8.1 vs. 7.2 mo. Caution should be used when interpreting results because >50% of patients were censored. The most frequent TEAEs (≥15%) were hematologic and GI toxicity. In the MDS and AML cohorts, 7 and 17, respectively, immune‐mediated AEs were observed; all were treated and resolved. AZA induced similar trends in global hypomethylation, along with focal hypomethylation of PD‐L1 and PD‐L2 gene loci, at the end of treatment cycle 1 in all treatment groups and cohorts. Mean PD‐L1 surface expression in BM immune cells at baseline was highest in monocytes (MDS=1,425; AML=1,536), followed by granulocytes (MDS=550; AML=758) and myeloid blasts (MDS=532; AML=735). Increased surface expression of PD‐L1, but not PD‐L2, was observed at the end of treatment cycle 3 on BM granulocytes and monocytes from MDS pts and on BM monocytes from AML pts, but no increase was detected on myeloid blasts. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first large randomized trial of AZA with or without ICP blockade in older unfit AML and HR‐MDS pts reported to date. No clinically meaningful difference in efficacy was observed between treatments for either cohort. No new safety signals or potential overlapping risks were identified with the combination. While the hypomethylating activity of AZA on PD‐L1 gene was confirmed, no treatment‐mediated induction of PD‐L1 surface expression was observed on myeloid blasts.

abstract = {Over the last 3 years checkpoint inhibitors (CPI) have become established as key components in the treatment of stage III and IV NSCLC. The established CPI are PD‐1 and PD‐L1 inhibitors and more recently CTLA4 inhibitors, with ongoing research into other modulators of T‐cell function. Used alone, these agents have their greatest efficacy in a subset of patients while combination with other treatment modalities may enhance efficacy. Already concurrent pembrolizumab and chemotherapy has been shown to be more effective than chemotherapy alone for first‐line metastatic NSCLC. 1 In the clinic there are two major issues to consider when combining immunotherapy and radiotherapy. The first is safety, particularly when irradiating lung or the brain. The second issue is, can we harness radiotherapy to improve the efficacy of immunotherapy? Pneumonitis is a major concern when combining radiotherapy to the lung. Lower dose palliative radiotherapy is less of a concern but when treating primary lung cancer with curative intent, especially concurrent with chemotherapy, toxicity may impact on patient survival. In the phase III PACIFIC trial, of the 476 stage III NSCLC patients who received concurrent chemoradiation to the lung followed by durvalumab consolidation, grade ≥3 pneumonitis was 4.5% and no different from chemoradiation alone. 2 In 93 stage III patients treated with concurrent chemoradiation followed by 12 months pembrolizumab consolidation grade ≥3 pneumonitis was 6.5%. 3 We now have safety data for stage III patients with nivolumab given concurrently with thoracic chemoradiotherapy, followed by consolidation nivolumab. For the 58 patients evaluable for toxicity in the NICOLAS trial, grade ≥3 pneumonitis was 10.3%. 4 We now also have safety data for SABR (Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy) combined with CPI. Seventy nine patients (53 NSCLC) received SABR to multiple metastases, followed within 7 days by pembrolizumab. The toxicity was as expected for pembrolizumab alone. 5 Similarly Campbell has reported on treatment with concurrent SABR and pembrolizumab with either melanoma or NSCLC, with no increased toxicity. 6 Treating brain melanoma metastases with radiosurgery concurrent with ipilimumab in 57 patients, Mortier found toxicity to be as expected for immunotherapy alone 7, while a similar study by the same group found toxicity was not increased beyond that for pembrolizumab alone. There have been multiple reports, mostly of single cases, whereby local radiotherapy to a tumour causes shrinkage of a distant non‐irradiated metastasis, termed an abscopal effect. 8 It is hoped that likewise radiotherapy will enhance the effectiveness of CPI. Prior to CPI entering the clinic, in the START trial stage III patients treated with consolidation tecemotide (liposomal MUC1) vaccine following concurrent chemoradiation showed a 10 month survival advantage not seen in those who had received sequential chemoradiotherapy. 9,10 Although overall the START trial was negative for the primary endpoint, this suggested that concurrent chemoradiotherapy might enhance immunogenicity. In the PACIFIC trial of stage III NSCLC, all patients received concurrent chemoradiation. Patients randomised to a year of consolidation durvalumab had markedly improved PFS (HR 0.52) irrespective of tumour PD‐L1 expression, and overall survival data are awaited. 2 There are also now data suggesting an outcome benefit for NSCLC patients treated with concurrent SABR and CPI. In the PEMBRO‐RT trial 74 NSCLC patients were randomised to receive SABR (3 x 8GY) to a single metastasis followed within 7 days by pembrolizumab, or pembrolizumab alone. 11 All endpoints trended in favour of the combination. The primary endpoint of response rate at 12 weeks was 39% vs 21% (p=0.28), for SABR + CPI vs CPI respectively, while PFS (HR 0.61 p=0.08) and OS (HR 0.58 p=0.1) favoured combined SABR and pembrolizumab. A similar trial, NIVORAD, is being conducted by the ALTG co‐operative group, where patients are randomised to receive nivolumab with or without SABR to a metastasis site during week 2. 12 There are now good data to indicate that combining CPI and radiotherapy is safe, including radiotherapy to the lung and to the brain. Sequential concurrent chemoradiation in stage III NSCLC followed by durvalumab is highly effective. Emerging data suggest that radiotherapy may enhance the effectiveness of immunotherapy in stage IV disease but further randomised data are required. References: 1 Gandhi L.

abstract = {In the management of locally advanced (LA) non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), at least 10 studies over the past 25 years have shown superiority for chemoradiation over radiation (XRT) alone; more recently, concurrent chemoradiation has proven superior to sequential or asynchronous chemotherapy followed by XRT. Retrospective analyses evaluating outcomes in the elderly receiving these regimens have generally demonstrated similar progression‐free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) compared to their younger counterparts on study, albeit with increased toxicity.1,2,3 Generally, those over 70 years of age were under‐represented on these trials compared to the NSCLC population at large ‐ while more than 40% of those diagnosed with LA‐NSCLC were 70 years of age or older, fewer than 20% of those enrolled on relevant clinical trials were elderly.4 Virtually all of the earlier efforts were cisplatin‐based, which made the routine use of this approach in elderly patients outside of clinical trials somewhat problematic, particularly in the face of age‐associated co‐morbidities that might preclude or limit the application of platinating agents. Since the beginning of the new millennia, non‐cisplatin regimens, generally using weekly carboplatin in combination with a taxane or other partner agents active in NSCLC have been shown to yield “equivalent” efficacy with less toxicity. For elderly patients treated outside of a clinical trial, I generally favor weekly carboplatin (AUC 2) coupled with weekly solvent‐based paclitaxel (45‐50 mg/m2) in conjunction with a minimum dose of 60 Gy administered over a 6‐7 week period. At least one trial from Japan conducted exclusively in the elderly with LA‐NSCLC showed superior OS for concurrent XRT and low dose daily carboplatin vs XRT alone with median survival of 22.4 mos compared to 16.5 mos in the control group (HR 0.64).5 However, monotherapy with carboplatin during XRT is not considered the standard approach in LA‐NSCLC. The only randomized trial to compare cisplatin‐ to carboplatin‐based combinations in LA‐NSCLC was a Japanese study which randomized patients to either MVP during thoracic XRT or to weekly carbo and either irinotecan or paclitaxel; this study showed virtually no difference in long term outcome (18 to 20% 5 year survival), with pacitaxel/carboplatin proving better tolerated.6 These results are dissatisfying, but clearly better than historic controls with XRT alone (5‐7% 5 year OS). To date, unfortunately, in North American, we have no prospective, randomized, head‐to‐head comparisons of cisplatin based treatment vs. paclitaxel/carboplatin or other carboplatin‐based regimens in stage IIIA/B NSCLC. Retrospective data from the VA and the SEER database, however, suggest little difference in long term OS.7 The results of RTOG 0617 would tend to validate paclitaxel/carboplaitn as a "viable” regimen in "good prognosis” LA‐NSCLC pts with median survival in the 23 to 29 month range for weekly paclitaxel/carboplatin during radical XRT, with no advantage for 74 Gy over 60 Gy or the addition of cetuximab.8 More recently, the PACIFIC trial showed that patients with LA‐NSCLC who received “consolidative” durvalumab, a PDL1 inhibitor, for up to a year, after responding to or stabilizing on concurrent chemoradiation, could enjoy a three‐fold increase in PFS (16.8 vs 5.6 mos) and a 10% absolute improvement in OS (66.3% vs 55.6%).9 These benefits were both statistically significant (HR 0.68) and clinically meaningful; and the PACIFIC regimen featuring concurrent chemo‐radiation followed by durvalumab has emerged as the “standard of comparison” if not the “standard of care” in fit individuals with LA‐NSCLC, regardless of age. Of note, the HR for OS benefit in PACIFIC in those 65 years of age and older was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.55 ‐ 1.05) vs 0.62 (95% CI: 0.44‐ 0.88) for patients under 65. Whether this approach should be applied to patients whose tumors do not harbor PDL1 expression or whose tumors have an oncogenic driver such as EGFR mutations remains controversial. References: 1.

abstract = {Background: Consolidation durvalumab after chemoradiation (CRT) is the new standard of care in locally advanced NSCLC (LA‐NSCLC). We hypothesized that adding immunotherapy concurrently with CRT (cCRT) would increase efficacy without significant additive toxicity. To test this concept, we conducted a phase II trial called DETERRED combining atezolizumab (atezo) with cCRT followed by consolidation full dose carboplatin/paclitaxel (CP) with atezo (CP‐atezo) for 2 cycles and then maintenance atezo for 1 year. The primary endpoint was safety/toxicity and feasibility. Methods: This study enrolled patients (pts) between February 2016‐April 2018 and was done in two parts: In part 1 (N=10), conventionally fractionated CRT (60‐66 Gy in 30‐33 fractions combined with weekly low dose CP) was followed by CP‐atezo then maintenance atezo. Part 2 was cCRT (N=30) with atezo followed by CP‐atezo then maintenance atezo. Atezo was given at 1200 mg IV Q3 weeks. Severe adverse events (SAEs) ≥ grade 3 were defined by CTCAE v5.0. Evaluable pts received at least one dose of atezo. PD‐L1 staining utilizes the DAKO 22C3 platform. Kaplan Meier were analyzed for progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), and chi‐square test for PD‐L1 levels on any recurrence, with significance set at <0.05. Results: In Part 1, atezo related SAEs were seen in 4 pts (40%) (2 grade 3 arthralgia, 1 grade 3 dyspnea and 1 grade 5 TE fistula). Grade 2 radiation pneumonitis (RP) was seen in 1 pt. In Part 2, seven (23%) pts had atezo related SAEs (diarrhea, nephritis, dyspnea, fatigue and heart failure). RP was seen in 3 pts, 2 grade 2 and 1 grade 3, which led to atezo discontinuation. In Part 1, with an overall median follow up (f/u) time of 22.5 months and 27.4 months for survivors, the 1‐year PFS is 50%, and OS is 79%. In part 2, with a median f/u time of 11.8 months and 13.7 months for survivors, the 1‐year PFS was 57%, and OS is 79%. Baseline tumor biopsy PD‐L1 status was evaluable for 34 pts. There were no significant differences in cancer recurrence for PD‐L1 <1% (7/16=44%) vs ≥1% (6/18=33%), or for the PD‐L1 cutoff of <50% (11/26=42%) vs ≥50% (2/8=25%). Conclusions:Concurrent atezo with CRT followed by CP‐atezo and maintenance atezo is safe without increased toxicities compared to CRT alone followed by CP‐atezo and maintenance atezo. Updated efficacy results from DETERRED will be presented. Ultimately, the clinical benefit of immunotherapy with cCRT followed by consolidation chemo‐immunotherapy will need to be compared to the PACIFIC regimen in a larger randomized trial.},

Provision of signed, written and dated informed consent prior to any study specific procedures 2. Male or female aged 18 years or older 3. Patients must have histologically‐ or cytologically‐documented NSCLC who present with locally advanced, unresectable (Stage III) disease (according to Version 7 of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer Staging Manual in Thoracic Oncology [IASLC Staging Manual in Thoracic Oncology]), OR 4. Patients must have received at least 2 cycles of platinum‐based chemotherapy concurrent with radiation therapy, which must be completed within 5 to 10 days prior to randomisation in the study. For patients who are recovering from toxicities associated with prior treatment, randomisation may be delayed by up to 14 days from the end of the chemoradiation therapy.

PFS will be defined as the time from the date of randomisation until the date of objective disease progression or death (by any cause in the absence of progression) regardless of whether the patient withdraws from randomised therapy or receives another anti‐cancer therapy prior to progression. Thus, the two co‐primary endpoints of this study are OS and PFS.; ; USED MEASURING METHOD :RECIST 1.1 criteria will be used to assess patient response to treatment by determining PFS, ORR, DoR and DSR.; ; The methods of assessment of tumour burden used at baseline CT/MRI scans of the chest and abdomen (including liver and adrenal glands) must be used at each subsequent follow‐up assessment.; ; PERIOD OF TIME WHERE THE MEASUREMENT WILL BE CONDUCTED AND WHICH WILL ALLOW OBTAINING THE PRIMARY RESULT: The baseline assessment should be performed within 28 days of randomisation and within 5 to 10 days post the end of chemoradiation therapy, and ideally as close as possible before the start of study drug. For patients who are recovering from toxicities associated with prior treatment, randomisation may be delayed by up to 14 days from the end of the chemoradiation therapy. Efficacy for all patients will be assessed by objective tumour assessments every 8 weeks for the first 12 months (relative to the date of randomisation; then every 12 weeks thereafter until confirmed objective disease progression as defined by RECIST 1.1 (irrespective of the reason for stopping study drug and/or subsequent therapy). If an unscheduled assessment is performed, and the patient has not progressed, every attempt should be made to perform the subsequent assessments at their scheduled visits.},

abstract = {Background: Standard therapy for unresectable locally advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (LANSCLC) is concurrent chemoradiotherapy followed by adjuvant durvalumab. We performed a prospective trial testing sequential pembrolizumab and risk‐adapted radiotherapy without chemotherapy for biomarker‐selected LA‐NSCLC patients. Methods: Patients with stage III NSCLC or unresectable stage II NSCLC, ECOG performance status 0‐1, and no contraindications to protocol‐specified therapy were eligible for this trial. Subjects with PD‐L1 tumor proportion score (TPS) ≥ 50% underwent baseline FDG‐PET/CT, received three cycles of induction pembrolizumab (200 mg, every 21 days), underwent restaging FDG‐PET/CT, received risk‐adapted thoracic radiotherapy (55 Gy delivered to tumors or lymph nodes with metabolic tumor volume exceeding 20 cc and 48 Gy delivered to smaller lesions, all in 20 daily fractions), and then received up to 13 cycles of additional pembrolizumab. The primary study endpoint was one‐year progression‐free survival (PFS). Here we report response rates following induction pembrolizumab, PFS and overall survival (OS) rates, and adverse event rates (CTCAE v. 4.03). Results: Twenty‐five subjects with PD‐L1 TPS ≥ 50% from three institutions were enrolled between August 2018 and November 2021. Median age was 71 (interquartile range [IQR] 62 to 77). One subject had stage II disease, 13 had stage IIIA disease, nine had stage IIIB disease, and two had stage IIIC disease. Median PD‐L1 TPS was 75% (IQR 60 to 80%). Two subjects (8%) developed disease progression during induction pembrolizumab, and two subjects discontinued pembrolizumab after one infusion due to immune‐related adverse events. Using RECIST 1.1 criteria, 12 subjects (48%) exhibited a partial (n = 11) or complete (n = 1) response following induction pembrolizumab on CT. Using PERCIST criteria, 12 subjects (48%) exhibited a partial response following induction pembrolizumab on PET. Four subjects had responses on PET but not on CT, and four had responses on CT but not on PET. With a median follow‐up duration of 13 months, the actuarial 1‐year PFS rate is 74%, and the actuarial 1‐year OS rate is 95%. Grade 3 adverse events have been limited to single cases of anemia, arthritis, diarrhea, esophagitis, and pneumonitis, and no grade 4‐5 adverse events have occurred. Exploratory analyses suggest that response to induction pembrolizumab on PET predicts efficacy of this treatment approach, with a 1‐year PFS rate of 100% for responders, compared to 61% for nonresponders (logrank p = 0.007). Conclusions: Treatment with pembrolizumab and risk‐adapted radiotherapy is a promising treatment approach for LA‐NSCLC patients with PD‐L1 TPS ≥ 50%. Response on PET following induction pembrolizumab may be useful for identifying patients who can be treated successfully without chemotherapy.},

abstract = {Background: The phase III START study evaluated the mucin 1 (MUC1) antigen‐specific cancer immunotherapy tecemotide (L‐BLP25) vs. placebo in patients with stage III unresectable nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who did not progress following initial chemo‐radiotherapy (chemo/RT). The primary objective of overall survival (OS) prolongation was not met, however, pre‐defined subgroup analyses revealed a clinically meaningful prolongation of survival with tecemotide in patients previously treated with concurrent chemo/RT (p=0.016). Sensitivity analyses suggested the observed treatment effect may have been under‐estimated due to a clinical hold, which resulted in a median suspension of recruitment and investigational treatment of about 4.4 months. Tecemotide was well tolerated and no safety concerns were identified. Methods: From January 2007 to November 2011, 1513 patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC and stable disease or objective response following initial chemo/RT were randomized (2:1, double‐blind) to subcutaneous tecemotide (806 μg lipopeptide) or placebo, weekly for 8 weeks and then 6‐weekly until disease progression or withdrawal. A single dose of cyclophosphamide (300 mg/m2) or saline was given 3 days prior to first tecemotide/ placebo dose. Primary endpoint, OS, and secondary endpoints progression‐free‐survival (PFS) and time‐to‐treatment‐failure (TTF) used a Cox proportional hazards regression model adjusting for randomization strata. While RECIST 1.0 had to be observed for determination of disease progression, there was no formal imaging schedule to determine disease progression; this was done according to institutional practice. Exploratory analyses were done for treatment interaction for HLA‐A02, ‐DRB4 and ‐B08. Baseline peripheral blood anti‐nuclear antibodies (ANA), serum MUC1 (sMUC1), lymphocyte count and neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio (NLR) currently are being explored. Results: The primary analysis population (N=1239) was defined prospectively to account for the clinical hold and prospectively excluded 274 patients randomized within 6 months prior to onset of the hold. Median PFS was 9.6 months with tecemotide vs. 7.7 months with placebo (HR 0.865, 95%CI 0.755‐0.990, p=0.036). In keeping with OS data, tecemotide treatment effects on PFS were more pronounced in patients treated with concurrent chemo/RT (N=806; HR 0.826, 95%CI 0.696‐0.980, p=0.029) vs. sequential chemo/RT (N=433; HR 0.947, 95%CI 0.756‐1.187, p=0.638). Median TTF was 8.9 months with tecemotide vs. 7.2 months with placebo (HR 0.887, 95%CI 0.777‐1.012, p=0.075). A prolongation of TTF with tecemotide was seen in patients with prior concurrent chemo/ RT (HR 0.844, 95%CI 0.715‐0.996, p=0.045), which was absent in the subgroup with prior sequential chemo/RT (HR 0.977, 95%CI 0.784‐1.217, p=0.835). Detailed biomarker results will be presented. Conclusion: While the primary endpoint of prolongation of OS was not met, secondary endpoints PFS and TTF support the previously‐ reported finding of a more favorable effect of tecemotide in patients treated with concurrent but not sequential chemo/RT. Any potential further clinical investigation of tecemotide in locally advanced NSCLC should focus on patients following concurrent chemo/RT therapy.},

abstract = {Purpose/Objective(s): Programmed death‐1 (PD‐1) receptor‐ligand interaction inhibits T cell activation against tumor cells. MK‐3475 is a potent and highly selective humanized monoclonal antibody against PD‐1 designed to directly block its interaction with its ligands, PD‐L1 and PDL2, thus removing the inhibition of T cell activation against cancer. MK‐ 3475 led to prolonged antitumor activity in previously treated NSCLC patients. This phase 1 study evaluated the safety, tolerability, and clinical activity of MK‐3475 as initial therapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. Materials/Methods: Patients with no prior systemic therapy for metastatic disease whose tumors expressed PD‐L1 by a preliminary immunohistochemical assay were randomized to MK‐3475 10 mg/kg every 2 or 3 weeks (Q3W). The first 11 patients were randomized to 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg Q3W. At least one measurable tumor lesion, ECOG performance status of 0 to 1, adequate organ function, and adequate tumor biopsy were required for enrollment. Prior adjuvant therapy was allowed if it preceded relapse by at least 1 year. Tumor response was assessed every 9 weeks until confirmed disease progression per immune‐related response criteria (irRC; investigator review); RECIST 1.1 by independent central review will also be performed. Results: Eighty‐four patients submitted tissue for PD‐L1 assessment, and 57 patients had tumors that expressed PD‐L1. Between Feb 2013 and Oct 2013, 45 patients started treatment (n=6 2Q3W, n=23 10Q3W, n=16 10Q2W). Preliminary data indicate an ORR (confirmed and unconfirmed) of 36% (67% 2 mg/kg Q3W, 27% 10 mg/kg Q3W, 35% 10 mg/kg Q2W) by irRC. Twenty‐five patients (55%), including all but 2 responders, remain on treatment (treatment duration from 12+ to 48+ weeks). Fiftytwo percent of patients experienced a drug‐related adverse event (AE), usually grade 1‐2 in severity, most commonly fatigue (14%), pruritus (8%), dermatitis acneiform (6%), diarrhea (6%), and dyspnea (6%). There was a single drug‐related grade 3‐5 AE, a grade 3 pericardial effusion. Conclusions: These data suggest that MK‐3475 is generally well tolerated and provides robust antitumor activity in a first‐line setting in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC that expresses PD‐L1.},

abstract = {Cancer immunotherapy in a broad sense is any interaction with the immune system to treat cancer. One approach is non‐antigen‐specific modulation of the immune system. Historical examples with e.g. BCG, interferon, interleukins, were disappointing in lung cancer. More recently, specific antibodies against the Programmed Death 1 (PD‐1) receptor or its ligands (PD‐L1) have delivered exciting results, with major patient benefits in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in relapsing NSCLC {Brahmer, 2015 19949 / id}. Antigen‐specific immunotherapy aims at specific priming of immune system to recognize the tumour as foreign, thereby generating specific antibodies and/or cytotoxic T cells. This is “therapeutic cancer vaccination (TCV)”. Conditions for optimal TCV are: 1/ specificity (well‐defined target antigen(s) in the tumour, not in other tissues); 2/ selectivity (use in the population expressing the target); 3/ immunogenicity (interaction with antigen leads to effective humoral and/or cellular response); 4/ tumour sensitive to immune kill in order to obtain improvement in patients' outcome. Better knowledge of tumour immunity has led to encouraging data in phase II RCTs with several TCVs, which then have entered large phase III trials. Examples are the MAGE‐A3 vaccine studied in resected early stage NSCLC, the BLP‐25 vaccine in locally advanced NSCLC after chemoradiotherapy, and e.g. belagenpumatucel‐L and the TG4010 vaccine in advanced stage NSCLC. The MAGE‐A3 protein is totally tumour‐specific and present in about 35% of early stage NSCLC. In the hypothesis generating double‐blind, randomized, placebocontrolled phase II study, 182 patients with completely resected MAGE‐A3‐positive stage IB‐II NSCLC received recombinant MAGE‐A3 protein combined with an immunostimulant (13 doses over 27 months) or placebo (2). No significant toxicity was observed. There was a 24% ‐ non‐significant ‐ improvement in disease‐free survival (DFS, HR 0.76; 95% CI 0.48 to 1.21). The ensuing large phase III study MAGRIT (MAGE‐A3 as Adjuvant Non‐ Small Cell LunG cancer ImmunoTherapy) was reported at the ESMO 2014 meeting (3). MAGE‐A3 positive patients with completely resected stage IB‐II‐IIIA NSCLC and adjuvant chemotherapy as clinically indicated, were randomly 2:1 assigned to receive MAGE‐A3 vaccine or placebo. Almost 14,000 surgical patients were screened, 4210 patients were MAGE‐A3 positive (33%), and 2312 patients were randomised. The median DFS (primary endpoint) was slightly better with MAGE‐A3 (60.5 versus 57.9 months), but the difference was unfortunately not significant (Hazard Ratio, HR, 1.02, 95%CI: 0.89, 1.18, P=0.74). No subgroups with potential benefit could be identified. Based on this disappointing result, further development of the MAGE‐A3 vaccine in NSCLC has been abandoned. Mucins like the MUC1 protein are present in many epithelia, but MUC1 expression is altered (mainly by aberrant glycosylation) in many cancer types, including NSCLC. The tandem repeat MUC1‐peptide liposomal vaccine BLP‐25 has been studied in patients with stage IIIB‐IV NSCLC (4). While overall survival (OS) was not significantly different in the total group, a challenging effect was observed in stage IIIB patients (HR 0.524; 95%CI 0.261‐ 1.052). This led to START (Stimulating Targeted Antigenic Responses to NSCLC Trial), a phase III, double blind, RCT comparing maintenance therapy with Tecemotide (n=829) or placebo (n=410) in patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC who did not progress after sequential or concurrent chemo‐radiotherapy (5). The primary endpoint ‐ OS ‐ was not significantly different between the vaccine and placebo group (25.6 and 22.3 months). However, pre‐planned subgroup analysis showed that the patients treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (N=829) had a 10.2‐month improvement in OS (30.8 versus 20.6 months, adjusted HR 0.78, P=0.016). The consequential trial was START 2, a similar large RCT in patients who completed concurrent chemoradiotherapy for unresectable stage III NSCLC (NCT02049151). However, this RCT and further development of Tecemotide was abandoned after disappointing results of a smaller trial in Japanese patients with stage III NSCLC and concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Belagenpumatucel‐L is a vaccine based on a mixture of allogeneic tumour cells with TGF‐β2 antisense blockade as adjuvant. A phase III trial in patients with stage III‐IV NSCLC in disease control after first‐line therapy was reported at the 2013 ESMO meeting (STOP, NCT00676507) (6). Patients without progression after 1st line chemotherapy, were randomly assigned to intradermal belagenpumatucel‐L (N=270) versus placebo (N=262)for 24 months. Median OS was 20.3 months with belagenpumatucel‐L versus 17.8 months with placebo (HR 0.94, p=0.594). In subgroup analysis of patients randomized <12 weeks after the last chemotherapy, the HR of the median OS was 0.77 (P=0.092). For patients enrolled within 12 weeks and treated with previous radiotherapy, the HR was HR 0.45 (P=0.014). The vaccine was well tolerated with mainly mild local administration side‐effects. TG4010 is a vaccine based on a recombinant viral vector (attenuated strain of vaccinia virus) expressing both the tumour‐associated antigen MUC1 and interleukin‐2. This vaccine is explored in the phase IIB/III RCT TIME trial (NCT01383148). This double‐blind, placebocontrolled trial evaluates standard first‐line chemotherapy with or without TG4010 in MUC1‐positive stage IV NSCLC patients. In the phase IIB part, the predictive value of activated NKs (TrPAL: triple positive activated lymphocytes) was evaluated based on a PFS endpoint, and reported in an interim report at the 2014 ESMO meeting (7). Based on a Bayesian analysis, the predefined endpoint of a HR <1 in the patients with low level of NK cells was met. The PFS was not significantly different between vaccine and placebo (HR 0.78, 95%CI 0.55‐1.10]. In subgroup analyses, the effect was more pronounced in patients with non‐squamous NSCLC (HR 0.71, 95CI 0.51‐0.97) than in squamous histology. Therefore, a decision was made to continue the phase III part of the trial in non‐squamous NSCLC only, with OS a the primary endpoint.},

abstract = {Background: Immune checkpoint blockade in non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) may be enhanced when combined with radiation therapy. Atezolizumab (atezo) is a humanized and Fc receptor modified monoclonal antibody that blocks programmed death‐ligand‐1 (PD‐L1) interacting with PD‐1 or B7.1 sparing PD‐L2, which may result in less pulmonary toxicity. We report the early safety data of combining atezo added sequentially after standard concomitant chemoradiation (CRT) for locally advanced NSCLC (LA‐NSCLC). Methods: This is a phase II study in LA‐NSCLC assessing the safety and feasibility of adding atezo to CRT in two parts: I) sequentially (N = 10) with CP after completing CRT, or II) concurrently (N = 30) with CRT followed by consolidation atezo with CP. We report on the early toxicity results from part I of the trial. Atezo was given at 1200 mg IV Q3 weeks with consolidation CP for 2 cycles after CRT followed by atezo monotherapy for up to one year. Radiation dose at 60‐66 Gy in 30‐33 fractions was combined with weekly low dose CP, followed by 2 cycles of full dose CP. Dose limiting toxicities were defined as any adverse events (AEs) ≥ grade 3 within 15 weeks of start of therapy or any immune‐related AEs during atezo treatment. Results: From January to December 2016, 10 evaluable patients were enrolled. Seven patients have received consolidation atezo ranging from 1 to 14 doses, with 3 yet to receive atezo after completing CRT. Three patients reported potential immune‐related AEs. One patient developed grade 3 arthralgia, and another developed grade 2 radiation‐induced pneumonitis, which resolved with steroids. A third patient who experienced grade 3 dyspnea due to COPD exacerbation after 1 dose of atezo discontinued additional therapy. Of the 7 patients who have received atezo, 2 patients developed progression of disease after 6 and 8 doses of atezo. Conclusions: Atezo consolidation with 2 cycles of CP after CRT appears to be feasible and well tolerated with manageable toxicities. Additional data from part I will be reported. Conditions for proceeding after part I are met and part II of the study which adds atezo to CRT followed by atezo‐CP consolidation is open for accrual.},

abstract = {Background: Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) are a non‐invasive, anti‐mitotic treatment modality. TTFields disrupt the formation of the mitotic spindle, and dislocation of intracellular constituents. TTFields significantly extend the survival of newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients when combined with temozolomide. Efficacy of TTFields in NSCLC has been shown preclinically and in a phase I/II pilot study with pemetrexed where overall survival (OS) improved by>5 months vs historical controls. Trial design: We hypothesize that adding TTFields to 2nd line therapies in advanced NSCLC will increase OS. Patients (N=512) with squamous or non‐squamous NSCLC are enrolled in this Phase 3 study LUNAR [NCT02973789]. Patients are stratified by 2nd line therapy (PD‐1 inhibitor or docetaxel), histology (squamous vs. nonsquamous) and geographical region. Key inclusion criteria are 1st disease progression (RECIST 1.1), ECOG 0‐1, no prior surgery or radiation therapy, no electronic medical devices in the upper torso, and absence of brain metastasis. Docetaxel or PD‐1 inhibitors (either nivolumab or pembrolizumab) are given at standard doses. TTFields are applied to the upper torso for at least 18 hours/day, allowing patients to maintain daily activities. TTFields are continued until progression in the thorax and/or liver according to the immune‐related response criteria (irRC). Follow up is performed once q6 weeks including CT scans of the chest and abdomen. On progression in the upper torso patients are followed monthly for survival. The primary endpoint is superiority in OS between patients treated with TTFields in combination with either docetaxel or PD‐1 inhibitors, compared to docetaxel or PD‐1 inhibitors alone. A co‐primary endpoint compares the OS in patients treated with TTFields and docetaxel to those treated with PD‐1 inhibitors alone in a non‐inferiority analysis. Secondary endpoints include progression‐free survival, radiological response rate based on the irRC, quality of life based on the EORTC QLQ C30 questionnaire and severity & frequency of adverse events. The sample size is powered to detect a HR of 0.75 in TTFields‐treated patients versus control group.},

abstract = {Background: Interim analysis of the open‐label phase 3 RATIONALE‐307 study (NCT03594747) demonstrated clinical benefit, including significantly improved progression‐free survival (PFS) with a manageable safety profile, of tislelizumab (TIS) plus chemotherapy (chemo) as first‐line (1L) therapy in patients (pts) with advanced sq‐NSCLC vs chemo alone. Here, we report updated results. Methods: Adults with previously untreated stage IIIB (not amenable to curative surgery/radiotherapy)/IV sq‐NSCLC were randomized (1:1:1) to intravenous TIS (200mg, 21‐day cycles) + paclitaxel + carboplatin (Arm A); TIS + nab‐paclitaxel + carboplatin (Arm B); or paclitaxel + carboplatin (Arm C). The primary endpoint was PFS in Arms A and B vs Arm C, per independent review committee (IRC). Secondary endpoints included overall survival, objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DoR), and safety. Results: As of 30 September 2020 (median follow‐up 16.7 months), of 360 randomized pts, 355 received treatment. The updated median (95% confidence interval [CI]) PFS benefit was maintained for Arms A (7.7 [95%CI: 6.7, 10.4] months [mo], stratified hazard ratio [HR] 0.45 [95%CI: 0.33, 0.62]) and B (9.6 mo [95%CI: 7.4, 10.8], HR 0.43 [95%CI: 0.31, 0.60]) vs C (5.5 mo [95%CI: 4.2, 5.6]). Consistent improvements in ORR in Arms A (74.2% [95%CI: 65.4, 81.7]) and B (73.9% [95%CI: 65.1, 81.6]) vs C (47.9% [95%CI: 38.8, 57.2]) were observed. Median DoR in Arms A and B was 8.4 (95%CI: 5.0, 15.8) mo and 8.6 (95%CI: 7.1, 12.5) mo, respectively vs 4.3 (95%CI: 2.9, 5.4) mo in Arm C. The incidences of any grade (Arm A 100%; Arm B 99.2%; Arm C 100%) or ≥grade 3 (Arm A 89.2%; Arm B 87.3%; Arm C 84.6%) treatment‐emergent adverse events (TEAE) were similar between arms. The rate of treatment discontinuation due to TEAE was similar between Arms A (17.5%) and C (15.4%), and lower than in Arm B (32.2%). No new safety signal was identified. Conclusions: In RATIONALE‐307, the addition of TIS to chemo continued to demonstrate clinical benefit as 1L treatment of advanced sq‐NSCLC vs chemo alone after a longer follow‐up, with a manageable safety profile.

abstract = {Background: Enhancing clinical outcomes in resectable non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has been associated with neoadjuvant or perioperative administration of nivolumab. However, the efficacy and safety of consolidation nivolumab versus observation following neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus nivolumab, hypofractionated radiotherapy and concurrent chemotherapy (hypo‐CCRT) in patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC remain underexplored. Methods: Conducted as a randomized, multi‐center, phase 2 trial in patients with unresectable stage IIIA‐C NSCLC, this study enrolled individuals aged 18 to 75 with an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. Neoadjuvant therapy consisted of docetaxel, cisplatin, and nivolumab (360mg every 3 weeks for 2 cycles), followed by hypo‐CCRT. Patients without disease progression or G2+ pneumonitis after hypo‐CCRT were randomly assigned to receive nivolumab (360 mg every 3 weeks for up to 12 months) or undergo observation. Randomization factors included age, sex, smoking history, and EGFR mutation status. The primary endpoint was progression‐free survival (PFS) from randomization, with preplanned analysis results reported herein. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04085250. Results: Between Dec 3rd, 2019, and Aug 18th, 2023, 264 patients underwent neoadjuvant therapy, 242 received hypo‐CCRT, and 172 were randomly assigned to nivolumab consolidation (n = 86) or observation (n = 86) post hypo‐ CCRT. At the January 31, 2024, data cutoff, the median follow‐up for all randomized patients was 22.8 months. Nivolumab consolidation exhibited significantly longer PFS compared to observation (median not reached vs. 12.2 months [95% CI 6.2‐18.1]; hazard ratio 0.49 [95% CI 0.31‐0.79], p = 0.002). The 12‐month and 18‐month PFS rates were 72.6% and 64.8% in the consolidation group, contrasting with 52.5% and 42.3% in the observation group. Grade 3‐4 nonhematological adverse events occurred in 14.0% (37/264) during neoadjuvant therapy and hypo‐CCRT. Following randomization, grade 3‐5 adverse events occurred in 7.0% (6/86) with consolidation (G3 pneumonitis, 2.3%; G5 pneumonitis, 1.2%; G3 proximal bronchial tree toxicity, 3.5%) and 4.6% (4/86) with observation (G3 pneumonitis, 2.3%; G3 proximal bronchial tree toxicity, 2.3%). Conclusions: Consolidation with nivolumab after neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus nivolumab and hypo‐CCRT demonstrates effectiveness and tolerability for patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC. Extended follow‐up is essential for confirming these findings.},

abstract = {Background: Most patients (pts) with locally advanced, unresectable non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) progress despite concurrent chemoradiation therapy (cCRT). Here we report interim results from a global, Phase 3 study (NCT02125461) of the anti‐PD‐L1 durvalumab as consolidation therapy in Stage III pts without progression following platinumbased cCRT. Methods: Pts with a WHO performance status 0/1 (any PD‐L1 status) who received ≥2 cycles of platinum‐based cCRT without progression were randomized (2:1) 1‐42 days post‐cCRT to receive durvalumab 10 mg/kg IV Q2W or placebo for up to 12 months, stratified by age, sex, and smoking history. Coprimary endpoints were progression‐free survival (PFS; blinded independent central review, RECIST v1.1) and overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints included 12‐ and 18‐month PFS rates, objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DoR), time to death or distant metastasis (TTDM) and safety. Results: Between May 2014 and April 2016, Germany contributed 26 pts to the globally randomized 713 pts of whom 709 received consolidated treatment (durvalumab, n = 473; placebo, n = 236). Baseline characteristics were well balanced. As of Feb 13, 2017 (data cutoff), median followup was 14.5 months. Median PFS from randomization was significantly longer with durvalumab (16.8 months, 95% CI, 13.0‐18.1) versus placebo (5.6 months, 95% CI, 4.6‐7.8; stratified HR 0.52, 95% CI, 0.42‐0.65; P < 0.0001). 12‐ and 18‐month PFS rates were 55.9% versus 35.3% and 44.2% versus 27.0%, respectively. ORR was higher (28.4% vs 16.0%; P < 0.001) and median DoR was longer (not reached vs 13.8 months) with durvalumab consolidation therapy. Median TTDM was longer with durvalumab (23.2 vs 14.6 months; stratified HR 0.52, 95% CI, 0.39‐0.69; P < 0.0001). OS data were immature at the time of interim PFS analysis. Comparing durvalumab with placebo, grade 3/4 adverse events (AEs) occurred in 29.9% and 26.1%; most common was pneumonia (4.4% vs 3.8%). 15.4% and 9.8% discontinued due to AEs. Conclusions: Durvalumab demonstrated significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS, which was supported by secondary endpoints, and was well tolerated. Durvalumab is a promising therapeutic option in this setting.},

abstract = {Surgical resection is the standard therapy for early stage NSCLC, but about half of the patients still develop a relapse and die of their cancer. In case of unresectable locally advanced disease, the combination of chemo‐ and radiotherapy may cure some patients, but the majority will relapse. Targeted agents have brought progress for patients with advanced NSCLC selected based on molecular factors such as EGFR or ALK mutation, but other novel approaches are needed. One is therapeutic cancer vaccination (TCV), which may become an important part in our future treatment armamentarium, especially for patients with local or locally advanced NSCLC. Cancer immunotherapy in a broad sense is any interaction with the immune system to treat cancer. A first approach is non‐antigen‐specific modulation of the immune system. Historical experience (BCG, C. parvum, interferon, interleukins, thymosin, etc.) was disappointing. Promising response rates in heavily pre‐treated NSCLC patients were reported in recent phase I trials with agents acting on the interaction between antigen presenting cells, T‐lymphocytes and tumor cells. Examples are antibodies against Cytotoxic T‐lymphocyte Antigen 4 (CTLA‐4) or against Programmed Death 1 receptor or its ligands. Antigen‐specific immunotherapy aims at specific priming of immune system to recognize the tumor as foreign, thereby generating specific antibodies and/or cytotoxic T cells. This is “therapeutic cancer vaccination”. Conditions for optimal TCV are: 1/ specificity (well‐defined target antigen in the tumor, not in other tissues); 2/ selectivity (use in the population expressing the target); 3/ immunogenicity (interaction with antigen leads to effective humoral and/or cellular response); 4/ tumor sensitive to immune kill in order to obtain improvement in patients' outcome. Although the historical results of TCV for NSCLC were disappointing, knowledge from the last decades about the molecular pathology of tumors, of the immune system in general, and of tumor immunity in particular, has led to the introduction of several modern and more sophisticated TCVs. These vaccine formulations have shown encouraging data in phase II randomized clinical trials, and are now being studies in large phase III studies. Important examples are the MAGE‐A3 vaccine in resected early stage NSCLC, the BLP‐25 vaccine in locally advanced NSCLC after chemoradiotherapy, and e.g. belagenpumatucel‐L and the TG4010 vaccine in advanced stage NSCLC. The MAGE‐A3 protein is totally tumor‐specific and present in about 35% of early stage NSCLC. In the hypothesis generating double‐blind, randomized, placebo‐controlled phase II study, 182 patients with completely resected MAGE‐A3‐positive stage IB‐II NSCLC received recombinant MAGE‐A3 protein combined with an immunostimulant (13 doses over 27 months) or placebo 1. No significant toxicity was observed. There was a 24% ‐ non‐significant ‐ improvement in disease‐free survival (HR 0.76; 95% CI 0.48 to 1.21). Moreover, a predictive gene signature, initially described in advanced melanoma patients could be confirmed in early stage NSCLC 2.A large phase III study (n=2270) with MAGE‐A3 vaccine is recruited and awaiting results (MAGRIT, NCT00480025). Mucins like the MUC1 protein are present in many epithelia, but MUC1 expression is altered (mainly by aberrant glycosylation) in many cancer types, including NSCLC. The tandem repeat MUC1‐peptide liposomal vaccine BLP‐25 has been studied in patients with stage IIIB‐IV NSCLC 3. Patients in disease control after conventional treatment with chemo(‐radio)therapy were randomly assigned to BLP25 (8 weekly s.c. immunizations, followed by administration at 6‐week intervals) plus BSC or BSC alone. While overall survival (OS) was not significantly different in the total group, a challenging effect was observed in stage IIIB patients (HR 0.524; 95%CI 0.261‐ 1.052). No significant toxicity was observed. At the 2013 ASCO meeting, the double‐blind, randomized, placebo‐controlled phase III study was presented (START, NCT00409188) 4. Patients not progressing after primary chemoradiotherapy for unresectable stage III NSCLC were randomized to BLP25 or placebo. In the primary analysis population (n=1239), OS was better with the vaccine (HR 0.88, 95%CI 0.75‐1.03). In the predefined subgroup analysis in patients after concurrent chemoradiotherapy (n=806) there was a median OS difference of 10.2 months (HR 0.78, 95%CI 0.64‐0.95). While the most obvious role for TCV is for patients with small residual disease after treatment, several compound are in phase III testing in advanced NSCLC as well. Belagenpumatucel‐L is a vaccine based on a mixture of allogeneic tumor cells with TGF‐β2 antisense blockade as adjuvant. In a phase II open trial, survival was related to the dose administered 5. A phase III trial in patients with stage III‐IV NSCLC in disease control after firstline therapy is now fully recruited (STOP, NCT00676507). TG4010 is a vaccine based on a recombinant viral vector (attenuated strain of vaccinia virus) expressing both the tumor‐associated antigen MUC1 and interleukin‐2. In a phase II randomized study, 148 patients with advanced NSCLC expressing MUC1 by immunohistochemistry received either up to 6 cycles of cisplatingemcitabine plus TG4010, or the same chemotherapy alone 6. The primary endpoint, a 6‐month progression‐free survival more than 40% in the experimental arm was met.},

abstract = {Background: Previously the standard of care for patients (pts) with locally advanced, unresectable, stage III NSCLC has been cCRT; however, 5‐year overall survival (OS) rates are poor. Durvalumab (durva) is approved for pts without progressive disease (PD) after cCRT. However, long‐term OS data are not yet available. Further evaluation of novel cancer immunotherapy combinations should be explored. Targeted inhibition of the PD‐L1/PD‐1 pathway may be further amplified by combining with novel anti‐TIGIT agents such as tiragolumab (tira). In the phase II CITYSCAPE study (NCT03563716), atezo + tira was well tolerated and improved objective response rate (ORR) compared with atezo alone in 1L pts with metastatic PD‐L1+ NSCLC; with greater benefit in the PD‐L1‐high (TPS ≥50%) subset. Trial design: SKYSCRAPER‐03 (NCT04513925) aims to evaluate the efficacy of atezo + tira vs single‐agent anti‐PD‐L1 (durva) in pts with unresectable, stage III NSCLC who have not progressed after platinum‐based cCRT. Data suggests that cCRT upregulates PD‐L1 expression, potentially enabling PD‐L1 low or negative tumours to derive benefit, so outcomes will be evaluated in all‐comer (ITT) and PD‐L1+ sub‐populations. Approximately 800 pts with unresectable, stage III NSCLC without PD after ≥2 cycles of platinum‐based cCRT per NCCN/ESMO guidelines, without EGFR/ALK mutations; known PD‐L1 status; ECOG PS 0–1; will be randomised 1:1 to receive atezo 1680mg IV + tira 840mg IV Q4W or durva 10mg/kg IV Q2W/1500mg IV Q4W. Treatment will continue for up to 13 cycles of 28 days, or until unacceptable toxicity or symptomatic deterioration due to PD; in pts with radiographic PD (per RECIST v1.1) treatment may continue if evidence of ongoing clinical benefit. Stratification factors include PD‐L1 status, histology, staging and ECOG PS. Primary endpoint: independent review facility‐assessed progression‐free survival (PFS) in the ITT and PD‐L1+ (TC ≥1%) populations. Secondary endpoints: investigator‐assessed PFS, OS, ORR and duration of response, safety and biomarker analyses. Recruitment is ongoing. Clinical trial identification: NCT04513925.

abstract = {Background: Neoadjuvant chemo‐immunotherapy has become a new standard of care in locally advanced, resectable NSCLC. The SAKK 16/14 trial demonstrated a major improvement in pathological response (pCR), major pathological remission (MPR) and event‐free survival (EFS) with the addition of perioperative durvalumab after standard induction chemotherapy (ChT) with cisplatin and docetaxel. Based on data suggesting a potential enhancement of immunotherapy efficacy, the ongoing SAKK 16/18 trial investigates the addition of immune‐modulatory radiotherapy (RT) given concurrently with neoadjuvant durvalumab. Methods: In this non‐comparative randomized phase II trial patients (pts) with resectable stage IIIA‐B(N2) (cT1‐3 or T4 due to size N2 M0) NSCLC receive 3 cycles of cisplatin 100mg/m2 and docetaxel 85mg/m2 followed by durvalumab (1500mg) and one of three randomized RT regimens before tumor resection and adjuvant durvalumab for 1 year. RT is delivered to the primary tumor only, using either 20x2 Gy, 5x5 Gy, or 3x8 Gy (deliverd inhomogenously). RT planning is optimized for strict organ at risk and mediastinal lymph node sparing. The primary endpoint is 1‐year EFS. We report a preplanned interim analysis of the secondary endpoints safety, surgical outcomes and pathological response after surgery in 25 pts. Results: At data cut‐off on Oct 8, 2022, 25 pts had reached post‐operative day 30 and a total of 31 pts were included in the safety analysis. Thirty pts (97%) had at least one treatment related adverse events (TRAE). Eighty‐eight % were attributed to neoadjuvant ChT (16% G3‐4), 4%each to neoadjuvant durvalumab (1% G3) and RT (1% G4), and 8% to surgery (35% G3‐4). One fatal TRAE occurred in a pt with COVID‐pneumonia during neoadjuvant ChT. No difference in safety was seen between the three RT arms. There was no treatment‐related cancellation or delay in surgery and 0% 30‐day postoperative mortality. Eighty‐one%of pts underwent tumor resection (96% R0). Non‐resection was due to death (n = 1), progressive disease (n = 3), or unresectable tumor (n = 2). The pCR‐rate was 28%, andMPR (≤10% viable tumor cells) was detected in 76% of all specimens. Details of pathological responses with regard to immune‐modulatory RT regimen will be presented at the meeting. Conclusions: The preplanned interim safety analysis of the SAKK 16/18 trial did not show a relevant increase in TRAE due to immune‐modulatory RT. Surgical feasibility and safety are confirmed and the trial continues enrolment to a planned total of 90 pts (30 per RT arm). Preliminary pathological responses are promising, and exploratory analyses will study potential differences between the RT regimens, in order to better understand the potential role of immune‐modulatory RT in the multimodal treatment of resectable stage III(N2) NSCLC.},

abstract = {Background Durvalumab following chemoradiation (CRT) is a standard of care for stage III unresectable NSCLC, but there remains an unmet need for improved therapeutic options among pts with driver mutated tumours that are unresponsive to immunotherapy. As targeting of specific driver mutations (e.g., ALK, RET, ROS1) has proven effective in the metastatic setting, it is hypothesised that outcomes could also be improved for pts with driver‐mutated stage III NSCLC. Trial design BO42777 is a phase I–III platform study evaluating the safety and efficacy of multiple targeted therapies vs durvalumab following CRT in pts with locally advanced, unresectable, Stage III NSCLC. Biomarker eligibility is determined via local tissue testing or central testing within the BX43361 master screening study. Biomarker‐eligible pts are enrolled into the relevant cohort and randomised 1:1 to receive durvalumab or targeted therapy (alectinib [ALK+], entrectinib [ROS1+], or pralsetinib [RETfusion+]). New cohorts maybe added in the future. Key inclusion criteria: locally advanced, unresectable Stage III NSCLC, age ≥18 years, ≥2 prior cycles of concurrent or sequential CRT (cCRT or sCRT), ECOG PS 0–2. Pts are stratified based on staging (IIIA vs IIIB or IIIC), CRT type (cCRT vs sCRT), and PD‐L1 status (tumour cell score <1% vs ≥1% vs unknown) and will receive investigational treatment for 3 years or durvalumab for 1 year, until progression or maximum duration of treatment, unacceptable toxicity, consent withdrawal, or death. Primary endpoint: progression‐free survival (RECIST v1.1) by blinded independent central review. Key secondary endpoints: distant metastasis‐free survival, time to CNS progression, objective response rate, duration of response, overall survival, and safety (adverse events). Time to confirmed deterioration and patient‐reported outcomes will be assessed through questionnaires. Tumour response will be assessed by CT/MRI imaging at regular intervals. Enrolment is ongoing (target of 320 pts) across 200 sites in 11 countries. As of 6 Jan 2023, 2 pts have been randomised. Clinical trial identification NCT05419375 & NCT05170204.

abstract = {Background: Pembrolizumab (pembro; anti‒PD‐1) + cCRT demonstrated robust antitumor activity and manageable safety in the KEYNOTE‐799 study in previously untreated, locally advanced, stage III NSCLC. The combination of vibostolimab (MK‐7684; monoclonal antibody that inhibits T‐cell immunoglobulin and ITIM domain [TIGIT] immunomodulatory receptor) + pembro with/without chemotherapy (chemo) has shown promising antitumor activity with manageable safety in patients (pts) with advanced NSCLC in the KEYVIBE‐001 study. The KEYVIBE‐006 study (NCT05298423) is evaluating MK‐7684A (co‐formulation of vibostolimab + pembro) + cCRT followed by MK‐7684A vs cCRT followed by durvalumab (anti‒PD‐L1) in unresectable, locally advanced, stage III NSCLC. Trial design: In this phase 3, open‐label, randomized study, ∼784 eligible adults with previously untreated, unresectable, pathologically confirmed stage IIIA‒C NSCLC; measurable disease by RECIST v1.1; and ECOG PS of 0/1 will be randomized 1:1. In arm A, pts receive intravenous (IV) MK‐7684A (vibostolimab 200 mg + pembro 200 mg) Q3W + 3 cycles of chemo (one of: cisplatin 75 mg/m2 + pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 [nonsquamous only]; cisplatin 50 mg/m2 + etoposide 50 mg/m2; or carboplatin AUC 6 mg/mL/min [cycle 1] and AUC 2 mg/mL/min [cycles 2/3] + paclitaxel 200 mg/m2 [cycle 1] and 45 mg/m2 [cycles 2/3]) + standard thoracic radiotherapy (TRT; 60 Gy in 2‐Gy fractions; cycles 2/3) followed by vibostolimab 200 mg + pembro 200 mg for up to 17 cycles. Pts in arm B receive 3 cycles of chemo + TRT (as above) followed by durvalumab 10 mg/kg IV Q2W for up to 26 cycles. Treatment continues until treatment completion, PD, unacceptable toxicity, or investigator decision. Randomization is stratified by histology (squamous vs nonsquamous), stage (IIIA vs IIIB/IIIC), PD‐L1 TPS (<1% vs ≥1%), and region (East Asia vs North America/Western Europe/Australia vs rest of world). Dual primary endpoints are PFS per RECIST v1.1 by blinded independent central review (BICR) and OS.

abstract = {Background: Despite aggressive therapy with concurrent chemoradiation, fewer than 25% of patients with stage 3 NSCLC achieve 5‐year survival and are presumably cured. To date, treatment modifications‐including consolidation chemotherapy, maintenance therapy with molecularly targeted agents, concomitant administration of monoclonal antibodies, and escalation of radiation therapy (RT) dose‐have not improved these outcomes. Immune checkpoint inhibitors represent an effective treatment for advanced NSCLC and may enhance RT‐associated anti‐tumor immunity. RTOG 3505 will test whether the addition of the anti‐programmed death 1 (PD1) antibody nivolumab after chemoradiation improves overall survival (OS) and progression‐free survival (PFS) in this population. Methods: Key eligibility criteria include surgically unresectable stage 3 NSCLC, ECOG 0‐1, adequate organ function, available archival tissue, and absence of active autoimmune disease. Patients will receive thoracic RT to 60 Gy with concurrent cisplatin 50 mg/m2IV on Days 1, 8, 29, and 36, and etoposide 50 mg/m2IV on Days 1‐5 and 29‐33. This regimen was selected to (1) minimize risk of pulmonary toxicity and steroid requirements, and (2) optimize timing of immunotherapy. Between 4 and 12 weeks after completion of chemoradiation, eligible patients will be randomized to nivolumab 240 mg IV or placebo every 2 weeks for 1 year. Stratification factors include performance status, histology, and tumor PD‐L1 status. Co‐primary endpoints are OS and PFS, as determined by central radiology review. Secondary objectives include toxicity assessment, patient‐reported outcomes and quality of life, and OS and PFS according to PD‐L1 expression. Exploratory objectives include biomarkers to predict treatment efficacy and toxicity. A total of 660 patients will be enrolled to provide ≥90% power to detect (1) a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.7 for OS with two‐sided type I error of 0.04, and (2) HR of 0.667 for PFS twosided type I error of 0.01, allowing a 16.7% drop‐out rate before randomization.},

abstract = {Background: Tempo‐Lung trial randomly assessed the role of metronomic oral vinorelbine (OV) vs standard weekly oral vinorelbine in advanced NSCLC patients (pts) unfit to platinum doublets. Little data are available on treatment options after first‐line in platinum‐unfit pts. Methods: Advanced NSCLC pts unfit to receive platinum doublets (Creatinine clearance <60 ml/min; heart failure NYHA class II‐III; hearing loss >G2; any medical condition impairing platinum treatment according to physician's opinion) were randomized to arm A (metronomic): OV 50mg x3/week (wk) or arm B (standard): OV 60 mg/m2/ wk cycle 1, then 80 mg/m2/wk. Primary endpoint was progression free‐survival without grade 4 toxicity (PFSG4) and secondary efficacy and safety end‐point, quality of life (QoL). Data on treatment after failure of first‐line vinorelbine were collected. Results: Intention‐to‐treat population included 165 (arm A 83 ‐ arm B 82) pts. Baseline characteristics were well balanced between both arms. Mean dose intensity by cycle: 73.56 mg/m2/week (arm A), 55.85 mgm2/week (arm B). Median PFSG4 significantly differ in favor of metronomic arm [95%CI]: 4.0 [2.6‐4.3] vs2.2 [1.5‐2.9] months (p = 0.0068), HR [95%CI] = 0.63 [0.45‐0.88]. Overall treatment related adverse events (61.4% vs84%): haematological toxicities (27.7% vs55.6%), G3/4 neutropenia (11% vs 42%), febrile neutropenia (3.6% vs 6.2%) and G3/4 asthenia (4.8% vs 8.6%) were reduced with metronomic OV. It was observed that 40% of patients (subset) had second line treatment: immunotherapy, chemotherapy, protein kinase inhibitor, radiotherapy. No difference was found for changes in EORTC QoL scores. Secondary endpoints will be presented. Conclusions: Metronomic OV could be a suitable option for advanced NSCLC pts unfit to receive platinum doublets. Less toxicity was observed in metronomic arm. QoL scores were similar in both arms. A subset of platinum unfit patients could receive second‐line treatment mainly consisting on immunotherapy, chemotherapy.},

abstract = {Background: Durvalumab following chemoradiation (CRT) is a standard of care for unresectable stage III NSCLC, but there remains an unmet need for improved therapeutic options among patients with drivermutated tumors that are unresponsive to immunotherapy. As targeting of specific driver mutations (e.g. ALK, RET, ROS1) has proven effective in the metastatic setting, it is hypothesized that outcomes could also be improved for patients with driver‐mutated stage III NSCLC. Methods: BO42777 (NCT05170204) is a phase I‐III platform study evaluating the safety and efficacy of multiple targeted therapies versus durvalumab following CRT in patients with locally advanced, unresectable stage III NSCLC. Biomarker eligibility is determined via local tissue testing or central testing within the BX43361 master screening study (NCT05419375). Biomarker‐eligible patients are enrolled into the relevant cohort and randomized 1:1 to receive durvalumab or targeted therapy (alectinib [ALK+], entrectinib [ROS1+], or pralsetinib [RET fusion+]). New cohorts may be added in the future. Key inclusion criteria: locally advanced, unresectable stage III NSCLC, age ≥18 years, ≥2 prior cycles of concurrent or sequential CRT (cCRT or sCRT), and ECOG PS 0‐2. Patients are stratified based on staging (IIIA vs IIIB or IIIC), CRT type (cCRT vs sCRT), and PD‐L1 status (tumor cell score<1%vs≥1% vs unknown) and will receive investigational treatment for three years or durvalumab for one year, until progression or maximum duration of treatment, unacceptable toxicity, consent withdrawal, or death. Primary endpoint: progression‐free survival (RECIST v1.1) by blinded independent central review. Key secondary endpoints: distant metastasis‐free survival, time to CNS progression, objective response rate, duration of response, overall survival, and safety (adverse events). Time to confirmed deterioration and patient‐reported outcomes will be assessed through questionnaires. Tumor response will be assessed by CT/MRI imaging at regular intervals. Enrolment is ongoing (target of 320 patients) across 200 sites in 11 countries. As of 7 February 2023, five patients have been randomized. This trial in progress was previously presented at ELCC, Luis Paz‐Ares et al. (#744), and reused with permission.},

abstract = {Background: Programmed cell death‐1/ligand 1 (PD‐1/PD‐L1) inhibitors have become key treatment options for advanced NSCLC without EGFR, ALK, or ROS1 mutations. Here, we report on the antitumour activity of cemiplimab, an anti–PD‐1, alone or plus ipilimumab (an anti‐cytotoxic T‐lymphocyte‐associated protein 4 agent) in second‐line (2L) advanced NSCLC. Methods: Patients with advanced NSCLC were randomised (1:1:1; stratified by histology and PD‐L1 status) to receive cemiplimab 350 mg once every 3 weeks (Q3W) (Arm A); or cemiplimab 350 mg Q3W plus ipilimumab 50 mg once every 6 weeks (Q6W) (up to 4 doses) (Arm B); or cemiplimab 1050 mg Q3W (Arm C), for up to 108 weeks or until disease progression. Primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) in patients with PD‐L1 expression <50%, per independent central review. Data cut‐off was 28 Aug 2019. Results: Of 28 patients enrolled, 27 received treatment (Arm A, n=8; Arm B, n=11; and Arm C, n=8). Median (range) age was 68 (46–80) years; 71.4% were male; 39.3% had prior radiotherapy; 67.9% had non‐squamous NSCLC; and 57.1% had a PD‐1 level <1%. Median duration of treatment exposure was 10.8 (Arm A), 17.9 (Arm B), and 10.8 (Arm C) weeks. ORR (95% confidence interval) was 0% (0.0–36.9%) in Arm A, 45.5% (16.7–76.6%) in Arm B and 11.1% (0.3–48.2%) in Arm C. For patients with PD‐L1 levels <1%, ORR was 36.4% (Arm B), and 11.1% (Arm C); for patients with PD‐L1 levels of 1–49%, ORR was 9.1% (Arm B), and 0% (Arm C). Median duration of response (DOR) has not been reached; observed DOR was 2+ to 6.9+ (Arm B) and 4.8+ months (Arm C). Most common treatment‐emergent adverse events of any grade were decreased appetite and constipation (each 37.5%) in Arm A; hypothyroidism and pneumonia (each 36.4%) in Arm B; and decreased appetite (37.5%) in Arm C. Across all arms, increased alanine aminotransferase was the only Grade ≥3 immune‐related adverse event reported in >1 patient (Arm B; 18.2%). Conclusions: In patients with advanced NSCLC and <50% PD‐L1 expression, 2L combination treatment with cemiplimab 350 mg + ipilimumab 50 mg exhibited numerically higher antitumour activity than cemiplimab monotherapy (350 or 1050 mg).

abstract = {Background: SPECTRA, a multicenter, randomized phase II study of CDDP+S‐1 versus CDDP+pemetrexed (PEM) combined with thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) for locally advanced non‐squamous non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), previously reported that toxicities were tolerable and manageable in both arms; however, febrile neutropenia was more frequently observed in the CDDP+S‐1 arm (9.6%/2%). Completion rate of TRT (60Gy) and chemotherapy (4 cycles) was 92%/98% and 73%/86%, respectively. Response rate was 60%/64% (WCLC 2017, MA17.06). Here, we present primary analysis of 2‐year survival data. Method: Patients were randomly assigned to receive CDDP+S‐1 (CDDP 60mg/m2, d1, and S‐1 80mg/m2, d1‐14, q4w, up to 4 cycles) or CDDP+PEM (CDDP 75mg/m2, d1, and PEM 500mg/m2, d1, q3w, up to 4 cycles) combined with TRT 60Gy in 30 fractions. The primary endpoint was 2‐year progression‐free survival (PFS) rate. The sample size was set at 100 patients. Result: Between Jan 2013 and Oct 2016, 102 patients were enrolled in this study from 9 institutions in Japan. All 102 patients were eligible and assessable, of whom 52 were assigned to CDDP+S‐1 and 50 to CDDP+PEM. Baseline characteristics were similar (CDDP+S‐1/CDDP+PEM): median age (range) 64.5 (39‐73)/63.5 (32‐74) years; women, n=17 (33%)/n=17 (34%); stage IIIB, n=21 (40%)/n=20 (40%); ECOG PS of 1, n=14 (27%)/n=14 (28%); never smoker, n=12 (23%)/n=12 (24%); and adenocarcinoma, n=47(90%)/n=45(90%); activating EGFR mutation, n=9 (17%)/n=4 (8%); ALK fusion, n=2 (4%)/n=3 (6%). A total of 72 PFS events were observed at the data cut‐off (28 November 2018). After a median follow‐up of 32.1 months, median PFS was 12.7/13.8 months (HR=1.16, 95% CI, 0.73‐1.84, p=0.538), and 2‐year PFS rate was 36.5% (95% CI, 23.5‐49.6)/32.1% (95%CI, 18.9‐45.4). Disease progression was observed in 33 and 36 patients. Distant metastases were the first site of failure in 24 and 31 patients. Local relapse as the first site of failure was observed in 14 and 13 patients. After a median follow‐up of 34.6 months, 44 OS events were observed. Median OS was 48.3/59.1 months (HR=1.05, 95%CI, 0.58‐1.90, p=0.883), and 2‐year OS rate was 69.2% (95%CI, 56.7‐81.8)/66.4% (95%CI, 53.0‐79.9). 27 patients in each arm received post‐study chemotherapy including EGFR‐TKIs (n=7/n=5), ALK‐TKIs (n=0/n=3), and immune checkpoint inhibitors (n=6/n=10). Conclusion: 2‐year PFS rate in the CDDP+S‐1 arm was better than that in the CDDP+PEM arm. We will select the CDDP+S‐1 arm as the investigational arm in a future phase III study.

abstract = {Background: Durvalumab, an engineered human IgG1 anti‐PD‐L1 mAb, demonstrated an improvement in PFS vs placebo and favorable benefit/risk profile in the Phase 3 PACIFIC study in locally advanced, unresectable NSCLC. Here we summarize patient‐reported outcomes from PACIFIC. Method: In the randomized, double‐blind, Phase 3 PACIFIC study (NCT02125461), patients who had previously received ≥2 cycles of platinum‐based concurrent chemotherapy with definitive dose radiation without disease progression were randomized (2:1) to durvalumab 10 mg/kg i.v. q2w or placebo for up to 12 months. Secondary endpoints included evaluation of symptoms, function and global health status/QoL using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ‐C30 v3 questionnaire and its lung cancermodule, QLQ‐LC13. Patients completed the questionnaires at baseline, Week 4, Week 8, q8w until Week 48, then q12w until disease progression. Changes from baseline for key symptoms were analyzed using a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM). Time to deterioration (TTD) and odds of improvement were analyzed. Deterioration or improvement was defined as a change in score from baseline ≥10. Hazard ratios (HR) were calculated using a stratified log‐rank test and odds ratios (OR) using logistic regression. Result: Compliance with completing the questionnaires was high in both durvalumab (n = 476) and placebo (n = 237) groups (>80% up to Week 48). There were no differences between groups at baseline in symptoms, function or global health status/QoL. MMRM analysis showed no statistically significant differences between treatment groups in adjusted mean changes from baseline (average over 12 months) in the prespecified symptoms of dyspnea, cough, chest pain, fatigue and appetite loss, and for global health status/QoL and physical functioning. Clinically relevant improvements from baseline were observed throughout the study in both durvalumab and placebo groups for dysphagia (mean [SD] change at Week 48, ‐14.2 [26.1] and ‐14.8 [25.3], respectively) and alopecia (‐22.1 [33.0] and ‐21.4 [29.5]). There were no differences in median TTD between groups except 'other pain' (9.2 months with durvalumab vs 5.6 months with placebo [HR 0.72; 95% CI 0.58, 0.89]). The only difference in improvement rates between groups was for appetite loss (26.1% improvement rate with durvalumab vs 24.9% with placebo [OR 1.72; 95%CI 1.04, 2.85]). Other symptoms, function and health‐related QoL remained stable throughout with no between‐group differences in TTD or improvement rates. Conclusion: Durvalumab treatment did not worsen symptoms, function or healthrelated QoL. Clinically relevant improvement in alopecia and dysphagia with durvalumab and placebo was likely due to resolution of toxicities related to prior chemoradiation.},

abstract = {Cytokine interleukin‐1β (IL‐1β) has multiple pro‐tumorogenic effects on tumor microenvironment, thereby promoting carcinogenesis, tumor invasiveness, and immunosuppression. CAN is a selective IL‐1β inhibitor that aims to target tumor‐promoting inflammation to reduce immune suppression, thereby potentiating effects of immunotherapy with PD‐1 inhibitors such as PEM. Results of phase 3 CANTOS study have shown that IL‐1β inhibition with CAN was associated with reduced incidence of lung cancer and lung cancer mortality, thus providing a rationale to investigate therapeutic role of CAN in lung cancer. CANOPY‐1 (NCT03631199) is a placebo‐controlled, double‐blind, randomized, phase 3 trial designed to evaluate efficacy and safety of PEM + Ctx ± CAN in previously untreated pts with stage IIIB/IIIC (not eligible for definitive chemo‐radiation curative tx) or stage IV squamous and nonsquamous NSCLC. The study was divided into 2 parts: part 1 is non‐randomized, safety run‐in part where pts received CAN 200 mg s.c Q3W + PEM 200 mg i.v Q3W + platinum‐based Ctx [Cohort A (non‐squamous), carboplatin + pemetrexed; Cohort B (non‐squamous), cisplatin + pemetrexed; Cohort C (squamous or non‐squamous), carboplatin + paclitaxel]. Part 2 of the study randomizes pts to evaluate efficacy and safety of CAN combination regimen vs placebo combination regimen. Primary objective of safety run‐in part: RP3R for CAN in combination with PEM + Ctx. Secondary objectives: ORR, DCR, DOR, safety, PK, and immunogenicity. As of 14 May 2019 (follow‐up of ≥42 days from C1D1 unless pt discontinued earlier), 10 pts in cohort A (A), 11 pts in cohort B (B), and 9 pts in cohort C (C) were treated, of which 73% were male, median age was 63 yrs. In total, 24/30 (80%) pts enrolled were still receiving tx; primary reason for tx discontinuation was progressive disease (5 pts; 3 pts in A and 1 pt each in B and C) and 1 patient died due to study indication. Dose‐limiting toxicity (DLT) occurring during first 42 days of study tx was reported only in 1 pt (cohort C: grade 3 hepatitis, not related to CAN). Recommended phase 3 regimen (RP3R) of CAN in combination with standard dose of PEM + Ctx was confirmed as 200 mg SC Q3W based on Bayesian logistic regression model (BLRM). Serious AEs regardless of study drug relationship were reported in 8 (27%) pts (2 pts in A and 3 pts each in B and C), none of which considered to be related to CAN. Most common AEs (≥20%, any grade) across all cohorts (n=30) were nausea (37%), vomiting (30%), constipation and fatigue (each 23%), and neutrophil count decrease (20%). Overall, 14 pts (47%) experienced grade 3 AEs and 1 pt experienced grade 4 AE (cardiac tamponade unrelated to study drugs). No fatal serious AEs were reported. AEs leading to discontinuation of one of the study drugs were reported in 3 (10%) pts (hepatitis, peripheral neuropathy, and polyneuropathy) but none were CAN related. AEs leading to dose reduction and dose interruption of one of study drugs were reported in 3 (10%) pts and 5 (17%) pts, respectively. Only 1 DLT was reported with this triplet combination of CAN + PEM + Ctx. Based on BLRM and all relevant data, the RP3R of CAN as 200 mg SC Q3W combination was considered safe and well tolerated. Enrolment is ongoing in randomized phase 3 part of study to evaluate efficacy and safety.},

abstract = {Approximately 40‐50% of all patients with NSCLC present with Stage IV or metastatic disease. Although advances in systemic therapy have led to significant improvements in response rates, OS remains poor. Data suggest that oligometastatic patients, defined here as having ≤ 5 metastases, may have improved outcomes in comparison to patients with more significant metastatic burden Immunotherapy containing regimens are now standard of care in Stage IV NSCLC and have led to improved outcomes. However, response rates to immunotherapy are variable, are often not sustained, and optimal predictors of response have yet to be determined. Recent data suggest that responses to immunotherapy may in part be determined by pretreatment tumor burden and that even robust induction of anti‐tumor T cell response by immune therapy may be clinically ineffective in the tumor burden is too high. Both human and animal data have demonstrated that radiotherapy can potentiate response to immunotherapy checkpoint inhibitors through multiple mechanisms. High dose per fraction radiotherapy, such as the type employed in stereotactic body radiotherapy, are particularly effective in enhancing anti‐tumor immune responses. While radiation therapy plays a central role in curative intent management of non‐metastatic (Stages I‐III) NSCLC, its role in metastatic disease has traditionally been confined to palliation of pain, relief of lumenal obstruction, or CNS metastases. Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (SABR) is an advanced form of treatment which permits precise targeting of tumors with high doses of radiation using steep dosimetric gradients for protection of surrounding normal tissues. Randomized studies have demonstrated that oligometastatic patients who receive consolidative local radiotherapy (radiotherapy given after initial systemic therapy) to all metastatic sites experience improved outcomes in comparison to maintenance chemotherapy alone. It is notable that these studies were conceived and performed before immunotherapy regimens were first‐line standard of care. These and data described above imply that neoadjuvant delivery of SBRT may enhance response to immunotherapy and minimize pre‐immunotherapy tumor burden. We hypothesize that neoadjuvant SABR/Hypofractionated radiotherapy to oligometastatic NSCLC (≤5 metastases) can synergize with immunotherapy containing systemic agents leading to improved outcomes and response rates. We plan to evaluate this hypothesis with the following specific aims. Aim 1: Establish logistical feasibility and safety of neoadjuvant SBRT to oligometastatic sites of disease. Aim 2: Evaluate treatment responses and outcomes of patients randomized to be treated with neoadjuvant SBRT followed by standard of care systemic therapy vs standard of care therapy alone. In this Aim we compare OS, PFS, time to new metastases, and toxicity and quality of life in patients receive standard of care. Secondary analyses will evaluate responses based on PDL‐1 expression status, number and sites of metastases, and other clinical factors. Brief Methods and Eligibility: After stratification by PDL‐1 expression status and number of metastases, patients will be randomized between two arms as follows: Arm 1 ‐ standard of care systemic therapy; and Arm 2 – SABR/Hypofractionated RT to all radiographically identified disease followed by standard of care systemic therapy. Patients will be randomized 1:2 (Arm 1: Arm 2). Radiotherapy dose and fractionation for patients receiving SABR will depend on proximity to and/or dosimetry to organs at risk. This study aims to accrue a total of 90 patients within 4 years. The primary endpoint is overall survival, and secondary endpoints include toxicity, quality of life, progression‐free survival, local and regional control rates, and systemic therapy‐free survival.

abstract = {Background: Most patients (pts) with locally advanced, unresectable non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) progress despite concurrent chemoradiation therapy (cCRT). Here we report interimresults from a global, Phase 3 study of the anti‐PD‐L1 durvalumab as consolidation therapy in Stage III pts without progression following platinumbased cCRT. Methods: Pts with aWHOperformance status 0/1 (any PD‐L1 status) who received 2 cycles of platinum‐based cCRT without progression were randomized (2:1) 1‐42 days post‐cCRT to receive durvalumab 10 mg/kg IV Q2W or placebo for up to 12 months, stratified by age, sex, and smoking history. Co‐primary endpoints were progressionfree survival (PFS; blinded independent central review, RECIST v1.1) and overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints included 12‐and 18‐month PFS rates, objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DoR), time to death or distant metastasis (TTDM) and safety. Results: Between May 2014 and April 2016, 713 pts were randomized of whom 709 received consolidated treatment (durvalumab, n 473; placebo, n 236). Baseline characteristics were well balanced. As of Feb 13, 2017 (data cutoff), median follow‐up was 14.5 months. Median PFS from randomization was significantly longer with durvalumab (16.8 months, 95% CI, 13.0‐18.1) versus placebo (5.6 months, 95% CI, 4.6‐7.8; stratified HR 0.52, 95% CI, 0.42‐0.65; P<0.0001). 12‐and 18‐month PFS rates were 55.9% versus 35.3% and 44.2% versus 27.0%, respectively. ORR was higher (28.4% vs 16.0%; P<0.001) and median DoR was longer (not reached vs 13.8 months) with durvalumab consolidation therapy. Median TTDM was longer with durvalumab (23.2 vs 14.6 months; stratified HR 0.52, 95% CI, 0.39‐0.69; P<0.0001). OS data were immature at the time of interim PFS analysis. Comparing durvalumab with placebo, grade 3/4 adverse events (AEs) occurred in 29.9% and 26.1%; most common was pneumonia (4.4% vs 3.8%). 15.4% and 9.8%discontinued due to AEs. Conclusions: Durvalumab demonstrated significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS, which was supported by secondary endpoints, and was well tolerated. Durvalumab is a promising therapeutic option in this setting.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: For patients with locally advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the standard treatment is concurrent or sequential chemotherapy with radiotherapy. Most treatment schedules use radiotherapy with conventional fractionation; however, the application of hypofractionated radiotherapy (HYPO‐RT) regimens is rising. A meta‐analysis was performed to assess the efficacy and safety of chemotherapy combined with HYPO‐RT and indirectly compare with the outcomes from previous studies employing concomitant conventional radiotherapy (CONV‐RT). METHODS: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were identified on the electronic database sources through June 2020. Following the PRISMA guidelines, a meta‐analysis was performed to assess if there were significant differences in the overall mortality (OM), local failure (LF), and disease progression (DP), comparing HYPO‐RT‐C vs. sequential chemotherapy followed HYPO‐RT (HYPO‐RT‐S). To establish an indirect comparison with the current standard treatment, we calculate the risk ratio (RR) of the OM from RCTs using conventional chemoradiation, concurrent (CONV‐RT‐C), and sequential (CONV‐RT‐S), and compared with HYPO‐RT. A P value <0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Two RCTs with a total of 288 patients were included. The RR for the OM, DP and LF at 3 year comparing HYPO‐RT‐C vs. HYPO‐RT‐S were 1.09 (95% CI: 0.96‐1.28, P=0.17), 1.06 (95% CI: 0.82‐1.23, P=0.610), and 1.06 (95% CI: 0.86‐1.29, P=0.490), respectively. The late grade 3 pneumonitis and esophagitis had no significant difference between HYPO‐RT groups. In the indirect comparison of RCTs using CONV‐RT, the RR for the OM at 3 years was 1.03 (95% CI: 0.96‐1.10, P=0.36) with no significant difference for the HYPO‐RT arms 1.09 (95% CI: 0.96‐1.28, P=0.17). DISCUSSION: HYPO‐RT given with chemotherapy provides satisfactory OM, LF, and DP in locally advanced NSCLC with similar rates to the CONV‐RT. These findings support HYPO‐RT inclusion in future clinical trials as an experimental arm in addition to the incorporation of new strategies, such as immunotherapy.},

abstract = {Introduction: Docetaxel is one of the standard 2nd‐line treatments for advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but the effect is limited. The combination of docetaxel and ramucirumab/nintedanib has demonstrated antitumor activity as 2nd‐line therapy in advanced NSCLC. Anlotinib, an oral multi‐target angiogenesis, can prolong both PFS and OS of refractory advanced NSCLC patients in phase III trial (ALTER0303). We conducted ALTER‐L018 to evaluate improvement of the efficacy and safety of anlotinib plus docetaxel in EGFR‐negative advanced NSCLC. Methods: In this multi‐center, randomized, controlled comparative, phase II trial, patients from 10 sites in China, with EGFR wild‐type NSCLC progressing after 1st‐line platinum‐based therapy (combined with or without Immune checkpoint inhibitors), were randomly allocated (1:1) to receive anlotinib (12mg QD from day 1 to 14 of a 21‐day cycle) plus docetaxel (75mg/m2 Q3W) (group A+D) or docetaxel (75mg/m2 Q3W) only (group D). Primary end point was PFS, and secondary end points included OS, ORR, DCR and safety. [ Clinical Trials Registration: NCT03624309 ]. Results: Between Jan 14, 2019, and Jun 18, 2021, 96 patients (pts) were enrolled and 13 pts were excluded due to inclusion violations. At data cutoff (Feb 24, 2022), 83 pts. (demographics are shown in Table 1) were available for efficacy and safety analysis. The median PFS in group A+D was significantly improved compared with group D [4.36m (95%CI: 2.78‐5.94) vs 1.64m (95%CI: 1.48‐1.80); HR 0.38 (95%CI: 0.22‐0.65), p<0.001)]. The median OS was 11.97m (95%CI: 3.08‐20.86) in group A+D and 10.85m (95%CI: 5.44‐16.26) in group D [HR 0.82 (95%CI: 0.45‐1.47), p=0.501)]. For tumor response, ORR were 35.14% vs 9.52% (p=0.007) and DCR were 83.78% vs 54.76% (p=0.006) in group A+D and group D, respectively. We noted treatment‐related adverse events (TRAEs) of grade 3 or above occurred in in 12 (30.0%) of 40 pts in group A+D safety population and 8 (18.6%) of 43 pts in group D safety population. The most common grade 3 or worse TRAEs were Leucopenia (15.0% vs 7.0%), Neutropenia (10.0% vs 4.7%) in group A+D and group D, respectively. The toxicities in both groups were manageable with appropriate dose reductions and supportive care. Conclusions: The combination of anlotinib plus docetaxel improves survival as second‐line treatment of EGFR wild‐type NSCLC patients in terms of PFS, ORR, DCR, and has a manageable safety profile. It has been proved to be an effective regimen for EGFR wild‐type NSCLC patients progressing after first‐line platinum‐based chemotherapy combined with Immune checkpoint inhibitors.

abstract = {Background: The 5‐year progression free survival (PFS) rate of patients with metastatic, PD‐L1 negative, non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains poor, ranging from approximately2%to 10% with standard immunotherapy‐based treatment regimens. Based on promising antitumor activity in the phase 1 CodeBreaK 101 study, with partial responses observed in 62% (8/13) of PD‐L1 negative patients in the first‐line setting, we hypothesize that sotorasib plus platinum doublet chemotherapy will demonstrate durable clinical response and improved outcomes in this population. CodeBreaK 202 (NCT05920356) is a global phase 3 randomized study evaluating the efficacy of sotorasib versus pembrolizumab in combination with platinum doublet chemotherapy as first‐line treatment for metastatic or locally advanced, PD‐L1 negative, KRAS G12C‐mutated NSCLC. Methods: Patients will be randomized 1:1 to either sotorasib 960 mg once daily or pembrolizumab administered in combination with carboplatin and pemetrexed for 4 cycles, followed by maintenance treatment with sotorasib or pembrolizumab administered in combination with pemetrexed. Key eligibility criteria include treatment‐ naïve metastatic or locally advanced stage IIIB/C disease that is not amenable to definitive chemoradiation, PD‐L1 ,1% expression, presence of KRAS G12C mutation, nonsquamous tumor histology, and absence of actionable genomic alterations such as EGFR mutations and ALK rearrangements. Patients with both treated and untreated brain metastases are eligible if clinically asymptomatic. The primary endpoint is PFS per RECIST v1.1 by blinded independent central review (BICR). Key secondary endpoints include overall survival and objective response rate. Exploratory endpoints include intra‐cranial PFS perRANO‐BMcriteria.

abstract = {Background: Immunotherapy has improved survival in patients (pts) with adv/met NSCLC. However, outcomes remain poor in pts with PD‐L1 expression <50%, and more efficacious treatments are needed. Dato‐DXd is an antibody‐drug conjugate composed of a TROP2 directed monoclonal antibody covalently linked to a highly potent cytotoxic payload via a stable, tumor‐selective, tetrapeptide‐based cleavable linker. In the phase 1b TROPION‐Lung02 trial, Dato‐DXd + pembro ± Pt‐CT had tolerable safety and promising antitumor activity in pts with adv/met NSCLC, notably as 1L therapy and irrespective of PD‐L1 levels. Here, we describe the TROPION‐Lung07 trial of Dato‐DXd + pembro ± Pt‐CT in pts with adv/met NSCLC without actionable genomic alterations (AGA) and PD‐L1 expression <50%. Trial design: TROPION‐Lung07 (NCT05555732) is a global, randomized, open‐label, phase 3 trial of 1L Dato‐DXd + pembro ± Pt‐CT in pts with nonsquamous adv/met NSCLC without AGA with PD‐L1 expression <50%. Dato‐DXd + pembro ± Pt‐CT will be compared with pemetrexed + pembro + Pt‐CT. Approximately 975 pts will be randomized 1:1:1 to Dato‐DXd 6 mg/kg + pembro 200 mg (max, 35 cycles) ± Pt‐CT (cisplatin 75 mg/m2 or carboplatin area under the curve 5; max, 4 cycles) every 3 weeks (Q3W) or pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 + pembro 200 mg + Pt‐CT Q3W. Pts will be stratified by PD‐L1 levels, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, geographic region, and investigator choice of Pt‐CT. Pts must have stage IIIB/C NSCLC ineligible for resection or definitive chemoradiation or stage IV disease and must not have received prior systemic therapy for adv/met NSCLC. The primary endpoints are progression‐free survival by blinded independent central review and overall survival. Secondary endpoints include objective response rate (ORR), duration of response, time to response, disease control rate, and safety. Pt‐reported outcomes, pharmacokinetics, and biomarkers will be explored. Enrollment is currently ongoing in the United States, Australia, China, Japan, Republic of Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand.

abstract = {Background: Mutations in KRAS are among the most frequent oncogenic drivers with the G12C variant found in ∼13% of NSCLC. Outcomes for KRAS G12C‐mutant NSCLC may be improved by combining KRAS G12C inhibitors with current 1L standard of care (SOC). Olomorasib is a potent and highly selective second‐generation inhibitor of KRAS G12C, which delivers.90%sustained target occupancy in preclinical models. In the LOXO‐RAS‐20001 phase 1/2 study, olomorasib in combination with pembrolizumab demonstrated preliminary efficacy and a favorable safety profile.1 Methods: SUNRAY‐01 (NCT06119581) is a pivotal, global, phase 3 study in 1L advanced KRAS G12C‐mutated NSCLC designed to seamlessly 1) optimize the dosing of olomorasib in combination with 1L SOC, and then 2) compare efficacy and safety of olomorasib plus SOC with placebo plus SOC. In the open‐label randomized dose optimization (pembrolizumab plus olomorasib 50 mg vs 100 mg BID) and single arm safety lead‐in (olomorasib plus pembrolizumab, pemetrexed, platinum), the optimal dose of olomorasib for combination therapy will be determined before the phase 3 study (parts A and B) is opened for enrollment. In part A, 384 participants with PD‐L1 expression ≥50% are randomized (1:1) to pembrolizumab plus olomorasib or placebo. In part B, 552 participants are randomized (1:1) to pembrolizumab, pemetrexed, platinum plus olomorasib or placebo regardless of PD‐L1 expression. Allocation of participants with PD‐L1 expression≥50% to either part A or part B will be at the discretion of the investigator. The primary objective is to compare efficacy based on PFS per RECIST v1.1 by blinded independent central review. Secondary endpoints include OS, ORR, DOR, DCR, TTR, PFS2, safety and tolerability, and patient‐reported outcomes. Eligible participants (≥18 years) must have a KRAS G12C mutation in tumor or blood and known PD‐L1 expression (0‐100%), stage IIIB, IIIC, or IV NSCLC not suitable for curative intent radical surgery or radiation therapy, measurable disease per RECIST v1.1, and an ECOG PS 0‐1. Participants can be enrolled based on local KRAS and PD‐L1 testing results. Participants should not have received prior systemic therapy for advanced or metastatic NSCLC, however 1 cycle of SOC treatment prior to enrollment is allowed if immediate treatment is clinically indicated. Participants with asymptomatic (lesions≤1.5 cm) or previously treated radiographically stable brain metastases are eligible. Key exclusion criteria include history of pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease and clinically significant active cardiovascular disease or malabsorption syndrome. The study opened for enrollment in December 2023. 1Murciano‐Goroff et al. 2023 Cancer Res 83 (8 Suppl): CT028.},

Chemotherapy treatment regimens are outlined in Table 5. Patients will also receive durvalumab 1500 mg or placebo every 4 weeks via intravenous infusion concurrent with SoC CRT (ie, starting on Cycle 1 Day 1 [±3 days]). Patients with complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or SD following completion of SoC CRT will continue to receive durvalumab/placebo as consolidation treatment.

Any patient not known to have died at the time of analysis will be censored based on the last recorded date on which the patient was known to be alive. ; Note: Survival calls will be made in the week following the date of DCO for the analysis. (These contacts should generally occur within 7 days of the DCO.) If patients are confirmed to be alive or if the death date is after the DCO date, these patients will be censored at the date of DCO. Death dates may be found by checking publicly available death registries. ; ; NAME OF THE RESULT: Rate of complete response ; USED MEASURING METHOD :The rate of CR (per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR) is defined as the number (%) of patients with at least 1 visit response of CR. Data obtained up until progression, or the last evaluable assessment in the absence of progression, will be included in the assessment of rate of CR. Patients who go off treatment without progression, receive a subsequent therapy, and then respond will not be included as responders in the rate of CR. ; PERIOD OF TIME WHERE THE MEASUREMENT WILL BE CONDUCTED AND WHICH WILL ALLOW OBTAINING THE SECONDARY RESULT: DoR (per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR) will be defined as the time from the date of first documented response until the first date of documented progression or death in the absence of disease progression (ie, date of PFS event or censoring – date of first response+1). The end of response should coincide with the date of progression or death from any cause used for the RECIST 1.1 PFS endpoint. ; The time of the initial response will be defined as the latest of the dates contributing toward the first visit response of CR or PR. If a patient does not progress following a response, then his or her DoR will be censored at the PFS censoring time.

Patients who have not progressed or died at the time of analysis will be censored at the time of the latest date of assessment from their last evaluable RECIST 1.1 assessment. However, if the patient progresses or dies after 2 or more missed visits, the patient will be censored at the time of the latest evaluable RECIST 1.1 assessment prior to the 2 missed visits. If the patient has no evaluable visits or does not have baseline data, he or she will be censored at Day 1 unless he or she dies within 2 visits of baseline, then they will be treated as an event with date of death as the event date.; PERIOD OF TIME WHERE THE MEASUREMENT WILL BE CONDUCTED AND WHICH WILL ALLOW OBTAINING THE PRIMARY RESULT: The PFS time will always be derived based on scan/assessment dates and not visit dates.; RECIST 1.1 assessments/scans contributing toward a particular visit may be performed on different dates. The following rules will be applied:; • For BICR assessments, the date of progression will be determined based on the earliest scan dates of the component that triggered the progression for the adjudicated reviewer selecting PD or of the reviewer who read baseline first if there is no adjudication.; • For Investigator assessments, the date of progression will be determined based on the earliest of the RECIST 1.1 assessment/scan dates of the component that indicates progression.; • When censoring a patient for PFS, the patient will be censored at the latest of the scan dates contributing to a particular overall visit assessment.; Note: For TLs, only the latest scan date within an imaging visit window is recorded in the RECIST 1.1 eCRF out of all scans performed at that assessment for the TLs, and similarly for NTLs, only the latest scan date is recorded out of all scans performed at that assessment for the NTLs.; A sensitivity analysis of PFS will be performed using Investigator assessments according to RECIST 1.1.; 4.

abstract = {Purpose/Objective(s): TG4010 immunotherapy product is a poxvirus (MVA) coding for MUC1 tumor‐associated antigen and interleukin‐2. A previous study showed that a normal baseline level of Triple Positive Activated Lymphocytes (TrPAL, CD16+CD56+CD69+) might be a predictive biomarker for TG4010 efficacy in NSCLC. TIME is a double‐blind phase 2b/3 study (NCT01383148) comparing the combination of first line therapy with TG4010 or placebo. The phase 2b part aims at prospectively validating the baseline TrPAL level as a predictive biomarker. Materials/Methods: Primary endpoint of the phase 2b part of the study was to compare progression‐free survival (PFS, according to RECIST 1.1) between TG4010 and placebo arms using a Bayesian design, in stage IV NSCLC patients with a MUC1 expressing tumor by immunohistochemistry. Secondary objectives were response rate, safety, survival and subgroup analyses according to stratification factors and level of TrPAL at baseline. A dynamic minimization procedure was applied at randomization for histology, prescription of bevacizumab, type of chemotherapy, performance status, and center. Results: Two hundred seventeen patients have been enrolled out of which 170 patients with a normal TrPAL level (predetermined threshold) and an analysis of PFS was conducted in this cohort after 137 events of progression were recorded. The hazard ratio (HR) for PFS is 0.76 (95%CI: 0.54‐1.06). This corresponds to a 97.5% Bayesian probability that the true HR is <1, passing the threshold of 95% needed to consider the endpoint met in patients with normal TrPAL. TG4010 related adverse events were limited to mild or moderate fever and injection site reaction. Analysis in the 75% of patients with the lowest baseline level of TrPAL (3 lowest quartiles, n=152) shows a HR for PFS of 0.72 (95%CI: 0.50‐1.03) consistent with the observation made in the previous study. Additional preplanned analyses by subgroup show that patients with nonsquamous tumors had a statistically significant improvement in PFS when treated with TG4010 (n=145, HR=0.67; CI: 0.46‐0.97; P=.016) and especially when belonging to the 3 lowest quartiles (n=131, HR=0.63; 95% CI: 0.42‐ 0.93, P=.009). Overall survival data of the phase 2b part will be presented at the time of the meeting. Conclusions: These data support the predictive value of the TrPAL biomarker. They also confirm TG4010 efficacy and safety profile in stage IV NSCLC patients and warrant the continuation of the TIME study phase 3 part with overall survival as a primary endpoint.},

Methods: RTOG 0617 (NCT00533949) randomized standard (SD, 60 Gy) versus high‐dose (HD, 74 Gy) CCRT +/‐ cetuximab from 11/07‐06/11. This analysis includes 469 patients (pts) given ≥50 Gy. A PFS event was defined as the first occurrence of local, regional, distant PD or death w/o documented PD. A CTA‐PFS event was the first occurrence of grade 2+ treatment‐related cardiac toxicity event or a PFS event. Landmark analyses at 6mo and 12mo were used to minimize the immortal time bias. Cox model with PD or CT/PD as a time‐dependent covariate was used to evaluate their predictive roles. Median f/u time for surviving pts was 5.1 years. Results: As reported, pts treated with HD had significantly lower OS rates (HR = 1.28, 95%CI: 1.04‐1.58, p = 0.018) and CTA‐PFS rates (HR = 1.24, 95%CI: 1.02‐1.51, p = 0.035), and marginally lower PFS rates (HR = 1.21, 95%CI: 0.99‐1.47, p = 0.06) than pts treated with SD. Median survival time (MST) among pts having PD within 6mo versus not were 13.4mo (95%CI: 10.0‐19.0) and 30.7mo (95%CI: 28.0‐37.0) (p < 0.001). MST for pts having PD within 12mo versus not were 20.6mo (95%CI: 18.8‐25.0) and 60mo (95%CI: 47.6‐74.5)(p < 0.001). Results are similar when using CTA‐PFS with 6mo or 12mo cutoff (p < 0.001). RT dose was no longer significantly associated with OS (p = 0.08 or p = 0.15) when PD or CT/PD was included in multivariable analysis (p < 0.001), suggesting OS differences in HD/SD may be partially captured by PFS or CTA‐PFS. Conclusions: RTOG 0617 survival results suggest that PFS (or CTA‐PFS) status at 6mo or 12mo predicts long‐term OS, and may potentially be considered as a surrogate endpoint of OS in clinical trials. Pts who were progression‐free at 12mo had a MST of 5 years. Further validation on external datasets and in the modern era of immunotherapy are needed.},

abstract = {The use of four cycles of cisplatin‐based adjuvant chemotherapy is now the standard of care for patients with resected stage II and IIIA NSCLC and is commonly used for patients with larger (at least 4 cm in size) stage IB tumors. The survival benefit with adjuvant chemotherapy though is limited with meta‐analyses revealing a 4‐5% absolute survival benefit at 5 years for patients receiving adjuvant cisplatin‐based chemotherapy.1,2 Some recent attempts to improve outcomes with the addition of other agents to cisplatin doublets (or as longer term therapy) have been disappointing. The addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy in the ECOGACRIN E1505 adjuvant trial failed to show a benefit in disease free survival (DFS) or overall survival (OS).3 The use of the MAGE‐A3 vaccine in the MAGRIT trial was similarly negative.4 With knowledge about molecular drivers of NSCLC and targeted treatment options in advanced disease, multiple studies are either completed or underway to study molecularly targeted agents in earlier stages of lung cancer, particularly with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). In metastatic NSCLC the EGFR TKIs produce superior response and progression free survival (PFS) compared with platinum doublet chemotherapy in treatment naïve patients with tumors with activating EGFR mutations (EGFRmut).5,6 Similar outcomes with significant response and PFS improvements with the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitor crizotinib compared to chemotherapy have been reported in patients with tumors harboring translocations of ALK Encouraging data from retrospective and non‐randomized trials looking at adjuvant EGFR TKI use led to randomized trials. Earlier trials that did not select based on EGFRmut status were negative, but more recent trials have been more encouraging. The phase III RADIANT trial selected patients with resected early stage NSCLC for EGFR expression by IHC/FISH, but not by EGFR mutation status, and randomized them to adjuvant erlotinib or placebo.8 The primary end point was DFS in the full data set, with secondary analyses focused on patients with tumors harboring del19 or L858R EGFR mutations. No differences were found in DFS or OS based on treatment arm for the nearly 1000 patients who were enrolled. In the EGFRmut subset (N=161) DFS did favor erlotinib (HR 0.61, 95% CI = 0.384‐0.981, p = 0.0391), but this was not considered statistically significant, as the primary endpoint of the trial was negative. The overall survival results, while still immature, were not in favor of the erlotinib arm, even in the EGFRmut subset. The conclusion from this study is that adjuvant EGFR TKI therapy requires further investigation and should not be considered a standard treatment option at this time. Multiple ongoing trials are exploring adjuvant EGFR TKI (and adjuvant ALK TKI) therapy for resected early stage NSCLC patients with tumors harboring the appropriate molecular marker. (Table 1) The ongoing trials are looking not only at whether or not an OS benefit can be obtained with adjuvant molecularly targeted therapy but also duration of therapy and the potential to use EGFR TKIs instead of chemotherapy in selected patients. The largest United States study is the NCI National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) ALCHEMIST trial. The study is open to patients with resected early stage (IB‐IIIA) NSCLC who are screened for EGFR activating mutations and ALK translocations. Patients with tumors harboring EGFR mutations or ALK translocations enter the appropriate sub‐study and, after completion of all planned adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy, are randomized to targeted TKI therapy or placebo for 2 years. Both sub‐studies will enroll approximately 400 patients (410 EGFR; 378 ALK) and are powered for an OS endpoint. Patients without actionable mutations can enroll on the ANVIL sub‐study looking at adjuvant nivolumab, a PD‐1 targeted agent. (Table 1) Globally most targeted therapy adjuvant trials are being conducted in Asia, particularly China and Japan. ADJUVANT (C‐TONG 1104) trial in China and IMPACT WJOG6410L in Japan are phase III trials for patients with resected stage II‐IIIA EGFRmut NSCLC comparing gefitinib to cisplatin/vinorelbine using DFS as the primary endpoint. (Table 1) Other trials outlined in the Table are exploring variations on this theme using gefitinib or icotinib and either after or instead of adjuvant chemotherapy. The PD‐1 inhibitors nivolumab and pembrolizumab are approved for the second line treatment of advanced stage NSCLC and will likely be utilized in first‐line in the near future.9‐11 Based on their promise in advanced stage NSCLC, multiple trials with PD‐1 and PD‐L1 agents are ongoing. Most studies are for patients who have completed adjuvant chemotherapy (though some allow chemotherapy naïve patients) and they predominantly randomize patients to approximately 1 year of PD‐1 or PD‐L1 inhibitor therapy. Most include testing for PD‐L1 expression, but do not exclude patients with low tumor levels of PD‐L1. Many are placebo controlled. (Table 1) Chemotherapy has helped improve outcomes but continued investigations with novel approaches will be necessary to continue to improve cure rates for patients with resected early stage NSCLC. The use of molecularly targeted agents for patients with tumors containing EGFRmut or ALK translocations are promising with validation studies ongoing and the hope of immunotherapy is being investigated as well in multiple global trials.},

abstract = {Background: Overall survival (OS) is the gold standard for LA‐NSCLC with chemoradiation (CCRT), while the complex relationships among RT dosimetry, systemic therapies, cardiopulmonary toxicity, progression (PD) and OS are also of increasing scientific and clinical interest. Method: NRG Oncology RTOG 0617 (NCT00533949) was a randomized phase 3 trial comparing standard (SD, 60 Gy) versus high‐dose (HD, 74 Gy) CCRT +/‐ cetuximab from 11/07‐06/11. This secondary analysis includes 469 patients (pts) given ≥50 Gy. A PFS event was defined as the first occurrence of local, regional, distant PD or death w/o documented PD. A CTA‐PFS event was the first occurrence of grade 2+ treatment‐related cardiac toxicity event or a PFS event. Landmark analyses at 6mo and 12mo were used to minimize the immortal time bias. Cox model with PD or CT/PD as a time‐dependent covariate was used to evaluate their predictive roles. Median f/u time for surviving pts was 5.1 years.

abstract = {Background: Along with improving efficacy outcomes such as progression‐free survival (PFS) after concurrent chemoradiotherapy (cCRT) in locally advanced, unresectable NSCLC, it is critical that new therapies are well tolerated in the curative intent setting. We studied the impact of 12 mo of durvalumab on disease symptoms in this setting using patient‐reported outcomes (PROs). In a post‐hoc analysis of time to deterioration, we adjusted for transient symptom changes by requiring two consecutive deterioration recordings. Methods: Patients whose disease did not progress after ≥2 cycles of platinum‐based cCRT were randomised 2:1 1‐42 days post‐cCRT to durvalumab 10 mg/kg i.v. or placebo every 2 weeks for up to 12 mo/progression. Coprimary endpoints were PFS and overall survival. PROs were assessed using EORTC QLQ‐C30 v3 and QLQ‐LC13. Time to deterioration was defined as time from randomisation until the first clinically relevant deterioration (≥10 point change); in the post‐hoc analysis, deterioration confirmation was required at the next time point. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using a stratified Cox proportional‐hazards model. Results: In the pre‐specified analysis, there was no difference between treatment arms in time to deterioration besides other pain, which favoured durvalumab vs placebo (HR 0.72; 95% CI 0.58‐0.89). Our post‐hoc analysis indicated notable delays in deterioration of overall pain (HR 0.75; 95% CI 0.60‐0.93), chest pain (HR 0.74; 95% CI 0.57‐0.97), arm/shoulder pain (HR 0.74; 95% CI 0.58‐0.95), nausea/vomiting (HR 0.72; 95% CI 0.54‐0.97), insomnia (HR 0.75; 95% CI 0.58‐0.97) and haemoptysis (HR 0.70; 95% CI 0.50‐0.99) in favour of durvalumab, with no between‐group differences for other items. Conclusions: PACIFIC primary analysis showed that durvalumab significantly improved PFS vs placebo (16.8 mo vs 5.6 mo, respectively) in the post‐cCRT setting, and waswell tolerated, largely without PRO deterioration. Our post‐hoc analysis indicates a delay in several PROs with durvalumab not observed in the pre‐specified analysis. Confirmation of worsening may provide a more precise picture of deterioration than one time point alone.},

abstract = {Purpose/Objective(s): Nivolumab, a fully human IgG4 programmed death‐1 (PD‐1) immune checkpoint inhibitor antibody, has demonstrated durable responses and tolerability in chemotherapy‐naïve and heavily pretreated patients (pts) with NSCLC. BEV has shown tolerability and enhanced activity in combination with the CTLA‐4 immune checkpoint antibody ipilimumab in melanoma. We report preliminary results from a phase 1 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of switching to nivolumab maintenance therapy, as monotherapy or combined with BEV, in pts with advanced NSCLC who did not progress on first‐line platinum (PT) based chemotherapy. Materials/Methods: Pts with no progression within 42 days of completing ≥4 cycles first‐line PT‐based chemotherapy (± BEV) were assigned to either nivolumab (N) 5 mg/kg IV Q3W + BEV 15 mg/kg IV Q3W (nonsquamous [non‐sq] pts only; n=12) or N 3 mg/kg IV Q2W monotherapy (sq arm [n=8], non‐sq arm [n=13]) until progression or unacceptable toxicity (treatment beyond progression allowed based on protocol‐defined criteria). Objective response rate (ORR) was evaluated using RECIST 1.1. Results: Median follow‐up was 80.4, 25.6, and 35.1 wks for N + BEV, N monotherapy in sq pts, and N monotherapy in non‐sq pts. Any‐grade treatment‐related adverse events (AEs) occurred in 11/12 (92%) pts switching to N + BEV and in 13/21 (62%) pts switching to N monotherapy (managed with standard algorithms). No treatment‐related grade 4 AEs were reported; grade 3 AEs included pneumonitis (n=2) and cough and tubulointerstitial nephritis (n=1 each) with N + BEV; and pneumonitis (n=2) and pleural effusion (n=1) with N monotherapy. Four pts in each of the N + BEV and N monotherapy (non‐sq) arms discontinued due to treatment‐related AEs. Median progression‐free survival (PFS) was 37.1 wks with N + BEV, 16 wks with sq N monotherapy and 21.4 wks with non‐sq N monotherapy. ORR with N + BEV was 8% (1/12, ongoing). ORR with N monotherapy was 10% (2/21; both non‐sq, duration of responses 15.7 and 18.3 wks). Stable disease was best overall response in 50% with N + BEV and 48% with N monotherapy (50% sq, 46% non‐sq). Median overall survival (OS) was not reached with N + BEV (range 33.3, 86.7+ wks) or N monotherapy (range 2.1+, 56.3+ wks); 1‐yr OS rate was 75% with N + BEV (not calculated for N monotherapy [insufficient follow‐up]). Conclusions: Switching to nivolumab either as monotherapy or + BEV demonstrated PFS similar to that seen with other agents approved as maintenance therapy after PT‐based chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC. These preliminary data support further evaluation of the safety and efficacy of switching to nivolumab maintenance therapy in chemotherapy‐treated pts. Additional follow‐up will be presented.},

abstract = {Background Mecbotamab vedotin (BA3011) is a conditionally active biologic (CAB) anti‐AXL antibody‐drug conjugate being developed as an anticancer therapy for patients with advanced solid tumors. Conditional and reversible binding by CABs is designed to reduce off‐tumor toxicity and immunogenicity, avoid tissue‐mediated drug disposition, and improve pharmacokinetics. AXL is a cell‐surface transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase highly expressed in several tumor types including sarcoma. Increased AXL expression has been associated with tumor resistance to chemotherapy, programmed death‐1 (PD‐1) inhibitors, molecular targeted therapy, and radiation therapy. The upregulation of AXL in PD‐1 resistant tumor strongly suggests its role in resistance and recurrence in this population. Additionally, as patients who have experienced failure of either an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitor have been shown to achieve minimal benefit with subsequent exposure to PD‐1 monotherapy, there is considerable additional rationale for use of BA3011‐based therapy. Trial design Study BA3011‐002 is an ongoing multi‐center, open‐label, phase II trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BA3011 alone or in combination with nivolumab in patients with AXL‐expressing (tumor membrane percent score ≥ 1%), metastatic NSCLC who have measurable disease by RECIST version 1.1 criteria. To enroll, patients must have experienced failure of an approved programmed death1/ ligand‐1(PD‐1/L1) treatment, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitor (either monotherapy or in combination with another therapy such as ipilimumab). Treatment failure is defined as disease progression on a PD‐1/L1, EGFR, or ALK inhibitor, or discontinuation of a PD‐1/L1, EGFR, or ALK inhibitor due to an adverse event. Enrollment completion is anticipated in 2023. Clinical trial identification NCT04681131, EudraCT 2022‐000135‐23. Legal entity responsible for the study BioAtla, Inc. Funding BioAtla, Inc.

abstract = {Background: Historically, the standard‐of‐care for patients (pts) with unresectable stage III NSCLC was CCRT; however, outcomes are poor with 5‐y survival rates of 15–30%. While CCRT primes anti‐tumour immunity, it also upregulates PD‐L1 expression, potentially blunting any immune response. Thus, concurrent immunotherapy + CCRT may improve outcomes. The safety and tolerability of NIVO, an anti–PD‐1 antibody, given concomitantly with CCRT in pts with stage III NSCLC was demonstrated in the phase 2 NICOLAS study (NCT02434081). Furthermore, combining NIVO with IPI, an anti–CTLA‐4 antibody, resulted in a longer median overall survival (OS) versus chemotherapy in pts with advanced NSCLC who had a PD‐L1 expression level of ≥1% in the phase 3 CheckMate 227 study (NCT02477826). In a prespecified exploratory analysis, NIVO + IPI showed an efficacy benefit versus NIVO. Previously, DURV, an anti–PD‐L1 antibody, demonstrated significant improvements versus placebo in progression‐free survival (PFS) and OS with manageable safety in pts without disease progression after CCRT in the phase 3 PACIFIC study (NCT02125461). Therefore, we will evaluate the efficacy of NIVO + CCRT followed by NIVO ± IPI versus CCRT followed by DURV for untreated, LA stage III NSCLC in the phase 3 randomized CheckMate 73L study (NCT04026412). Trial design: In all, 888 pts aged ≥18 y with previously untreated stage III NSCLC and an ECOG PS ≤1 will be stratified by age, PD‐L1 expression, and disease stage, then randomized (1:1:1) to receive NIVO (360 mg Q3W) + CCRT followed by NIVO (360 mg Q3W) + IPI (1 mg/kg Q6W; Arm A) or NIVO alone (480 mg Q4W; Arm B) for ≤1 y, or CCRT followed by DURV (10 mg/kg Q2W; Arm C) for ≤1 y. Pts with PD during CCRT will discontinue treatment and enter follow‐up. Primary endpoints are PFS by RECIST 1.1, assessed by BICR (Arm A vs C) and OS (Arm A vs C). Secondary endpoints are PFS (Arm B vs A or C), OS (Arm B vs A or C), objective response rate, time to response, duration of response, time to distant metastases, and safety. Start date: Aug 2019.

abstract = {Background: The 5‐year progression free survival (PFS) rate of patients with metastatic, PD‐L1 negative, non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains poor, ranging from approximately 2% to 10% with standard immunotherapy‐based treatment regimens. Based on promising anti‐tumor activity in the phase I CodeBreaK 101 study, with partial responses observed in 62% (8/13) of PD‐L1 negative patients in the first‐line setting, we hypothesize that sotorasib plus platinum doublet chemotherapy will demonstrate durable clinical response and improved outcomes in this population. CodeBreaK 202 (NCT05920356) is a global phase III randomized study evaluating the efficacy of sotorasib versus pembrolizumab in combination with platinum doublet chemotherapy as first‐line treatment for metastatic or locally advanced, PD‐L1 negative, KRAS G12C‐mutated NSCLC. Trial design: Patients will be randomized 1:1 to either sotorasib 960 mg once daily or pembrolizumab administered in combination with carboplatin and pemetrexed for 4 cycles, followed by maintenance treatment with sotorasib or pembrolizumab administered in combination with pemetrexed. Key eligibility criteria include treatment‐naïve metastatic or locally advanced stage IIIB/C disease that is not amenable to definitive chemoradiation, PD‐L1 <1% expression, presence of KRAS G12C mutation, non‐squamous tumor histology, and absence of actionable genomic alterations such as EGFR mutations and ALK rearrangements. Patients with both treated and untreated brain metastases are eligible if clinically asymptomatic. The primary endpoint is PFS per RECIST v1.1 by blinded independent central review (BICR). Key secondary endpoints include overall survival and objective response rate. Exploratory endpoints include intra‐cranial PFS per RANO‐BM criteria.

abstract = {Background: The anti‐PD‐L1 mAb atezo blocks the interaction between PD‐L1 and its receptors PD‐1 and B7.1 and restores anti‐tumor immunity. In the OAK trial, pts with 2L/3L advanced NSCLC had improved mOS in the atezo arm (13.8 mo) vs the docetaxel (doc) arm (9.6 mo), with a survival benefit observed regardless of PD‐L1 expression levels on tumor cells (TC) or tumor‐infiltrating immune cells (IC). However, more effective treatment options are needed for pts with early‐stage NSCLC. A global Phase III, randomized, open‐label trial, IMpower010 (NCT02486718), is being conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of atezo vs BSC following adjuvant cisplatin (cis)‐based chemotherapy (chemo) in pts with resected stage IB (tumors ≥ 4 cm)‐IIIA NSCLC. Methods: Pts eligible for study must have complete tumor resection 4 to 12 weeks prior to enrollment for pathologic stage IB (tumors ≥ 4 cm)‐IIIA NSCLC, be adequately recovered from surgery, be able to receive cis‐based adjuvant chemo and have an ECOG PS 0‐1. Pts with other malignancies, autoimmune disease, hormonal cancer or radiation therapy within 5 years and prior chemo or immunotherapy are excluded from study. Approximately 1127 pts will be enrolled regardless of PD‐L1 status. Pts will receive up to four 21‐d cycles of cis‐based chemo (cis [75 mg/m2IV, d 1] + vinorelbine [30 mg/m2IV, d 1, 8], doc [75 mg/m IV, d 1] or gemcitabine [1250 mg/m2IV, d 1, 8], or pemetrexed [500 mg/m2IV, d 1; only non‐squamous NSCLC]). No adjuvant radiation therapy is permitted. After adjuvant chemo, eligible pts will be randomized 1:1 to receive 16 cycles of atezo 1200 mg q3w or BSC. Stratification factors include sex, histology (squamous vs non‐squamous), disease stage (IB vs II vs IIA) and PD‐L1 status by IHC (TC2/3 [≥ 5% expressing PD‐L1] and any IC vs TC0/1 [ < 5%] and IC2/3 vs TC0/1 and IC0/1 [ < 5%]). The primary endpoint is disease‐free survival; secondary endpoints include OS and safety. Exploratory biomarkers, including PD‐L1 expression, immune‐ and tumor‐related biomarkers before, during and after treatment with atezo and at radiographic disease recurrence, or confirmation of new primary NSCLC, will be evaluated.},

abstract = {Background: First line therapy options for advanced NSCLC without actionable molecular alterations include immunotherapy (IO) ‐/+ chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone. NRGLU002 was a randomized phase II/III study assessing the benefits of local consolidative therapy (LCT) when added to systemic therapy as maintenance in management of oligometastatic NSCLC. Methods: Eligible patients had metastatic NSCLC with 3 or fewer extracranial metastatic sites (excluding primary) exhibiting at least stable disease after 4 cycles of 1st line systemic therapy. Patients were randomized 1:2 to maintenance systemic therapy or LCT (radiation and/or surgery) followed by maintenance systemic therapy until progression, death, or intolerable toxicity. Stratification factors included histology and IO use. In the randomized phase II (RPhII) portion of the study, the primary endpoint was progression‐free survival (PFS) with a planned decision analysis after 216 patients were enrolled and 138 PFS events observed. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), quality of life, and toxicity. The RPhII portion was designed to provide at least 95% power to detect a PFS hazard ratio (HR) of 0.60 at 1‐sided significance level of 0.15, and the phase III portion warranted only if the estimated HR was less than 0.83. Results: NRG‐LU002 accrual was initiated in 4/2017 and suspended in 11/ 2021 when the RPhII portion sample size was met. Following the planned interim analysis, the study was closed in 12/2023. Overall, 215 patients (81 ‐LCT arm, 134 +LCT arm) were enrolled from 68 sites with a median age of 65 years (40‐86), 77% white, 95% PS 0/1, 78% nonsquamous histology, and 90% having received IO‐based systemic therapy. Median follow‐up among all/surviving patients were 21.9/29.4 months, respectively. With 138 PFS events from both arms, estimated 1‐yr and 2‐yr PFS rates were 48% (95% CI: 35.9, 59.0) and 36% (95% CI: 24.8, 47.2) in the maintenance systemic therapy arm and 52% (95% CI: 42.5, 59.8) and 40% (95% CI: 31.5, 48.6) in the LCT + maintenance systemic therapy arm, respectively (2‐sided logrank test p‐value = 0.66). Corresponding HR was 0.93 (95% CI: 0.66, 1.31). Of 185 patients treated with IO‐containing regimens, the PFS HR was 0.90 (95% CI: 0.61, 1.32). OS HR between two arms was 1.05 (0.70, 1.56) among all patients and 1.05 (0.68, 1.63) among IO‐treated patients. For adverse events reported as definitely, probably or possibly related to treatment, there were more LCT + maintenance systemic therapy patients with overall grade 2 or higher toxicities (73% vs 84%) and grade 3 or higher pneumonitis (1% vs 10%). Conclusions: LCT added to IO‐based 1st line systemic therapy was associated with a PFS HR of 0.90. Reducing toxicity and increasing biologically‐driven patient selection may optimize this therapeutic ratio.},

abstract = {Background: Mutations in KRAS are among the most frequent oncogenic drivers with the G12C variant found in ∼13% of NSCLC. Outcomes for KRAS G12C‐mutant NSCLC may be improved by combining KRAS G12C inhibitors with current 1L standard of care (SOC). Olomorasib is a potent and highly selective second‐generation inhibitor of KRAS G12C, which delivers >90%sustained target occupancy in preclinical models. In the LOXO‐RAS‐20001 phase 1/2 study, olomorasib in combination with pembrolizumab demonstrated preliminary efficacy and a favorable safety profile >1 Methods: SUNRAY‐01 (NCT06119581) is a pivotal, global, phase 3 study in 1L advanced KRAS G12C‐mutated NSCLC designed to seamlessly 1) optimize the dosing of olomorasib in combination with 1L SOC, and then 2) compare efficacy and safety of olomorasib plus SOC with placebo plus SOC. In the open‐label randomized dose optimization (pembrolizumab plus olomorasib 50 mg vs 100 mg BID) and single arm safety lead‐in (olomorasib plus pembrolizumab, pemetrexed, platinum), the optimal dose of olomorasib for combination therapy will be determined before the phase 3 study (parts A and B) is opened for enrollment. In part A, 384 participants with PD‐L1 expression ≥50% are randomized (1:1) to pembrolizumab plus olomorasib or placebo. In part B, 552 participants are randomized (1:1) to pembrolizumab, pemetrexed, platinum plus olomorasib or placebo regardless of PD‐L1 expression. Allocation of participants with PD‐L1 expression≥50% to either part A or part B will be at the discretion of the investigator. The primary objective is to compare efficacy based on PFS per RECIST v1.1 by blinded independent central review. Secondary endpoints include OS, ORR, DOR, DCR, TTR, PFS2, safety and tolerability, and patient‐reported outcomes. Eligible participants (≥18 years) must have a KRAS G12C mutation in tumor or blood and known PD‐L1 expression (0‐100%), stage IIIB, IIIC, or IV NSCLC not suitable for curative intent radical surgery or radiation therapy, measurable disease per RECIST v1.1, and an ECOG PS 0‐1. Participants can be enrolled based on local KRAS and PD‐L1 testing results. Participants should not have received prior systemic therapy for advanced or metastatic NSCLC, however 1 cycle of SOC treatment prior to enrollment is allowed if immediate treatment is clinically indicated. Participants with asymptomatic (lesions≤1.5 cm) or previously treated radiographically stable brain metastases are eligible. Key exclusion criteria include history of pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease and clinically significant active cardiovascular disease or malabsorption syndrome.},

abstract = {Background: In patients with resected, stage II‐III NSCLC, the 5‐year disease‐free survival (DFS) rate with SoC adjuvant chemotherapy is 40%. Despite advances with immunotherapy (IO) in the metastatic setting, overall survival (OS) rates for patients with recurrence remain low. Detection of minimal residual disease (MRD), as indicated by circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), may indicate the presence of clinically indiscernible residual tumor following curative‐intent therapy and enable earlier therapeutic intervention, thereby improving outcomes in patients at highest risk of recurrence. In the phase III PACIFIC trial, consolidation durvalumab improved survival outcomes in patients with unresectable, stage III NSCLC without detectable disease progression after curative‐intent chemoradiotherapy (Antonia, 2018), suggesting MRD is vulnerable to additional therapy, particularly IO, a concept supported by recent data in MRD+ patients (Moding, 2020). MERMAID‐2 will assess the efficacy and safety of durvalumab, versus placebo, in patients with resected, stage II‐III NSCLC who become MRD+ after curative‐intent therapy. Trial design: MERMAID‐2 (NCT04642469) is a global, phase III, double‐blind multicenter study that is currently recruiting patients. Patients with histologically confirmed EGFR/ALK wild‐type stage II‐III NSCLC who have completed curative‐intent therapy (complete resection + optional neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant therapy) will be enrolled in a 96‐week surveillance period. During this period, patients will be monitored regularly for MRD emergence via ctDNA analysis of plasma samples, based on personalized MRD panels. Patients who become MRD+ during the surveillance period will be further evaluated to confirm eligibility (no disease recurrence visible on imaging; known PD‐L1 status) and 284 MRD+ patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive durvalumab 1500 mg IV or placebo q4w, up to 24 months or until investigator‐assessed disease recurrence. The primary endpoint is DFS in patients with PD–L1 tumor cell expression ≥1%. Secondary endpoints include DFS in the full analysis set, progression‐free survival, OS, time to subsequent therapy, patient‐reported outcomes, and safety. Clinical trial identification: NCT04642469.

abstract = {Background: The programmed death‐1 receptor (PD‐1) and its ligand (PD‐L1) are key therapeutic targets in the reactivation of the immune response against multiple cancers. Avelumab∗ (MSB0010718C) is a fully human antiPD‐L1 IgG1 antibody currently being investigated in clinical trials. The primary objective of this phase Ib, open‐label expansion study (NCT01772004) was to assess the safety and tolerability of avelumab in patients (pts) with locally advanced or metastatic (LA/M) solid tumors. Methods: Pts from 16 different expansion cohorts (including NSCLC, gastric, ovarian, urothelial, and breast; ECOG performance status [PS] of 01 at trial entry) and unselected for PD‐L1 expression were treated with avelumab at 10 mg/kg IV, Q2W until confirmed progression, unacceptable toxicity, or any criteria for withdrawal occurred. Adverse events (AEs) were graded by NCI‐CTCAE v4.0. Results: As of Aug 4, 2015, 900 pts were treated with avelumab and followed for ?4 wks. Median age was 62 years (range, 23‐91), ECOG PS was 0 (39.1%), 1 (60.6%), or 23 (0.2%), and median number of prior lines of anticancer therapy was 2 (range, 113). Median duration of treatment with avelumab and number of administrations were 10.0 wks (range, 292) and 5 infusions (range, 143), respectively. Treatment‐related (TR) AEs of any grade occurred in 585 pts (65.0%). Grade ?3 TRAEs occurred in 91 pts (10.1%). The most frequent (?0.5%) grade ?3 TRAEs were IRRs (n = 8, 0.9%), GGT elevation (n = 7, 0.8%), lipase elevation (n = 7, 0.8%), anemia (n = 7, 0.8%), and fatigue (n = 6, 0.7%). Seventyfive pts (8.3%) experienced potential immune‐related (ir) TRAEs, with hypothyroidism (n = 34, 3.8%) and pneumonitis (n = 8, 0.9%) occurring most frequently (?0.5%). Grade ?3 potential irTRAEs were reported for 17 pts (1.9%); the most frequent (?0.3%) were autoimmune hepatitis (n = 4; 0.4%), colitis (n = 3; 0.3%), and pneumonitis (n = 3; 0.3%). TRAEs resulted in permanent treatment discontinuation for 64 pts (7.1%); 2.6% (n = 23) discontinued due to an IRR and 1.3% (n = 12) discontinued due to a potential irTRAE. TRAEs were considered the primary cause of death by the investigator for 4 pts (0.4%): radiation pneumonitis (1), autoimmune hepatitis (1), acute liver failure (1), and respiratory distress (1). Conclusion: Singleagent avelumab shows an acceptable safety profile in a heavily pretreated population of pts with LA/M malignancies. To date, >1,500 pts have been enrolled in the JAVELIN Solid Tumor clinical trial. Additional safety and efficacy analyses from this study are ongoing, and recruitment to several phase III trials is underway.},

abstract = {Background: Platinum‐based CRT followed by durvalumab consolidation (PACIFIC study regimen) is standard of care for pts with unresectable Stage III NSCLC, without progression after platinum‐based CRT. In PACIFIC, only 6% of pts had EGFRm NSCLC. Osimertinib is a 3rd‐generation, CNS‐active, oral, irreversible EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that potently and selectively inhibits both EGFR‐TKI sensitizing and EGFR T790M resistance mutations. FLAURA data (median OS: HR 0.80; 95.05% CI 0.64, 1.00; P=0.046) indicate osimertinib could provide benefit to pts with unresectable Stage III NSCLC. LAURA (NCT03521154) will assess the efficacy and safety of osimertinib as maintenance therapy in pts with locally advanced, unresectable, EGFRm, Stage III NSCLC without disease progression during/following definitive platinum‐based CRT. Previously presented: WCLC, Shun L et al. 2018 J Thorac Oncol;13(10 suppl):S497; we report protocol updates (Feb 2020). Trial design: In this Ph III, double blind, placebo‐controlled trial, pts will be randomized (2:1) to osimertinib 80 mg/day or placebo, until objective radiological disease progression per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1, confirmed by blinded independent central review (BICR). Key inclusion criteria: ≥18 years (≥20 Japan); locally advanced unresectable Stage III NSCLC; central/local confirmation of Ex19del/L858R; WHO PS 0–1; ≥2 cycles of concurrent/sequential platinum‐based CRT; no investigator‐assessed (IA) progression; creatinine <1.5x ULN and creatinine clearance ≥30 mL/min. Primary objective: to assess the efficacy of osimertinib by BICR progression‐free survival (PFS). Secondary objectives: PFS by mutation status, CNS PFS, OS and safety. Pts with BICR‐confirmed disease progression (IA‐confirmed if after PFS analysis) may be un‐blinded to receive open‐label osimertinib; all will have post‐progression follow‐up. Serious adverse events (SAEs) and AEs of special interest will be collected throughout the study and survival follow‐up. First pt enrolled July 2018; results expected late 2022.

abstract = {Introduction: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are widely used in 1st ‐line or 2nd ‐line treatment of advanced NSCLC, but effective treatment after resistance to ICIs is still controversial. We previously reported that anlotinib plus docetaxel as 2nd‐line treatment in advanced NSCLC showed better clinical efficacy than docetaxel alone in two phase II trials (ALTER‐L016, ALTER‐L018). Therefore, to further assess the efficacy and safety of anlotinib plus docetaxel in advanced NSCLC patients (pts) who had been pre‐treated with ICIs by pooling raw data from the two phase II trials. Methods: Efficacy and safety data from 2 multi‐institutional, randomized, controlled comparative, phase II trials of 73 advanced NSCLC pts who had progressed after 1st‐line platinum‐based chemotherapy were pooled for this analysis. The studies shared similar dosing intervals and doses, pts were randomly allocated to receive anlotinib (10/12 mg QD from day 1 to 14 of a 21‐day cycle) plus docetaxel (60/75 mg/m2 Q3W) (group A+D) or docetaxel (60/75 mg/m2 Q3W) only (group D). Safety assessments included adverse events (AEs), physical examination and clinical laboratory tests. [Clinical Trials Registration. NCT03726736 and NCT03624309.]. Results: At data cut‐off (Mar 1, 2022), 73 pts. were available for efficacy and safety analysis (demographics are shown in Table 1). The median PFS was 7.60 months (95%Cl: 4.44‐10.76) vs 2.50 months (95%Cl: 1.34‐3.66) in group A+D and group D, respectively (HR: 0.28; 95%Cl: 0.15‐0.53, p<0.0001). The median OS has not been reached. For tumor response, the ORR was 34.88% vs 12.50% (p=0.048) and the DCR was 93.02% vs 62.50% (p=0.002) in group A+D and group D, respectively. The adverse events that possibly or definitely related to therapy occurred in 38 (88%) of pts. experienced total of 43 grade 1‐2 adverse events in group A+D, and in 21 (70%) of pts. experienced total of 30 grade 1‐2 adverse events in group D. The most common grade ≥3 TRAEs were neutropenia (5, 12%), leukopenia (2, 7%), and oral mucositis (1, 2%) in group A+D, and leukopenia (1, 3%), pneumonia (1, 3%) in group D. Conclusions: Anlotinib plus docetaxel exhibited clinically meaningful efficacy and a manageable safety profile in advanced NSCLC pts who had been pre‐treated with ICIs, which might be an especially effective option in this setting.

abstract = {Background: Most patients with locally advanced, unresectable nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) progress despite standard platinumbased, concurrent chemoradiation therapy (cCRT).We report interim results for clinical activity, patient‐reported outcomes (PROs), and safety from a global, Phase 3 study (NCT02125461) of durvalumab as consolidation therapy in Stage III patients. Methods: In this double‐blind study, patients with WHO PS 0/1 (any PD‐L1 status) who received ≥2 platinum‐based cCRT cycles without progression were randomized (2:1) 142 days post‐cCRT to durvalumab 10 mg/kg IV Q2W or placebo up to 12 months, stratified by age, sex, and smoking history. Co‐primary endpointswere progression‐free survival (PFS; blinded independent central review, RECIST v1.1) and overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints included 12‐and 18‐month PFS rates, objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DoR), time to death or distant metastasis (TTDM), PROs (EORTC QLQ‐C30 and QLQ‐LC13) and safety. Results: Of 713 randomized patients, 709 received treatment (durvalumab, n=473; placebo, n=236). Baseline characteristics were well balanced. At cutoff, median follow‐up was 14.5 months. Median PFS from randomizationwas significantly longer with durvalumab (16.8 months, 95% CI, 13.0‐18.1) versus placebo (5.6 months, 95% CI, 4.6‐7.8; stratified HR 0.52, 95% CI, 0.42‐0.65; P<0.0001). 12‐and 18‐month PFS rates were 55.9% versus 35.3% and 44.2% versus 27.0%, respectively. ORR was higher (28.4% vs 16.0%; P<0.001) and median DoR longer (not reached vs 13.8 months) with durvalumab. Median TTDM was longer with durvalumab (23.2 vs 14.6 months; stratified HR 0.52, 95% CI, 0.390.69; P<0.0001). OS data were immature. Comparing durvalumab with placebo, grade 3/4 AEs occurred in 29.9% and 26.1%; most common was pneumonia (4.4% vs 3.8%). 15.4% and 9.8% discontinued due to AEs. PROs will be presented. Conclusions: Durvalumab demonstrated a statistically significant, robust improvement in PFS, supported by secondary endpoints. No new safety signals were identified.},

abstract = {Purpose/Objective(s): Curative intent conventional chemoradiotherapy for patients with locally advanced NSCLC is typically associated with high progression rates. In the PET‐Boost trial, individualized dose escalation utilizing hypofractionation and functional imaging was tested as a strategy to improve local control. Here we report on sites of first recurrence. Materials/Methods: We conducted a multi‐institutional phase II study (NCT01024829). Patients with stage II‐III NSCLC were randomized to receive either a boosted dose to the primary tumor (PT) as a whole (arm A) or to a region inside the PT with high FDG‐uptake (> 50%SUVmax) (arm B). Boosted dose was delivered in 24 fractions of 3.0 Gy up to 5.4 Gy, limited by predefined OAR limits. Individualized isotoxic treatment plans were produced by equalizing the mean lung dose. Concurrent/sequential/no chemotherapy was allowed. This trial was conducted before immunotherapy became standard adjuvant treatment. Follow‐up (PET/)CT‐scans were scheduled at 3, 6, 12 and 18‐months. The trial had a phase II, “pick the winner”, non‐comparative design with freedom from local failure rate at 1‐year as primary endpoint. Overall survival was estimated using the Kaplan‐Meier method. Local and regional failures (LF, RF) were assessed by central review of chest‐CT scans. Distant metastases (DM) were reported by local investigators. LF, RF and DM are reported as site of first recurrence. Cumulative incidence rates of first recurrence site were, in competing risk with death, estimated by Aalen‐Johansen method. Results: Between April 2010 and Sept 2017, 54 patients were randomized to arm A and 53 to arm B. Majority of patients had a good performance status (WHO 0‐1, 93%), stage III disease (82%) and were treated with concurrent‐chemotherapy (72%). In arms A and B respectively, median PT GTV was 99 cc (IQR 67‐175) and 115 cc (IQR 64‐179). Median fraction dose was 3.25 Gy to PTVwhole PT and 3.5 Gy to PTV50%SUVmax, resulting in median total planned physical dose 78 Gy and 84 Gy respectively. Central review identified 9 patients with missing scans, and 8 not‐evaluable scans at 1 year (n = 4 due to surgery, n = 4 due to atelectasis, inflammation or fibrosis). Median FU for LF and RF was 12.6 months. At time of analysis, 36 and 39 patients had experienced a recurrence or died. In arms A and B respectively, the 1‐year cumulative incidence rates (reported with 95% CI) for LF as site of first recurrence were 1.9% (0‐6%) and 1.9% (0‐6%), for RF 1.9% (0‐6%) and 5.7% (0‐12%), for DM 37.4% (24‐50%) and 35.8% (23‐49%), and for simultaneous multiple sites 3.7% (0‐8%) and 1.9% (0‐6%). Median FU for OS was 70.4 months. In arms A and B respectively, estimated 1‐year survival was 77% and 62%. Conclusion: While high local control rates were achieved in this phase II trial of hypofractionated dose escalation in patients with stage II‐III NSCLC, distant metastases were frequently seen in this patient cohort with large primary tumors.},

abstract = {Background: The anti‐PD‐L1 mAb atezo blocks the interaction between PD‐L1 and its receptors PD‐1 and B7.1 and restores anti‐tumor immunity. In the OAK trial, pts with 2L/3L advanced NSCLC had improved mOS in the atezo arm (13.8 mo) vs the docetaxel (doc) arm (9.6 mo), with a survival benefit observed regardless of PD‐L1 expression levels on tumor cells (TC) or tumor‐infiltrating immune cells (IC). However, more effective treatment options are needed for pts with early‐stage NSCLC. A global Phase III, randomized, open‐label trial, IMpower010 (NCT02486718), is being conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of atezo vs BSC following adjuvant cisplatin (cis)‐based chemotherapy (chemo) in pts with resected stage IB (tumors ≥ 4 cm)‐IIIA NSCLC. Methods: Pts eligible for study must have complete tumor resection 4 to 12 weeks prior to enrollment for pathologic stage IB (tumors ≥ 4 cm)‐IIIA NSCLC, be adequately recovered from surgery, be able to receive cis‐based adjuvant chemo and have an ECOG PS 0‐1. Pts with other malignancies, autoimmune disease, hormonal cancer or radiation therapy within 5 years and prior chemo or immunotherapy are excluded from study. Approximately 1127 pts will be enrolled regardless of PD‐L1 status. Pts will receive up to four 21‐d cycles of cis‐based chemo (cis [75 mg/m2 IV, d 1] + vinorelbine [30 mg/m2 IV, d 1, 8], doc [75 mg/m2 IV, d 1] or gemcitabine [1250 mg/m2 IV, d 1, 8], or pemetrexed [500 mg/m2 IV, d 1; only non‐squamous NSCLC]). No adjuvant radiation therapy is permitted. After adjuvant chemo, eligible pts will be randomized 1:1 to receive 16 cycles of atezo 1200 mg q3w or BSC. Stratification factors include sex, histology (squamous vs non‐squamous), disease stage (IB vs II vs IIA) and PD‐L1 status by IHC (TC2/3 [≥ 5% expressing PD‐L1] and any IC vs TC0/1 [ < 5%] and IC2/3 vs TC0/1 and IC0/1 [ < 5%]). The primary endpoint is disease‐free survival; secondary endpoints include OS and safety. Exploratory biomarkers, including PD‐L1 expression, immune‐ and tumor‐related biomarkers before, during and after treatment with atezo and at radiographic disease recurrence, or confirmation of new primary NSCLC, will be evaluated.},

abstract = {Several trials have evaluated the appropriate initial duration of platinum based chemotherapy: 3 versus 6 cycles, 4 versus continuous cycles, or 2 versus 4 cycles after non‐progression to the initial 2 treatments. In all situations there was no benefit to longer duration of chemotherapy and both ASCO and NCCN recommend no more than 6 cycles of initial treatment. Continuation of lower intensity therapy (typically with a single agent from the initial doublet) was also tested. Studies of weekly paclitaxel after carboplatin‐paclitaxel (Belani et al) or gemcitabine after cisplatin‐gemcitabine (Brodowicz et al) showed no OS difference, but a possible benefit in PFS. Studies evaluated the introduction of a non‐cross resistant agent (early second line) in patients without progression after initial chemotherapy. Westeel et al. randomized patients after MIC x 3 to either observation versus vinorelbine; Fidias et al. evaluated immediate versus delayed docetaxel after carboplatingemcitabine x 4 and JMEN study looked into pemetrexed versus placebo after four cycles of platinum doublet. For the latter two studies, about 50% of patients completed 6 maintenance cycles and 50‐60% of patients in the observation arm received second line therapy; this is consistent with rates of second line therapy in multiple studies of NSCLC. Results showed a 2‐3 month difference in PFS favoring immediate therapy. In terms of overall survival, there was no difference with vinorelbine, and a 2.6‐2.8 month difference with either docetaxel or pemetrexed (significant only with pemetrexed). QoL was not affected by continuous chemotherapy and tumor related symptoms improved with pemetrexed. Erlotinib has been evaluated in 3 randomized trials against placebo (SATURN), observation (IFCT‐GFPC 0502) or in combination with bevacizumab against placebo‐bevacizumab (ATLAS). In all studies there was a PFS benefit (HR 0.71‐0.82), but OS was only significant in the SATURN trial (HR 0.81). PFS benefit was limited to non‐squamous histology for pemetrexed, as opposed to the docetaxel and erlotinib trials. Despite the initial negative trials, continuation pemetrexed following platinum‐pemetrexed doublet has emerged as a standard option for non‐squamous NSCLC. PARAMOUNT randomized between pemetrexed and placebo following four cycles of cisplatin pemetrexed. It showed a PFS benefit (HR 0.64) and also an OS benefit (2.9 month difference, HR 0.78) in favor of continuation maintenance. AVAPERL used a similar design, however with the addition of bevacizumab throughout therapy, i.e. initial cisplatin‐pemetrexedbevacizumab followed by pemetrexed‐bevacizumab versus bevacizumab. PFS significantly favored pemetrexed (10.2 versus 6.6 months), and although OS was also superior (19.8 versus 15.9 months) it was not statistically significant. The IFCT‐GFPC 0502 trial also evaluated continuation gemcitabine and demonstrated a PFS advantage, but no OS benefit in an underpowered study. Bevacizumab continuation is an accepted approach based on the design of E4599, although its contribution has never been established in a randomized trial. However, a direct comparison between E4599 (carboplatin‐paclitaxel‐bevacizumab followed by bevacizumab) and carboplatin‐pemetrexed‐bevacizumab followed by pemetrexed‐bevacizumab was undertaken in the POINTBREAK study. It showed no OS differences (numerically favored E4599: 13.4 versus 12.6 months), although in pre‐specified analysis of patients going through maintenance (as opposed to ITT) there was a 2‐month difference favoring the combination of pemetrexed‐bevacizumab. E5508 [Clinical‐ Trials.gov identifier:NCT01107626] is attempting to answer this question by directly randomizing patients to either bevacizumab, pemetrexed or the combination after carboplatin‐paclitaxel‐bevacizumab. Subset data from the SATURN trial strongly supports switch maintenance with erlotinib for EGFR mutant patients, who had an impressive three fold higher median PFS (44 vs 14 weeks; HR: 0.10; 95% CI: 0.04‐0.25). INFORM included 296 Asian patients, who were randomized between gefitinib and placebo. PFS favored gefitinib maintenance (4.8 vs 2.6 months, HR=0.42; 95% CI: 0.33‐0.55; p <0.0001). No overall survival benefit has been found for squamous cell patients. However, a PFS benefit was seen in IFCT‐GFPC 0502 for continuation maintenance with gemcitabine and in SATURN for sequential erlotinib. The ABOUND study with carboplatin/ nab‐paclitaxel is exploring the nab‐paclitaxel maintenance in squamous‐cell and results are awaited. The SQUIRE trial evaluated the anti‐EGFR monoclonal antibody necitumumab in combination with cisplatingemcitabine followed by maintenance necitumumab. It modestly improved overall survival and PFS over chemotherapy alone (median OS 11.5 vs 9.9 months, HR 0.84, p=0.012; PFS HR 0.85, p=0.02). The contribution of bevacizumab maintenance phase was not prospectively been established. However, a retrospective landmark analysis of E4599 evaluated the patients who were alive without progression for at least 3 weeks after completion of 6 cycles of chemotherapy. The PFS favored bevacizumab maintenance (4.4 vs 2.8 months; HR 0.64). OS was also longer (median 12.8 vs 11.4 months). ECOG 5508 is an important ongoing study, as mentioned previously. Another ongoing study (MO 22097) is evaluating the role of continuing bevacizumab in combination with a second line chemotherapy, beyond progression to maintenance bevacizumab. In a phase III placebo‐controlled study, carboplatin and paclitaxel were given with or without concurrent and maintenance sorafenib, but no improvement in overall survival was shown and the results were detrimental in patients with squamous cell histology. CALGB 30607 of maintenance sunitinib versus placebo met its primary endpoint of improving PFS (4.3 versus 2.8 mos), including squamous histology. There was no effect on OS. EORTC 08092 evaluated pazopanib given as maintenance treatment following standard first line platinum‐based chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC. This study was stopped due to lack of efficacy by stringent criteria for PFS at a futility interim analysis. A phase III trial of carboplatin, paclitaxel with or without concomitant and maintenance ipilimumab (an anti‐CTLA4 agent) is ongoing, and was initiated taking into account the positive results obtained adding maintenance ipilimumab to the platinum doublet in a previous phase II study. Vaccine therapy has also been studied as maintenance treatment in NSCLC. Belagenpumatucel‐ L (Lucanix) is an allogeneic cancer vaccine, obtained from TGF‐beta2 antisense gene modified whole NSCLC cell lines. There was no difference in overall survival between arms (median survival 20.3 versus 17.8 months with belagenpumatucel‐L versus placebo, respectively. Tecemotide (L‐BLP‐25) is a vaccine against MUC1 antigen. START trial randomized patients with stage III NSCLC who completed chemoradiotherapy between tecemotide injections or placebo. No significant difference in overall survival with the administration of tecemotide after chemoradiotherapy was found ‐ median OS was 25.6 months with tecemotide versus 22,3 months with placebo.},

abstract = {Background: In PACIFIC, durvalumab significantly extended PFS compared with placebo (HR 0.52; P<0.0001) for pts with locally advanced, unresectable NSCLC who had previously received concurrent chemoradiotherapy (cCRT). The safety profile of durvalumab in this study was similar to placebo. Here we report a safety analysis of a descriptive comparison of PACIFIC with a pooled dataset of durvalumab monotherapy studies. Methods: Data were pooled for pts treated with durvalumab monotherapy (10 mg/kg IV Q2W) from three trials (N=1,889), the Phase III PACIFIC (n=475), Phase II ATLANTIC (n=444 advanced NSCLC pts), and Phase I/II 1108 (n=970 solid tumor pts, including 304 NSCLC pts) studies. The incidences of all‐causality AEs (as of Feb 13, 2017, data cutoff for the PACIFIC analysis) were graded using CTCAE v4.03 and summarized descriptively for comparison between PACIFIC and the pooled dataset. Results: Compared with the pooled dataset (Table), PACIFIC had lower incidences of grade 3/4 AEs and SAEs, but a higher rate of AEs leading to discontinuation (15.4% [durvalumab] vs. 9.8% [placebo] compared with 9.4% [pooled dataset]). In a separate comparison excluding PACIFIC from the pooled dataset (N=1,414), any‐grade (grade 3/4) pneumonitis/radiation pneumonitis occurred in 33.9% (3.4%) of pts on durvalumab and 24.8% (3.0%) on placebo in PACIFIC (with similar grade 3/4 incidences for both) and 2.3% (0.5%) of pts in the reduced pooled dataset. Conclusions: Durvalumab monotherapy has a well‐defined and acceptable safety profile. Differences observed in the rates of AEs with durvalumab on the PACIFIC regimen may be attributable to the pt population or prior cCRT. (Table Presented) .},

abstract = {Background: An effective biomarker to direct precise consolidation treatment after CRT is still lacking. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) molecular residual disease (MRD) following curativeintent treatment strongly predicts recurrence in multiple tumor types, but whether further treatment can improve outcomes in patients with MRD remains unclear. Hereby, we applied CAPP‐Seq ctDNA analysis to plasma samples collected before and after definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT) or radiotherapy (RT) in unresectable LA‐NSCLC. Methods: A total of 62 unresectable LA‐NSCLC patients were prospectively enrolled, providing 62 baseline and 49 post‐definitive CRT/RT plasma samples. All patients underwent a PET/CT scan at baseline and 33 patients received a mid‐treatment PET/CT scan upon reaching a RT dose of 40Gy/20f during therapy. These 33 patients were randomly assigned to either receive or not receive adaptive dose‐escalated RT. A group of patients who received immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) consolidation after CRT/RT was compared with patients who were ctDNA‐/high 4TMTV post‐treatment. Results: ctDNA was detected at baseline in 44 (71.0%) patients. Pretreatment ctDNA concentration was significantly correlated with TMTV (p = 0.004) and TLG (p = 0.010). Baseline ctDNA detection and concentration were not able to differentiate patients with varying treatment responses or predict survival. However, patients with undetectable ctDNA and lowTMTVexhibited significantly better PFS (p = 0.024). One month after completing CRT or RT, ctDNA was detected in 25 (47.2%) patients. While the concentration of circulating free DNA (cfDNA) remained relatively stable (p = 0.652), both the mean ctDNA Variant Allele Frequency (VAF) (p = 0.002) and ctDNA concentration (p = 0.043) showed a significant decrease. Patients with undetectable ctDNA post‐treatment exhibited significantly longer PFS and OS. A lower ΔTMTV was significantly associated with longer PFS and OS. Compared to the nonresponse group, the response group exhibited significantly lower change in 4SUVmax (p = 0.024), with a trend towards lower change in TMTV, although not significant (p = 0.064). Compared with the matched 30 patient receiving ICI consolidation, those with negative ctDNA and high 4TMTV after CRT demonstrated significantly better PFS (p = 0.042) and OS (p = 0.039). Conclusions: Baseline ctDNA combined with TMTV can enhance the predictive ability for survival. Post‐CRT ctDNA and 4TMTV possess strong prognostic capabilities. Patients who are ctDNA‐ and with high 4TMTV may be exempt from ICI consolidation therapy.},

abstract = {Introduction: Single‐agent chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, is the standard of care in patients with metastatic NSCLC who progressed on platinum‐based therapy and checkpoint inhibitors. However, docetaxel is associated with poor survival (median overall survival [OS] of <1 year); thus, novel agents are needed to further improve outcomes in this setting. Sacituzumab govitecan (SG) is an antibody‐drug conjugate composed of an anti‐Trop‐2 antibody coupled to the cytotoxic SN‐38 payload via a proprietary, hydrolyzable linker. In a single‐arm expansion of the phase 1/2 IMMU‐132‐01 basket study of advanced epithelial cancers (NCT01631552), SG demonstrated an objective response rate (ORR) of 17% and median OS of 9.5 months, with a manageable safety profile in 54 patients with metastatic NSCLC who had multiple prior therapies (Heist RS, et al. J Clin Oncol. 2017). EVOKE‐01 randomized phase 3 study was designed to further evaluate SG in patients with metastatic NSCLC. Methods: EVOKE‐01 (NCT05089734) is an open‐label, global, multicenter, randomized, phase 3 study comparing the efficacy and safety of SG vs docetaxel in patients with metastatic NSCLC. Key eligibility criteria include age ≥18 years, pathologically documented stage IV NSCLC at time of study entry, and progression after platinum‐based chemotherapy and anti‐PD(L)1 therapy given either in combination or sequentially. Patients with EGFR, ALK, or other known actionable genomic alterations must have also received treatment with ≥1 approved appropriate TKI. Other inclusion criteria are ECOG performance status 0‐1 and adequate hematologic, hepatic, and renal function. Patients with prior treatment with topoisomerase inhibitors are excluded. Patients are randomized 1:1 to receive intravenous SG (10 mg/kg on day 1 and 8) or docetaxel (75 mg/m2 on day 1) in 21‐day cycles until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity. Stratification is based on predominant histology (squamous vs nonsquamous), best response to prior immune therapy (PD/SD vs CR/PR), and prior therapy for actionable genomic alteration (yes vs no). The primary endpoint is OS. Key secondary endpoints include progression‐free survival, ORR, duration of response, and disease control rate, as assessed by investigator RECIST v1.1, mean change from baseline in NSCLC‐SAQ total score and shortness of breath, and safety. This study plans to enroll ∼520 patients globally and is open for recruitment. Keywords: antibody‐drug conjugate, immune checkpoint inhibitors, phase III clinical trial},

abstract = {Background: First‐line (1L) SoC for pts with HER2‐mutation positive (HER2m+) NSCLC is platinum‐based chemotherapy ± immunotherapy. To date, no targeted 1L treatments (txs) have been approved. Zongertinib is a HER2‐selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor that binds to wild‐type and mutated HER2, sparing EGFR. In Phase Ia of Beamion LUNG‐1 (NCT04886804), zongertinib conferred objective response (OR)/disease control rates of 49/91% in pts with pretreated HER2 aberration‐positive solid tumours, and 58/97% in those pts with HER2m+ NSCLC, with manageable safety with few EGFR‐associated adverse events. Here, we describe Beamion LUNG‐2 (NCT06151574), a phase III, randomised, controlled, open‐label trial which will compare the efficacy and safety of 1L zongertinib with SoC in pts with HER2m+, locally advanced/metastatic non‐squamous NSCLC. Trial design: ∼270 pts will be randomised 1:1 to receive either zongertinib or SoC. Key inclusion criteria: histologically/cytologically diagnosed advanced/metastatic non‐squamous NSCLC; no prior systemic tx for locally advanced/metastatic disease; HER2 mutation in the TKD; ≥1 measurable lesion (RECIST 1.1). Key exclusion criteria: tumours that have alterations with available therapy, and radiotherapy/major surgery ≤4 weeks prior to randomisation. In the experimental arm, 120 mg oral zongertinib QD will be given in 21‐day cycles. In the comparator arm, 500 mg/m2 intravenous pemetrexed chemotherapy plus either 75 mg/m2 cisplatin or Area Under the Curve 5 carboplatin, plus 200 mg pembrolizumab will be given on Day 1 q3w for four cycles, followed by 500 mg/m2 pemetrexed plus 200 mg pembrolizumab q3w for ≤35 cycles. In both arms, tx will continue until progressive disease (RECIST 1.1), undue toxicity, or other criteria are met. Primary endpoint: progression‐free survival (RECIST 1.1). Secondary endpoints: OR (defined as best overall response of complete or partial response, RECIST 1.1); pt‐reported outcomes (changes from baseline to Week 25); overall survival; and adverse events during the on‐treatment period (CTCAE 5.0).

abstract = {Cytokine interleukin‐1β (IL‐1β) has multiple pro‐tumorogenic effects on tumor microenvironment, thereby promotingcarcinogenesis, tumor invasiveness, and immunosuppression. CAN is a selective IL‐1β inhibitor that aims to targettumor‐promoting inflammation to reduce immune suppression, thereby potentiating effects of immunotherapy with PD‐1 inhibitors such as PEM. Ph 3 CANTOS study has shown IL‐1β inhibition with CAN was associated with reduced incidence of lung cancer (LC) and LC mortality in pts with atherosclerosis, providing a rationale toinvestigate therapeutic role of CAN in LC. CANOPY‐1 ( NCT03631199 ) is a PBO‐controlled, double‐blind,randomized, ph 3 trial designed to evaluate efficacy and safety of PEM + Ctx ± CAN in tx naive pts with stageIIIB/IIIC (not eligible for definitive chemo‐radiation curative tx) or stage IV squamous and nonsquamous NSCLC.The study was divided into 2 parts: part 1 is open labelled, safety run‐in part where pts received CAN 200 mg s.cQ3W + PEM 200 mg i.v Q3W + platinum‐based Ctx (as induction during first 4 cycles only); Cohort A (A, non‐squamous), carboplatin + pemetrexed; Cohort B (B, non‐squamous), cisplatin + pemetrexed; Cohort C (C,squamous or non‐squamous), carboplatin + paclitaxel. Part 2 is randomized and evaluates efficacy and safety of CAN comb regimen vs PBO comb regimen. Primary objective of safety run‐in part: recommended ph 3 doseregimen (RP3R) of CAN comb. Secondary objectives: ORR, DCR, DOR, safety, PK, and immunogenicity. As of 14May 2019 (follow‐up of ≥42 days from C1D1 unless pt discontinued earlier), 10 pts in A, 11 pts in B, and 9 pts in C were treated, of which 73% were male, median age was 63 yrs. In total, 24/30 (80%) pts enrolled were still receivingtx; primary reason for tx discontinuation was progressive disease (3 pts in A and 1 pt each in B and C) and 1 pt dieddue to study indication. 1 pt reported DLT during first 42 days of study tx (C: grade 3 hepatitis, not related to CAN).RP3R of CAN in comb with standard dose PEM + Ctx was 200 mg SC Q3W based on Bayesian logistic regressionmodel (BLRM). Serious AEs regardless of causality were reported in 8 (27%) pts (2 pts in A and 3 pts each in B and C), none of which were considered to be related to CAN. Most common AEs (≥20%, any grade) across all cohorts(n=30) were nausea (37%), vomiting (30%), constipation and fatigue (each 23%), and neutrophil count decrease(20%). 14 pts (47%) experienced grade 3 AEs and 1 pt experienced grade 4 AE (cardiac tamponade [unrelated]).No fatal serious AEs were reported. AEs leading to discontinuation of one of the study drugs were reported in 3(10%) pts (hepatitis, peripheral neuropathy, and polyneuropathy) but none were CAN related. AEs leading to dosereduction and dose interruption of one of study drugs were reported in 3 (10%) pts and 5 (17%) pts, respectively.Only 1 DLT was reported with CAN + PEM + Ctx. Based on BLRM and all relevant clinical data, the RP3R of CANas 200 mg SC Q3W comb was considered safe and well tolerated. Enrollment for the randomized part is completed.},

abstract = {Background: The stage III NSCLC paradigm now includes immunotherapy (IO), but advanced EGFR‐mutant (EGFR+) pts typically don't respond to IO. In 2011 we began a phase II trial of neoadjuvant afatinib (NeoAfat) and standard of care (SOC) curative intent treatment for EGFR+ stage III NSCLC, NCT01553942. We present an interim analysis given the evolving SOC landscape. Methods: EGFR+ stage III pts amenable to curative‐intent chemoradiation (CRT) ± surgery were treated with NeoAfat 40mg po QD x2mo, then concurrent CRT: cisplatin 75mg/m2 + pemetrexed 500mg/m2 IV q3wk up to 4 cycles and 3D conformal RT or IMRT personalized to tumor size, site, operability. Surgery and adjuvant afatinib (AdjAfat) x2yr were optional. Primary outcome was objective response rate (ORR) to NeoAfat. Results: 13 pts were treated (10F/3M); med age 56 (range 34‐75). EGFR mutations: del19 (n = 9); L858R (n = 4). Stage: operable IIIA (n = 7); inoperable IIIA/B (n = 6). NeoAfat ORR = 69% (95% CI 39‐91); 5 (38%) pts dose reduced NeoAfat. All pts proceeded to CRT with pre‐op med RT dose of 54 Gy (range 45‐66; n = 7), definitive med dose of 65 Gy (range 63‐72; n = 6). 5 (71%) of the 7 surgical pts had major (4) or complete (1) pathologic response. 7 (54%) pts started AdjAfat at med dose of 30mg QD; 4 completed 2yr, 2 aborted early, 1 ongoing . Key grade 3/4 toxicities: rash 5), diarrhea (5), esophagitis (3), nausea (3), pneumonitis (2 gr 3) and febrile neutropenia (1); no treatment‐related deaths. With med follow‐up of 24.1 mo (range 5.0‐64.2), 6 (46%) pts have recurred; including 4/6 inoperable pts, 2/7 who had surgery, 1/5 with major path response (CNS‐only recurrence). Med PFS is 34.6 mo (95% CI 12.6‐ NR). 2‐yr OS is 85% (95% CI 33‐98). Conclusions: Neo‐adjuvant afatinib achieves high ORR and major surgical path responses, and doesn't impair receipt of SOC, curative CRT ± surgery in EGFR+ stage III NSCLC. Feasibility of NeoAfat exceeds AdjAfat in stage III setting. The prolonged PFS compares favorably to PACIFIC IO arm; more data is needed about optimal strategy for stage III EGFR+ pts. ASCENT is still ongoing, but it and similar randomized RTOG 1306 have accrued slowly, highlighting the challenge of studying curative approaches in genotype‐defined subgroups.},

abstract = {Introduction: There is an unmet need in elucidating effective correlative biomarkers for individualized selection of therapeutic regimens in patients with a diagnosis of advanced NSCLC. Recent innovations in artificial intelligence (AI) can enhance the role of CT imaging by taking advantage of previously unutilized information through the ability to identify imaging biomarkers through quantitative analysis that is objective, reproducible, and rapidly obtainable. Our group has previously leveraged this approach by applying AI in patients with NSCLC treated with nivolumab in CheckMate017, CheckMate026, and CheckMate063. In this cohort, we identified a radiomics signature (NivoSig) that was correlated with overall survival (OS). In the current analysis, we sought to validate NivoSig in a separate cohort of patients with distinct systemic therapy regimens who were enrolled in a large randomized trial. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed CT images and associated clinical metadata for patients enrolled on SWOG S0819 [NCT00946712]. Participants (n=1,229) had a diagnosis of advanced NSCLC and were randomized to treatment with chemotherapy (carboplatin/paclitaxel or carboplatin/paclitaxel/bevacizumab) alone (n=607) or the same chemotherapy regimen in combination with cetuximab (n=622). All participants were included as an external validation set for NivoSig. From CT images, the volume of measurable tumor lesions was semi‐automatically segmented and seven radiomic variables depicting tumor phenotype were extracted. The radiomic signature used a predefined and locked combination of these imaging variables to output a continuous value, ranging from 0 to 1 (from most to least favorable estimated OS); patients were categorized as low‐ vs. high‐risk groups as previously determined. Cox regression and the log‐rank test was used to validate the NivoSig risk‐groupings with OS. Survival distributions were estimated via Kaplan‐Meier. Radiomic features between risk groups were compared using a t‐test. Results: The primary publication reported no difference in OS (Hazard ratio (HR)=0.93[95CI: 0.83‐1.04], P=0.22) and data in this analysis were consistent (HR=0.94[95CI: 0.84‐1.06], P=0.315). Patients with high‐risk prognostic NivoSig had a 50% increased risk of death compared to low‐risk NivoSig (HR=1.50 [95CI: 1.33‐1.69], P<0.0001), and shorter median survival (n=697, 12.3 months [95CI: 11.1‐13.3]) vs. high‐risk NivoSig (n=532, 8.4 months [95CI: 7.48‐8.98]).In addition, comparison of NivoSig’s individual radiomic features stratified high‐risk (n=532) vs. low‐risk (n=697) patients as follows (mean(SD), P‐value): A) distinct tumor texture in two radiomics components, laws boundary and spatial correlation (P<0.001 for both); B) higher overall tumor volume (157.3(202.2) vs. 53(51.5) cm3, P<0.001); C) higher liver tumor volume (20.4(88.3) vs. 0(0.4) cm3, P<0.001); D) higher mediastinal lymph node tumor volume (25.2(40.2) vs. 10.9(15) cm3, P<0.001); E) higher axillary lymph node tumor volume (2.2(32.6) vs. 0(0) cm3, P=0.078); and F) higher number of target lesions (6.18(3.71) vs. 3.97(2.29) cm3, P<0.001). Conclusions: NivoSig is a novel AI‐guided radiomics signature previously derived in patients treated with immunotherapy. In this analysis we found that it was generalizable to patients in a large, randomized trial receiving a distinct treatment approach without immunotherapy. In addition, individual AI‐generated radiomic features stratified high‐ vs. low‐risk patients with respect to OS. Future directions will incorporate these features to better elucidate mechanisms of resistance. Keywords: NSCLC, Artificial Intelligence, Radiomics},

abstract = {Introduction: Most patients with advanced NSCLC do not harbor genomic alterations associated with approved first‐line targeted therapies. The standard of care for these patients is a programmed death (ligand)‐1 (PD‐[L]1) inhibitor alone, if the tumor highly expresses PD‐L1, or in combination with platinum doublet chemotherapy, independent of PD‐L1 expression. However, most patients do not respond to these therapies or achieve only a transient response, highlighting an unmet need. Sacituzumab govitecan (SG) is an antibody‐drug conjugate composed of an anti‐Trop‐2 antibody coupled to the cytotoxic SN‐38 payload via a proprietary, hydrolyzable linker. In the phase 1/2 IMMU‐132‐01 basket study (NCT01631552), SG demonstrated an objective response rate (ORR) of 17% and median overall survival (OS) of 9.5 months, with a manageable safety profile in 54 patients with metastatic NSCLC after multiple prior therapies (Heist RS, et al. J Clin Oncol. 2017). We hypothesize that combining SG with pembrolizumab or with pembrolizumab + platinum chemotherapy will improve outcomes for patients with advanced NSCLC. Methods: EVOKE‐02 (NCT05186974) is an open‐label, multicenter, multicohort, global phase 2 study evaluating SG plus pembrolizumab with or without carboplatin (carbo) or cisplatin (cis) in advanced NSCLC. Key eligibility criteria include age ≥18 years, stage IV NSCLC at enrollment, measurable disease by RECIST v1.1, ECOG performance status of 0 or 1, and adequate organ function. Patients must not have actionable genomic alterations and must not have received prior systemic therapy for metastatic NSCLC. Up to 164 patients will be enrolled. SG plus pembrolizumab will be assessed in squamous/nonsquamous NSCLC with Tumor Proportion Score (TPS) ≥50% (cohort A, ∼30 patients) and TPS <50% (cohort B, ∼30 patients) and SG plus pembrolizumab with carbo/cis in nonsquamous (cohort C, ∼40 patients) and squamous (cohort D, ∼40 patients) NSCLC regardless of PD‐L1 expression. Patients are randomly assigned if cohorts enrolling concurrently have overlapping eligibility. SG will be administered intravenously (IV) at 10 mg/kg on day 1 and 8 until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, pembrolizumab 200 mg IV on day 1 for up to 35 cycles, carbo AUC 5 or cis 75 mg/m2 on day 1 for up to 4 cycles in 21‐d cycles. A safety run‐in will be conducted for cohorts C and D (up to 24 patients each) to determine the optimal SG dose by dose de‐escalation. Choice of platinum will be based on preliminary efficacy in safety run‐in. The primary endpoints are ORR assessed by independent review per RECIST v1.1 and the incidence of dose‐limiting toxicities per dose for the first 21 days of the safety run‐in to determine the recommended phase 2 dose of SG in combination with pembrolizumab and a platinum. Key secondary endpoints include progression‐free survival by independent review, OS, duration of response, disease control rate, and safety. This study is open for recruitment and is enrolling globally. Keywords: antibody‐drug conjugate, immune checkpoint inhibitors, phase II clinical trial},

abstract = {Background: Standard of care for patients (pts) with unresectable (UR) stage III NSCLC is the 'PACIFIC regimen', based on data from the phase 3 placebo (pbo)‐controlled trial where consolidation durva following CRT improved overall survival (OS; hazard ratio [HR], 0.68 [95% CI, 0.53, 0.87]) and progression‐ free survival (PFS; HR, 0.52 [95% CI 0.42, 0.65]), in an all‐comer population. However, the benefit of immunotherapy (IO) in pts with EGFRm stage III NSCLC is unclear. We report a post hoc exploratory efficacy and safety analysis from 35 pts with EGFRm NSCLC from the PACIFIC trial (NCT02125461). Methods: Pts with stage III UR‐NSCLC, WHO performance status (PS) 0/1 and no progression after ≥2 cycles platinum‐based concurrent CRT were randomized 2:1 (1‐42 days post CRT) to receive durva (10mg/kg IV q2w for up to 1 year) or pbo, stratified by age, sex, and smoking history; enrollment was not restricted by oncogenic driver gene mutation status or PD‐L1 expression. Primary endpoints: PFS (BICR; RECIST v1.1) and OS; key secondary endpoints: objective response rate (ORR) and safety. Treatment effects for the EGFRm subgroup were estimated using an unstratified Cox proportional hazard model; medians were estimated using the Kaplan‐Meier method. Statistical analyses were exploratory. Data cut‐off (DCO) for the EGFRm subgroup efficacy analysis was 11 January 2021. Results: Of 713 pts randomized, 35 had EGFRm NSCLC based on local testing (durva n = 24, pbo n = 11). In the EGFRm subgroup, more pts in the pbo vs durva arm were male (73% vs 54%), had stage IIIA disease (64% vs 46%), PS 0 (64% vs 54%) and received pre‐CRT induction chemotherapy (36% vs 8%). More pts in the durva arm were Asian (63% vs 55%) and had PD‐L1 on < 25% tumor cells (67% vs 36%); median age was consistent across arms. At DCO, median duration of follow‐up for survival was 42.7 months (range, 3.7‐74.3 months) for all randomized pts in the subgroup. Median PFS was 11.2 months (95% CI 7.3, 20.7) with durva vs 10.9 months (95% CI 1.9, not evaluable [NE]) with pbo; HR 0.91 (95% CI 0.39, 2.13). Median OS was 46.8 months (95% CI 29.9, NE) with durva vs 43.0 months (95% CI 14.9, NE) with pbo; HR 1.02 (95% CI 0.39, 2.63). ORR was 26.1% (95% CI, 10.2, 48.4) and 18.2% (95% CI 2.3, 51.8) with durva and pbo, respectively. The safety profile for durva was consistent with the overall population. In the durva and pbo subgroup arms, radiation pneumonitis was reported in 42% vs 36% of pts, and pneumonitis was reported in 17% vs 18% of pts (1 grade 3, pbo arm), respectively. Conclusions: In this post hoc exploratory analysis of 35 pts, PFS and OS outcomes with durva were similar to pbo in the EGFRm population, with wide CIs. The benefit of IO in this population remains unclear. The ongoing LAURA study (NCT03521154) is investigating the efficacy and safety of maintenance osimertinib in pts with locally advanced EGFRm stage III URNSCLC with no progression after CRT.},

Here we report interim results from a global, Phase 3 study of the anti‐PD‐L1 durvalumab (D) as consolidation therapy in Stage III pts without progression following pt‐based cCRT. Methods: Pts with a WHO PS 0/1 who received ≥2 cycles of Pt‐based cCRT without progression were randomized (2:1) 1‐42 days postcCRT to receive D 10 mg/kg IV Q2 W or placebo for up to 12 months (mo.). Co‐primary endpoints were PFS and OS. Secondary endpoints were 12‐ and 18‐month PFS rates, ORR, DoR, time to death or distant metastasis (TTDM) and safety. Physical performance and global health status were also assessed. Results: Between 05/2014 and 04/2016, 709 (26 from Deutschland) received consolidation treatment (D, n = 473; placebo, n = 236). Median follow‐up was 14.5 mo. Median PFS was significantly longer with D (16.8 mo., 95% CI, 13.0‐18.1) vs placebo (5.6 mo., 95% CI, 4.6‐7.8; stratified HR 0.52, 95% CI, 0.42‐0.65; P < 0.0001). 12‐ and 18‐month PFS rates were 55.9% versus 35.3% and 44.2% vs 27.0%. ORR was higher (28.4% vs 16.0%; P < 0.001) and median DoR was longer (n. r. vs 13.8 mo.) with D consolidation therapy. Median TTDM was longer with D (23.2 vs 14.6 mo.; stratified HR 0.52, 95% CI, 0.39‐ 0.69; P < 0.0001). OS data were immature at the time of interim PFS analysis. Comparing D with placebo, grade 3/4 AEs occurred in 29.9% and 26.1%; most common was pneumonia (4.4% vs 3.8%). 15.4% and 9.8% discontinued due to AEs. Conclusions: D demonstrated significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS and was well tolerated.},

abstract = {Background: Pembro, an anti‒PD‐1 antibody is standard of care therapy for metastatic NSCLC as monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy. Durva, an anti–PD‐L1 antibody, is approved for unresectable, stage III NSCLC without disease progression (PD) following CCRT. Early trials of pembro in combination with CRT, either concurrent or as consolidation, showed acceptable tolerability and promising PFS in patients (pts) with unresectable stage III NSCLC. Early data suggest the combination of poly(ADP‐ribose) polymerase (PARP) + anti–PD‐(L)1 inhibition can enhance treatment effects. KEYLYNK‐012 (NCT04380636) evaluates pembro + CCRT followed by pembro with/without the PARP inhibitor ola vs CCRT followed by durva in pts with unresectable, locally advanced, stage III NSCLC. Trial design: This global phase 3, randomized, placebo‐ and active‐controlled, double‐blind study will enroll pts aged ≥18 y with previously untreated, pathologically confirmed, stage IIIA–C NSCLC, ECOG PS 0/1, and tumor sample available for PD‐L1 evaluation. Pts will be randomized 1:1:1 to CCRT (platinum‐doublet chemotherapy [cisplatin + pemetrexed or etoposide; or carboplatin + paclitaxel] + radiotherapy 60 Gy over 6 wk [cycles 2–3]) with pembro 200 mg Q3W (groups A and B) or CCRT alone (group C) for 3 cycles. This will be followed by pembro 200 mg Q3W for 17 cycles + placebo (group A) or ola 300 mg BID (group B); or durva 10 mg/kg Q2W for 26 cycles (group C). Randomization is stratified by disease stage (IIIA vs IIIB/IIIC), tumor histology (squamous vs nonsquamous), PD‐L1 tumor proportion score (≥50% vs <50%) and region (East Asia vs North America/Western Europe/UK vs other). PFS (RECIST v1.1 by blinded independent central review [BICR]) and OS are dual primary endpoints. Secondary endpoints include ORR, DOR, safety and tolerability, and QOL outcomes. After CCRT, tumor response will be evaluated per RECIST v1.1 by BICR and at regular intervals throughout the study until PD, new cancer therapy, study withdrawal, or death. AEs will be graded by NCI CTCAE v5.0. Enrollment will begin Jun 8, 2020 at 220 sites. Clinical trial identification: NCT04380636; EudraCT, 2019‐003237‐41.

abstract = {Background: Selpercatinib is a highly selective and potent CNS active RET inhibitor approved for treatment of advanced RET fusion‐positive (RET+) NSCLC. Treatment or prevention of CNS disease is critical in RET+ NSCLC patients (pts), who have nearly a 50% lifetime prevalence of brain metastases (mets) (Drilon et al. JTO 2018). LIBRETTO‐431 is the first study to compare intracranial (IC) efficacy of a targeted therapy to chemo/IO in pts with oncogene driven NSCLC. Methods: LIBRETTO‐431 (NCT04194944) is a randomized, open‐label, phase 3 trial comparing 1L selpercatinib vs chemotherapy (cisplatin/carboplatin + pemetrexed) +/‐ pembrolizumab. As previously reported, the study met its primary endpoint of PFS by blinded independent central review (BICR) at the pre‐planned interim analysis. IC analyses included CNS and non‐CNS PD, IC PFS and IC responses by BICR per RECIST 1.1 in all pts who had a baseline and one or more post‐baseline CNS scans (CNS‐evaluable) and were designated to receive pembrolizumab if randomized to the control arm (CNS‐pembro population). Adverse events were evaluated in the CNS safety population. Results: A total of 192 of 261 pts enrolled were CNS‐evaluable (selpercatinib: 120, control: 72). Baseline characteristics were generally balanced with the selpercatinib arm having a slightly lower proportion of pts with BICR‐assessed baseline brain mets (21% vs 25%) and prior CNS radiotherapy (RT; 6% vs 10%) compared to the control arm. Selpercatinib delayed CNS PD as evidenced by a lower 12 mo cumulative incidence rate (CIR) for CNS PD, as well as delaying non‐CNS PD compared to control in pts with and without brain mets (Table). In pts with measurable brain mets at baseline (n=29), median time to IC response per RECIST 1.1 was similar between selpercatinib and control (1.4 mo [range: 1.2‐2.9] vs 1.6 mo [range: 1.2‐ 2.9]); however, as previously reported the IC response rates were higher (82% vs 58%) and more durable (12 mo DOR rate 76% vs 63%) with selpercatinib vs control (Zhou et al. NEJM 2023). IC responses to selpercatinib were more common in pts without prior CNS RT (14/15, 93%) than with prior CNS RT (3/6, 50%). Conclusions: Selpercatinib delayed IC progression in advanced RET+ NSCLC pts with or without baseline brain mets and achieved higher IC response rates compared to chemotherapy + pembrolizumab. LIBRETTO‐431 is the first study to demonstrate IC efficacy improvement of a targeted therapy vs chemo/IO in a biomarker selected NSCLC population. These data further support selpercatinib as the preferred 1L regimen in pts with advanced RET+ NSCLC.},

In pts with measurable brain mets at baseline (n=29), median time to IC response per RECIST 1.1 was similar between selpercatinib and control (1.4 mo [range: 1.2‐2.9] vs 1.6 mo [range: 1.2‐ 2.9]); however, as previously reported the IC response rates were higher (82% vs 58%) and more durable (12 mo DOR rate 76% vs 63%) with selpercatinib vs control (Zhou et al. NEJM 2023). IC responses to selpercatinib were more common in pts without prior CNS RT (14/15, 93%) than with prior CNS RT (3/6, 50%). Conclusions: Selpercatinib delayed IC progression in advanced RET+ NSCLC pts with or without baseline brain mets and achieved higher IC response rates compared to chemotherapy + pembrolizumab. LIBRETTO‐431 is the first study to demonstrate IC efficacy improvement of a targeted therapy vs chemo/IO in a biomarker selected NSCLC population. These data further support selpercatinib as the preferred 1L regimen in pts with advanced RET+ NSCLC. (Table Presented).},

abstract = {Purpose: Most patients (pts) with locally advanced NSCLC progress despite concurrent CRT.Here we report interim results from a global, Phase 3 study of the anti‐PD‐L1 durvalumab (D) as consolidation therapy in Stage III pts without progression following pt‐based cCRT. Methods: Pts with a WHO PS 0/1 who received ��2 cycles of Pt‐based cCRT without progression were randomized (2:1) 1‐42 days post‐cCRT to receive D 10 mg/kg IV Q2W or placebo for up to 12 months (mo.). Co‐primary endpoints were PFS and OS. Secondary endpoints were 12‐ and 18‐month PFS rates, ORR, DoR, time to death or distant metastasis (TTDM) and safety. Physical performance and global health status were also assessed. Results: Between 05/2014 and 04/2016, 709 (26 from Germany) received consolidation treatment (D, n = 473; placebo, n = 236). Median follow‐ up was 14.5 mo. Median PFS was significantly longer with D (16.8 mo., 95% CI, 13.0‐18.1) vs placebo (5.6 mo., 95% CI, 4.6‐7.8; stratified HR 0.52, 95% CI, 0.42‐0.65; P < 0.0001). 12‐ and 18‐month PFS rates were 55.9% versus 35.3% and 44.2% vs 27.0%. ORR was higher (28.4% vs 16.0%; P < 0.001) and median DoR was longer (n.r. vs 13.8 mo.) with D consolidation therapy. Median TTDM was longer with D (23.2 vs 14.6 mo.; stratified HR 0.52, 95% CI, 0.39‐0.69; P < 0.0001). OS data were immature at the time of interim PFS analysis. Comparing D with placebo, grade 3/4 AEs occurred in 29.9% and 26.1%; most common was pneumonia (4.4% vs 3.8%). 15.4% and 9.8% discontinued due to AEs. Conclusions: D demonstrated significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS and was well tolerated.},

abstract = {Background: In the Ph 3 PACIFIC study of durvalumab (durva) versus placebo (pbo) in pts with stage III, locally advanced (LA), unresectable NSCLC after concurrent chemoradiotherapy (cCRT), PFS was significantly longer with durva (stratified HR 0.52; 95% CI 0.42‐0.65; P<0.0001). This exploratory analysis characterizes outcomes based on time from completing RT to Tx. Methods: PACIFIC (NCT02125461) was a randomized, double‐blind, all‐comers study of LA NSCLC pts withWHOPS 0/1 who did not progress after ≥2 cycles of platinumbased cCRT. Pts were stratified by age, sex and smoking history and randomized (2:1) to durva 10 mg/kg IV Q2W or pbo up to 12 months. Co‐primary endpoints were PFS (BICR, RECIST v1.1) and OS (not available). Secondary endpoints included ORR, time to death/distant metastases (TTDM) and safety. We investigated potential associations between time to randomized Tx (<14 or≥14 days) with efficacy and safety. Results: As of Feb 13, 2017, 713 pts were randomized, 26% within 14 days of RT. Baseline characteristics between the durva and pbo arm were well balanced in both the <14 and≥14 days groups. PFS benefit with durva compared to pbo was observed regardless of timing from RT to randomization (<14 days: median NR vs 4.8 months, HR=0.39, 95% CI: 0.26‐0.58;≥14 days: median 14.0 vs 5.6 months, HR=0.63, 95% CI: 0.49‐0.80). In addition, TTDM (<14 days: HR=0.33, 95% CI: 0.20‐0.55;≥14 days: HR=0.70, 95% CI: 0.51‐0.95) and ORR (<14 days: 34.2% vs 16.4%; ≥14 days: 26.5% vs 15.8%) favored durva, regardless of time to randomization. There were no reported differences in safety with durva based on time to randomization, with incidences of any‐cause grade 3/4 AEs (34.2% vs 31.3%) and SAEs (30.0% vs 28.2%) comparable across subgroups. In contrast, earlier randomization in the pbo arm was associated with increased rates of grade 3/4 AEs (33.3% vs 25.9%) and SAEs (33.3% vs 19.0%). Early randomization had minimal impact on grade ≥3 pneumonitis/radiation pneumonitis with durva (4.2% vs 4.5%). Conclusions: Durva provided clinical benefit compared to pbo, regardless of time from RT to randomization. There was no meaningful difference in safety, including high grade AEs, in durva‐treated patients randomized within 2 weeks from RT versus later.},

abstract = {Background: Osimertinib is an irreversible EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) selective for both EGFR activating and T790M resistance mutations. In randomized controlled trials (RCTs), osimertinib showed encouraging efficacy in patients with advanced EGFR T790M mutation‐positive NSCLC; however, further investigation is needed in the real‐world where the patient population is more diverse. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of osimertinib in a real‐world setting. Methods: This observational study enrolled 47 patients with metastatic EGFR T790M‐positive NSCLC who progressed on prior EGFR TKI therapy and commenced osimertinib treatment between May and Oct 2016 in Macau. All patients received osimertinib 80 mg once daily until physician‐assessed disease progression. Primary endpoint was response rate (RR). Secondary endpoints included progression free survival (PFS), adverse events (AEs), T790M testing characteristics, and treatment patterns. Results: All patients had stage IV adenocarcinoma and 23.4% had brain metastases; median age was 59.0 years (range 37‐83 years) and 68.1% were female. Prior treatments included EGFR TKI targeted therapy (100%), chemotherapy (46.8%), radiation (19.1%), and immunotherapy (2.1%). 57.5% of patients received osimertinib as a second line therapy. T790M mutation was detected in either plasma (46.8%) or tissue/cytology (42.6%) samples; sample type was unknown in 5 (10.6%) patients. At data cut‐off (15 Jun 2017), 22 patients were still on osimertinib therapy. Physician‐assessed RR was 53.2% (95% CI 38.1‐67.9%; 6.4% complete response; 46.8% partial response) and 38.3% had stable disease. Median PFS was 9.6 months (95% CI 5.6‐10.9 months). Frequency of all AEs and AEs grade >3 were 38.3% and 4.3%, respectively. Most common AEs were rash (14.9%), fatigue (12.8%), and nausea (10.6%). Pneumonitis was reported in 1 patient (2.1%). Conclusions: Real‐world physician‐assessed RR and PFS with osimertinib appear comparable to that reported in RCTs; no new safety signals were observed. Our data corroborate the findings of RCTs and suggest that osimertinib provides encouraging effectiveness and similar safety when used in real‐world clinical practice.},

abstract = {Background: Around one third of patients (pts) with NSCLC present with Stage III, locally advanced disease at initial diagnosis. Programmed death‐ligand 1 (PD‐L1) inhibitor, DUR, is the current standard of care for pts whose disease had not progressed following cCRT. Anti‐T cell immunoglobulin and immunoreceptor tyrosine‐based inhibitory motif domain (TIGIT) is a co‐inhibitory immune checkpoint receptor upregulated on T cells and natural killer cells in multiple solid tumors. OCI is a humanized mAb that binds TIGIT with high specificity and affinity, blocking interaction with its ligands on tumor cells. TIS is an anti‐PD‐1 antibody engineered to minimize binding to FcγR on macrophages to abrogate antibody‐dependent phagocytosis. Dual targeting with OCI and TIS produced synergistic immune cell activation and enhanced antitumor activity in preclinical models. Trial Design: AdvanTIG‐301 is a Phase 3, multicenter, international, randomized, open‐label study (NCT04866017) in adult pts with newly diagnosed, histologically confirmed, locally advanced, Stage III unresectable NSCLC. Approximately 900 pts will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive: two cycles of OCI 900 mg IV + TIS 200 mg IV Q3W + cCRT followed by OCI 900 mg IV + TIS 200 mg IV Q3W up to 1 year after cCRT (Arm A), two cycles of TIS 200 mg IV Q3W + cCRT followed by TIS 200 mg IV Q3W up to 1 year after cCRT (Arm B), two cycles of cCRT followed by DUR 10 mg/kg IV Q2W (or 1500 mg IV Q4W) up to 1 year after cCRT (Arm C). Key eligibility criteria include ECOG PS ≤1 and no EGFR and ALK mutation. Primary endpoints, all by Independent Review Committee (IRC; RECIST v1.1), are progression‐free survival (PFS) between Arm A and C, complete response rate between Arm A and C, and PFS between Arm B and C. Secondary endpoints include overall survival, IRC‐assessed PFS between Arm A and C in the PD‐L1‐positive population, and investigator‐assessed PFS, IRC‐ and investigator‐assessed overall response rate and duration of response (all between Arm A and B, Arm A and C and Arm B and C), and safety and tolerability.

abstract = {Background: Platinum‐based chemotherapy +/‐ an immune checkpoint inhibitor, the current standard of care in patients (pts) with RET+ NSCLC, does not account for underlying oncogenic drivers. In the LIBRETTO‐001 phase 1/2 trial, selpercatinib (Loxo‐292), a selective and potent RET inhibitor, demonstrated antitumor activity [objective response rate (ORR) 85%] with a tolerable profile in pts with Tx‐naïve, RET+ NSCLC. This global, open‐label, randomized, controlled, phase 3 trial will evaluate selpercatinib vs platinum‐based and pemetrexed (pem) Tx with or without pembrolizumab (+/‐pembro) in Tx‐naïve pts with advanced or metastatic RET+ non‐squamous NSCLC. Trial design: Pts will be randomized to Arm A: selpercatinib 160 mg BID in continuous 3 week (wk) cycles or Arm B: pem (500 mg/m2 IV) in 3 wk cycles plus investigator’s choice of carboplatin (carbo) (AUC 5) or cisplatin (cis) (75 mg/m2 IV) for 4 cycles. For Arm B, at the investigator’s discretion, pembro (200 mg IV) may also be given for up to 35 cycles and pts may receive maintenance pem +/‐pembro. Crossover is allowed for Arm B pts who progress. Tx will continue until PD, unacceptable toxicity, decision to withdraw or death. Stratification factors are geography: East vs non‐East Asian, brain metastases: yes vs no and intended Tx for Arm B: +/‐pembro. Eligibility criteria are age ≥18 years; Tx‐naïve; non‐squamous Stage IIIB‐IIIC not suitable for surgery/radiation therapy or Stage IV NSCLC; RET+ identification by PCR or NGS (tumor) or NGS (blood); measurable disease by RECIST 1.1; ECOG performance status 0‐2. Key exclusion criteria are presence of other oncogenic drivers or symptomatic CNS metastases. Efficacy assessments will be performed until PD, the start of a new anticancer Tx, death or study completion. The primary endpoint is progression free survival (PFS) per RECIST 1.1 by independent review. Investigator assessed PFS, ORR/duration of response (DOR), intracranial ORR/DOR, overall survival (OS), time to deterioration in pulmonary symptoms, PFS2, RET fusion status: local vs central, safety and pharmacokinetics are secondary endpoints.

abstract = {Background: PACIFIC established consolidation durvalumab (D) as SoC for unresectable Stage III NSCLC with no progression after cCRT. Combination therapy may improve outcomes. CD73 is involved in RT resistance. RT induces NKG2A ligand and shows additive antitumour effects with PD‐1 blockade preclinically. COAST (NCT03822351) is a global phase 2 study of D alone or combined with the anti‐CD73 mAb oleclumab (O) or anti‐NKG2A mAb monalizumab (M) as consolidation therapy. Methods: Pts with histologically/cytologically documented unresectable Stage III NSCLC, ECOG PS 0/1 and no progression after cCRT were randomised 1:1:1 ≤42 days post cCRT to receive D 1500 mg IV Q4W alone or combined with O 3000 mg IV Q2W (first 2 cycles, then Q4W) or M 750 mg IV Q2W for up to 12 months, stratified by histology. The primary endpoint was investigator‐assessed post cCRT ORR per RECIST v1.1. Key secondary endpoints included PFS and safety. Results: Between Jan 2019 and Jul 2020, 189 pts were randomised, of whom 186 received D (n=66), D+O (n=59) or D+M (n=61). As of 17 May 2021, median follow‐up was 11.5 months (range, 0.4–23.4; all pts). D+O and D+M numerically increased ORR (odds ratio [95% CI] 1.83 [0.80, 4.20] and 1.77 [0.77, 4.11] respectively) and significantly improved PFS versus D alone. Grade ≥3 treatment‐emergent AE (TEAE, all‐cause) incidence was 39.4%, 40.7% and 27.9% with D, D+O and D+M respectively. Overall, the most common grade 3/4 TEAEs were pneumonia (5.9%) and decreased lymphocyte count (3.2%); both were more common with D and D+O than with D+M. Combined rates of pneumonitis and radiation pneumonitis of any grade were 21.2% with D, 28.8% with D+O and 21.3% with D+M, with grade ≥3 events in 3.0%, 3.4% and 1.6%. Biomarker data will be presented. Conclusions: Addition of both novel agents improved ORR, PFS and 10‐month PFS rate over D alone. Safety was similar across arms with no new safety signals identified. [Formula presented] Clinical trial identification: NCT03822351 (release date: January 30, 2019).

abstract = {Background: NY‐ESO‐1 and LAGE‐1a are antigens expressed in several tumours, including non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Previous clinical trials using autologous T cells directed against NY‐ESO‐1/LAGE‐1a have shown objective responses between 40% and 60% in synovial sarcoma, metastatic melanoma and multiple myeloma. Pembrolizumab (PEM) is a monoclonal antibody that blocks PD‐1/PD‐L1 interaction and increases anti‐tumour activity in anti‐tumour T cells. Here, PEM will be used in combination with NY‐ESO‐1/LAGE‐1a T‐cell receptor engineered patient T cells (GSK3377794) to potentially improve clinical benefit in this patient population. Trial design: This is a phase Ib/IIa, randomised, multi‐arm, open‐label study (NCT03709706) of GSK3377794 in HLA‐A*02:01, HLA‐A*02:05 and/or HLA‐A*02:06 positive adults with NY‐ESO‐1 and/or LAGE‐1a‐expressing tumours. Eligible patients with unresectable Stage IIIb/IV NSCLC are either ineligible for standard‐of‐care chemoradiotherapy, have received PD‐1 therapy or appropriate targeted therapy, have terminated prior treatment due to intolerable side effects, or have refused standard approved treatment. At least 30 patients with NSCLC without EGFR or ALK/ROS1 aberrations will be randomised (1:1) to Arm A or B; at least 15 patients with EGFR or ALK/ROS1 aberration will be assigned to Arm C. Patients in Arm A will receive a single IV infusion of GSK3377794; those in Arms B and C will receive GSK3377794 IV on Day 1, then PEM 200 mg...},
