abstract = {Abstract - Background Mistletoe extracts are commonly used in cancer patients. It is claimed that they improve survival and quality of life (QOL) in cancer patients. Objectives To determine the effectiveness, tolerability and safety of mistletoe extracts given either as monotherapy or adjunct therapy for patients with cancer. Search methods Search sources included the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 3, 2007) Cochrane Complementary Medicine Field Registry of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, HEALTHSTAR, INT. HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT, SOMED, AMED, BIOETHICSLINE, BIOSIS, CancerLit, CATLINE, CISCOM (August 2007). For the search the Standard Operating Procedures of the Information System in Health Economics at the German Institute for Medical Documentation and Information (DIMDI) were utilized. Reference lists of relevant articles and authors extensive files were searched for additional studies. Manufacturers of mistletoe preparations were contacted. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of adults with cancer of any type. The interventions were mistletoe extracts as sole treatments or given concomitantly with chemo‐ or radiotherapy. The outcome measures were survival times, tumor response, QOL, psychological distress, adverse effects from antineoplastic treatment and safety of mistletoe extracts. Data collection and analysis Three review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion in the review. All review authors independently took part in the extraction of data and assessment of study quality and clinical relevance. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. Study authors were contacted where information was unclear. Methodological quality was narratively described and additionally assessed with the Delphi list and the Jadad score. High methodological quality was defined if six out of nine Delphi criteria, or four out of five Jadad criteria were fulfilled. Results were presented qualitatively. Main results Eighty studies were identified. Fifty‐eight were excluded for various reasons, usually as there was no prospective trial design with randomised treatment allocation. Of the 21 included studies 13 provided data on survival, 7 on tumour response, 16 on measures of QOL or psychological outcomes, or prevalence of chemotherapy‐related adverse effects and 12 on side effects of mistletoe treatment; overall comprising 3484 randomised cancer patients. Interventions evaluated were 5 preparations of mistletoe extracts from 5 manufacturers and one commercially not available preparation. The general reporting of RCTs was poor. Of the 13 trials investigating survival, 6 showed some evidence of a benefit, but none of them was of high methodological quality. The results of two trials in patients with melanoma and head and neck cancer gave some evidence that the used mistletoe extracts are not effective for improving survival. Of the 16 trials investigating the efficacy of mistletoe extracts for either improving QOL, psychological measures, performance index, symptom scales or the reduction of adverse effects of chemotherapy, 14 showed some evidence of a benefit, but only 2 of them including breast cancer patients during chemotherapy were of higher methodological quality. Data on side effects indicated that, depending on the dose, mistletoe extracts were usually well tolerated and had few side effects. Authors' conclusions The evidence from RCTs to support the view that the application of mistletoe extracts has impact on survival or leads to an improved ability to fight cancer or to withstand anticancer treatments is weak. Nevertheless, there is some evidence that mistletoe extracts may offer benefits on measures of QOL during chemotherapy for breast cancer, but these results need replication. Overall, more high quality, independent clinical research is needed to truly assess the safety and effectiveness of mistletoe extracts. Patients receiving mistletoe therapy should be encouraged to take part in future trails. Plain language summary Mistletoe treatment in cancer patients Preparations from the European mistletoe (Viscum album L.) are among the most prescribed drugs in cancer patients in several European countries. Proponents claim that mistletoe extracts stimulate the immune system, improve survival, enhance quality of life and reduce adverse effects of chemo‐ and radiotherapy in cancer patients. The review found that there was not enough evidence to reach clear conclusions about the effects on any of these outcomes and it is therefore not clear to what extent the application of mistletoe extracts translates into improved symptom control, enhanced tumour response or prolonged survival. Adverse effects of mistletoe extracts were reported, but appeared to be dose‐dependent and primarily confined to reactions at injection site and mild, transient flu‐like symptoms. In the absence of good quality, independent trials, decisions about whether mistletoe extracts are likely to be beneficial for a particular problem should rely on expert judgement and practical considerations.},

publisher = {John Wiley & Sons, Ltd},
ISSN = {1465-1858},
abstract = {Abstract - Background Patients with advanced lung cancer have a high symptom burden, which is often complicated by coexisting conditions. These issues, combined with the indirect effects of cancer treatment, can cumulatively lead patients to continued deconditioning and low exercise capacity. This is a concern as exercise capacity is considered a measure of whole body health, and is critical in a patient's ability to participate in life activities and tolerate difficult treatments. There is evidence that exercise training improves exercise capacity and other outcomes, such as muscle force and health‐related quality of life (HRQoL), in cancer survivors. However, the effectiveness of exercise training on these outcomes in people with advanced lung cancer is currently unclear. Objectives The primary aim of this review was to investigate the effects of exercise training on exercise capacity in adults with advanced lung cancer. Exercise capacity was defined as the six‐minute walk distance (6MWD; in meters) measured during a six‐minute walk test (6MWT; i.e. how far an individual can walk in six minutes on a flat course), or the peak oxygen uptake (i.e. VO₂peak) measured during a maximal incremental cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET). The secondary aims were to determine the effects of exercise training on the force‐generating capacity of peripheral muscles, disease‐specific global HRQoL, physical functioning component of HRQoL, dyspnoea, fatigue, feelings of anxiety and depression, lung function, level of physical activity, adverse events, performance status, body weight and overall survival in adults with advanced lung cancer. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE (via PubMed), Embase (via Ovid), CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, PEDro, and SciELO on 7 July 2018. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which compared exercise training versus no exercise training in adults with advanced lung cancer. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened the studies and selected those for inclusion. We performed meta‐analyses for the following outcomes: exercise capacity, disease‐specific global HRQoL, physical functioning HRQoL, dyspnoea, fatigue, feelings of anxiety and depression, and lung function (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 )). Two studies reported force‐generating capacity of peripheral muscles, and we presented the results narratively. Limited data were available for level of physical activity, adverse events, performance status, body weight and overall survival. Main results We identified six RCTs, involving 221 participants. The mean age of participants ranged from 59 to 70 years; the sample size ranged from 20 to 111 participants. Overall, we found that the risk of bias in the included studies was high, and the quality of evidence for all outcomes was low. Pooled data from four studies demonstrated that, on completion of the intervention period, exercise capacity (6MWD) was significantly higher in the intervention group than the control group (mean difference (MD) 63.33 m; 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.70 to 122.96). On completion of the intervention period, disease‐specific global HRQoL was significantly better in the intervention group compared to the control group (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.51; 95% CI 0.08 to 0.93). There was no significant difference between the intervention and control groups in physical functioning HRQoL (SMD 0.11; 95% CI ‐0.36 to 0.58), dyspnoea (SMD ‐0.27; 95% CI ‐0.64 to 0.10), fatigue (SMD 0.03; 95% CI ‐0.51 to 0.58), feelings of anxiety (MD ‐1.21 units on Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; 95% CI ‐5.88 to 3.45) and depression (SMD ‐1.26; 95% CI ‐4.68 to 2.17), and FEV 1  (SMD 0.43; 95% CI ‐0.11 to 0.97). Authors' conclusions Exercise training may improve or avoid the decline in exercise capacity and disease‐specific global HRQoL for adults with advanced lung cancer. We found no significant effects of exercise training on dyspnoea, fatigue, feelings of anxiety and depression, or lung function. The findings of this review should be viewed with caution because of the heterogeneity between studies, the small sample sizes, and the high risk of bias of included studies. Larger, high‐quality RCTs are needed to confirm and expand knowledge on the effects of exercise training in this population. Plain language summary Exercise training for advanced lung cancer Review question We looked at the effect of exercise training on fitness level, muscle strength, quality of life, shortness of breath, tiredness, feelings of anxiety and depression, and lung function in patients with advanced lung cancer. Background Patients with advanced lung cancer often have many symptoms and accompanying diseases. This, combined with side‐effects of cancer treatment, leads patients to become less fit. This is concerning as fitness level is a measure of whole body health, and is critical in a patient's ability to participate in life activities and tolerate difficult treatments. Exercise training has been shown to improve fitness, muscle strength and quality of life in survivors of several types of cancers. However, the effect of exercise training on these outcomes in people with advanced lung cancer is not clear. Study characteristics We looked for all research studies (randomised controlled trials) published up to July 2018. We found six studies which included 221 participants, with an average age ranging from 59 to 70 years. These studies included different numbers of people, ranging from 20 to 111. Key results Our results showed that, compared to those who did not exercise, people with lung cancer who did exercise were fitter and had a better quality of life. We did not find any difference in muscle strength, shortness of breath, tiredness, feelings of anxiety and depression, or lung function. No serious harms were reported in people with lung cancer who exercised, but only three studies talked about harms. Quality of the evidence The results of this review are not clear, mainly because of the small number of studies found, the small numbers of people in those studies, and because the studies did not seem to have been carried out to a high standard.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Combination chemotherapy has been the mainstay of treatment for extensive stage small celI lung cancer (SCLC) over the last 30 years, even though it only gives a short prolongation in median survival time. The main goal for these patients should be palliation with the aim of improving their quality of life. Objectives To determine the effectiveness of first‐line chemotherapy versus placebo or best supportive care (BSC) in prolonging survival in patients with extensive SCLC at diagnosis and the effectiveness of second‐line chemotherapy at relapse or progression after first‐line chemotherapy compared with BSC or placebo in prolonging survival in patients with extensive SCLC; as well as to evaluate the adverse events of treatment and the quality of life of patients. Search methods This is the second update of the review. MEDLINE (1966 to October 2013), EMBASE (1974 to October 2013), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2012, Issue 3) were searched. Experts in the field were contacted. Selection criteria Phase III randomised controlled trials in which any chemotherapy treatment was compared with  placebo or BSC in patients with extensive SCLC, as first‐line or second‐line therapy at relapse. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently extracted data and assessed study quality. We resolved disagreements by discussion. Additional information was obtained from one study author. Main results Two studies of unclear risk of bias were included for first‐line chemotherapy. A total of 88 men under 70 years with good performance status were randomised to receive either supportive care, placebo infusion or ifosfamide. Ifosfamide gave an extra mean survival of 78.5 days compared with supportive care or placebo infusion. Partial tumour response was greater with the active treatment. Toxicity was only seen in the chemotherapy group and quality of life was only assessed at the beginning of treatment. The quality of the evidence for overall survival and adverse effects was very low. Three studies of moderate risk of bias were included for second‐line chemotherapy at relapse (one identified in the last search). A total of 932 men and women under 75 years and any performance status were randomised to receive either methotrexate‐doxorubicin, topotecan, or picoplatin versus symptomatic treatment or BSC. The methotrexate‐doxorubicin treatment gave a median survival of 63 days longer than in the symptomatic‐treatment group for patients allocated to receive four cycles of first‐line chemotherapy, and 21 days longer for patients allocated to receive eight cycles of first‐line chemotherapy. Treatment with topotecan gave a median survival of 84 days longer than in the BSC group (log‐rank P = 0.01). The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival was 0.61 (95% CI 0.43 to 0.87). Treatment with picoplatin gave a median survival time of six days longer than BSC (HR 0.817, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.03, P = 0.0895). A meta‐analysis of topotecan and picoplatin gave a HR of 0.73 (95% CI 0.55 to 0.96, P = 0.03; low‐quality evidence). Partial or complete response in the methotrexate‐doxorubicin group was 22.3%. Five patients (7%, 95% CI 2.33 to 15.67) showed a partial response with topotecan. No data were provided about tumour response in the picoplatin study. Toxicity was worst in the chemotherapy group (moderate‐quality evidence). Quality of life was better in the topotecan group and was not measured in the methotrexate‐doxorubicin and picoplatin studies (low‐quality evidence). Authors' conclusions   Two small RCTs from the 1970s suggest that first‐line chemotherapeutic treatment (based on ifosfamide) may provide a small survival benefit (less than three months) in comparison with supportive care or placebo infusion in patients with advanced SCLC. However platinum‐based combination chemotherapy regimens have been shown to increase complete response rates when compared to non‐platinum chemotherapy regimens with no significant difference in survival, and so these are currently the standard first‐line treatment for patients with SCLC. Second‐line chemotherapy at relapse or progression may prolong survival for some weeks in relation to BSC. Nevertheless, the impact of first‐line chemotherapy on quality of life, older patients, women and patients with poor prognosis is unknown and the benefits of second‐line chemotherapy are also unclear for older people. Globally, the evidence on which these conclusions are based is very scarce and of uncertain or low quality, which calls for well‐designed, controlled trials to further evaluate the trade‐offs between benefits and risks of different chemotherapeutic schedules in patients with advanced SCLC. Plain language summary Chemotherapy (anticancer drugs) for patients with advanced small cell lung cancer SmalI cell lung cancer accounts for nearly a quarter of all new cases of lung cancer. This cancer is often diagnosed in an advanced stage, which means that it has spread to the brain, liver, bone or bone marrow, and most patients die in the first year after diagnosis. This review found that first‐line chemotherapy (anticancer drugs) may prolong the survival of patients with advanced small cell lung cancer for some months when compared to supportive care, although the effect of this treatment on quality of life is unknown. The benefit of a new treatment (second‐line chemotherapy) when the disease has progressed or relapsed was even smaller, and the potential survival gain of some weeks must be balanced against its possible secondary effects. Since the available studies were scarce and of variable quality, more clinical trials are needed to assess and better inform patients about the real effectiveness of chemotherapy in advanced small cell lung cancer.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background New strategies in immunotherapy with specific antigens that trigger an anti‐tumour immune response in people with lung cancer open the possibility of developing therapeutic vaccines aimed at boosting the adaptive immune response against cancer cells. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of different types of therapeutic vaccines for people with advanced non‐small cell lung cancer. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Wanfang Data, and China Journal Net (CNKI) up to 22 August 2023. Selection criteria We included parallel‐group, randomised controlled trials evaluating a therapeutic cancer vaccine, alone or in combination with other treatments, in adults (> 18 years) with advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), whatever the line of treatment. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were overall survival, progression‐free survival, and serious adverse events; secondary outcomes were three‐ and five‐year survival rates and health‐related quality of life. Main results We included 10 studies with 2177 participants. The outcome analyses included only 2045 participants (1401 men and 644 women). The certainty of the evidence varied by vaccine and outcome, and ranged from moderate to very low. We report only the results for primary outcomes here. TG4010 The addition of the vector‐based vaccine, TG4010, to chemotherapy, compared with chemotherapy alone in first‐line treatment, may result in little to no difference in overall survival (hazard ratio (HR) 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65 to 1.05; 2 studies, 370 participants; low‐certainty evidence). It may increase progression‐free survival slightly (HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.99; 1 study, 222 participants; low‐certainty evidence). It may result in little to no difference in the proportion of participants with at least one serious treatment‐related adverse event, but the evidence is very uncertain (risk ratio (RR) 0.70, 95% CI 0.23 to 2.19; 2 studies, 362 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Epidermal growth factor vaccine Epidermal growth factor vaccine, compared to best supportive care as switch maintenance treatment after first‐line chemotherapy, may result in little to no difference in overall survival (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.02; 1 study, 378 participants; low‐certainty evidence), and in the proportion of participants with at least one serious treatment‐related adverse event (RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.98; 2 studies, 458 participants; low‐certainty evidence). hTERT (vx‐001) The hTERT (vx‐001) vaccine compared to placebo as maintenance treatment after first‐line chemotherapy may result in little to no difference in overall survival (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.34; 1 study, 190 participants). Racotumomab Racotumomab compared to placebo as a switch maintenance treatment post‐chemotherapy was assessed in one study with 176 participants. It may increase overall survival (HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.87). It may make little to no difference in progression‐free survival (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.00) and in the proportion of people with at least one serious treatment‐related adverse event (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.15 to 7.18). Racotumomab versus docetaxel as switch maintenance therapy post‐chemotherapy was assessed in one study with 145 participants. The study did not report hazard rates on overall survival or progression‐free survival time, but the difference in median survival times was very small – less than one month. Racotumomab may result in little to no difference in the proportion of people with at least one serious treatment‐related adverse event compared with docetaxel (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.83). Personalised peptide vaccine Personalised peptide vaccine plus docetaxel compared to docetaxel plus placebo post‐chemotherapy treatment may result in little to no difference in overall survival (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.52) and progression‐free survival (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.42). OSE2101 The OSE2101 vaccine compared with chemotherapy, after chemotherapy or immunotherapy, was assessed in one study with 219 participants. It may result in little to no difference in overall survival (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.19). It may result in a small difference in the proportion of people with at least one serious treatment‐related adverse event (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.91 to 0.99). SRL172 The SRL172 vaccine of killed  Mycobacterium vaccae , added to chemotherapy, compared to chemotherapy alone, may result in no difference in overall survival, and may increase the proportion of people with at least one serious treatment‐related adverse event (RR 2.07, 95% CI 1.76 to 2.43; 351 participants). Authors' conclusions Adding a vaccine resulted in no differences in overall survival, except for racotumomab, which showed some improvement compared to placebo, but the difference in median survival time was very small (1.4 months) and the study only included 176 participants. Regarding progression‐free survival, we observed no differences between the compared treatments, except for TG4010, which may increase progression‐free survival slightly. There were no differences between the compared treatments in serious treatment‐related adverse events, except for SRL172 (killed  Mycobacterium vaccae ) added to chemotherapy, which was associated with an increase in the proportion of participants with at least one serious treatment‐related adverse event, and OSE2101, which may decrease slightly the proportion of people having at least one serious treatment‐related adverse event. These conclusions should be interpreted cautiously, as the very low‐ to moderate‐certainty evidence prevents drawing solid conclusions: many vaccines were evaluated in a single study with small numbers of participants and events. Plain language summary Do cancer vaccines help people with advanced non‐small cell lung cancer? Key messages ‐ The vaccines evaluated in this review do not improve peoples' survival, or progression‐free survival, or do so to a negligible extent. ‐ Unwanted effects of the vaccines are not frequent. What is lung cancer? Lung cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide. Non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer, accounting for around 87% of lung cancers. Non‐small cell lung cancer is often diagnosed when it is at an advanced stage, which is associated with high death rates and a short life expectancy. How is non‐small cell lung cancer treated? Most of these cancers are treated first with chemotherapy – that is, medicine consisting of powerful chemicals to kill fast‐growing cancer cells. New therapies to improve survival rates for people with NSCLC are focused on treatment with immunotherapy after chemotherapy. Cancer vaccines are a type of immunotherapy. Unlike vaccines to protect us from disease, cancer vaccines are for people who already have cancer. Therapeutic cancer vaccines aim to stimulate the immune system to recognise and destroy cancer cells. What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out whether vaccines lengthen people's survival time and time without disease progression, and whether they are associated with any unwanted effects. What did we do? We searched for studies that looked at therapeutic cancer vaccines alone or in combination with chemotherapy compared with supportive care, no treatment, or placebo (inactive or 'dummy' medicine) in people with advanced NSCLC. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. What did we find? We found 10 studies that involved 2177 participants with advanced NSCLC. The biggest study involved 419 people and the smallest study 50. Seven different types of vaccines were evaluated. Three vaccines were evaluated in 2 studies each: TG4010 vector‐based vaccine; epidermal growth factor vaccine; and racotumomab. The remaining 4 vaccines were each evaluated in a single study. Main results ‐ None of the vaccines increased participants' survival time, except racotumomab, which may improve it slightly compared to placebo. The median survival time for those in the racotumomab vaccine group was 8.2 months, compared to 6.8 months in the group that did not receive the vaccine. (The median is the middle value of a set of numbers.) ‐ None of the vaccines improved progression‐free survival time, except TG4010, which may increase it slightly. The median progression‐free survival time for people in the TG4010 vaccine group was 5.9 months, compared to 5.1 months in the non‐vaccine group. ‐ The 7 different vaccines tested largely appear to be safe: there were no differences between the people given vaccines and those not given vaccines in terms of serious adverse (unwanted) events. However, 1 vaccine (SLR172) added to chemotherapy increased the proportion of people having at least 1 serious adverse event. A different vaccine (OSE2101) may result in a slight decrease in the proportion of people having at least 1 serious adverse event. What are the limitations of the evidence? Our confidence in the evidence varied from moderate to very low for the different vaccines and outcomes assessed, mainly because the studies were small and there were not enough studies to be sure of the results. How up to date is this evidence? The evidence is current to August 2023.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common lung cancer, accounting for approximately 80% to 85% of all cases. For people with localised NSCLC (stages I to III), it has been speculated that immunotherapy may be helpful for reducing postoperative recurrence rates, or improving the clinical outcomes of current treatment for unresectable tumours. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2017 and it includes two new randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Objectives To assess the effectiveness and safety of immunotherapy (excluding checkpoint inhibitors) among  people  with localised NSCLC of stages I to III who received curative intent of radiotherapy or surgery. Search methods We searched the following databases (from inception to 19 May 2021): CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and five trial registers. We also searched conference proceedings and reference lists of included trials. Selection criteria We included RCTs conducted in adults (≥ 18 years) diagnosed with  NSCLC stage I to III after surgical resection, and those with unresectable locally advanced stage III NSCLC receiving radiotherapy with curative intent. We included participants who underwent primary surgical treatment, postoperative radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy if the same strategy was provided for both intervention and control groups. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected eligible trials, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. We used survival analysis to pool time‐to‐event data, using hazard ratios (HRs). We used risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous data, and mean differences (MDs) for continuous data, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Due to clinical heterogeneity (immunotherapeutic agents with different underlying mechanisms), we combined data by applying random‐effects models. Main results We included 11 RCTs involving 5128 participants (this included 2 new trials with 188 participants since the last search dated 20 January 2017). Participants who underwent surgical resection or received curative radiotherapy were randomised to either an immunotherapy group or a control group. The immunological interventions were active immunotherapy Bacillus Calmette‐Guérin (BCG) adoptive cell transfer (i.e. transfer factor (TF), tumour‐infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), dendritic cell/cytokine‐induced killer (DC/CIK), antigen‐specific cancer vaccines (melanoma‐associated antigen 3 (MAGE‐A3) and L‐BLP25), and targeted natural killer (NK) cells. Seven trials were at high risk of bias for at least one of the risk of bias domains. Three trials were at low risk of bias across all domains and one small trial was at unclear risk of bias as it provided insufficient information. We included data from nine of the 11 trials in the meta‐analyses involving 4863 participants. There was no evidence of a difference between the immunotherapy agents and the controls on any of the following outcomes: overall survival (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.05; P = 0.27; 4 trials, 3848 participants; high‐quality evidence), progression‐free survival (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.03; P = 0.19; moderate‐quality evidence), adverse events (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.28; P = 0.11; 4 trials, 4126 evaluated participants; low‐quality evidence), and severe adverse events (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.40; 6 trials, 4546 evaluated participants; low‐quality evidence).  Survival rates at different time points showed no evidence of a difference between immunotherapy agents and the controls. Survival rate at 1‐year follow‐up (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.08; I 2  = 57%; 7 trials, 4420 participants; low‐quality evidence), 2‐year follow‐up (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.12; 7 trials, 4420 participants; moderate‐quality evidence), 3‐year follow‐up (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.09; 7 trials, 4420 participants; I 2  = 22%; moderate‐quality evidence) and at 5‐year follow‐up (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.12; I 2  = 0%; 7 trials, 4389 participants; moderate‐quality evidence).  Only one trial reported overall response rates. Two trials provided health‐related quality of life results with contradicting results.  Authors' conclusions Based on this updated review, the current literature does not provide evidence that suggests a survival benefit from adding immunotherapy (excluding checkpoint inhibitors) to conventional curative surgery or radiotherapy, for people with localised NSCLC (stages I to III). Several ongoing trials with immune checkpoints inhibitors (PD‐1/PD‐L1) might bring new insights into the role of immunotherapy for people with stages I to III NSCLC.  Plain language summary Effect of immunotherapy on the prognosis for stages I to III non‐small cell lung cancer treated with surgery or radiotherapy with curative intent Review question Do treatments that help the body's immune system fight cancer cells (immunotherapy) make people with non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have had surgery or radiotherapy aimed at a cure, live longer? Background Many people with NSCLC, who have had surgery or radiotherapy to cure their cancer, eventually die because the cancer comes back, either in the chest, or somewhere else in the body. There have been a number of trials over the years that have looked at whether immunotherapy helps people live longer. Some seemed to show a benefit, others did not. Study characteristics We searched four computerised databases and five trial registers to 19 May 2021. We looked for all trials that randomly allocated participants to one treatment or another (randomised controlled trials, RCTs), and included adults (aged 18 years or older) with early NSCLC (stages I to III), confirmed by laboratory testing of a sample of the tumour. We found 11 RCTs, which included over 5000 participants who had received surgery or curative radiotherapy, and were randomly allocated to receive either immunotherapy or no further treatment.  Key results We found that giving immunotherapy, mainly vaccine‐based (aiming to activate the host immune system to induce human immune response to tumour‐specific antigens), after surgery or radiotherapy did not make people live longer. People who were given vaccine‐based immunotherapy did not seem to experience more side effects than the others. We did not find results that could tell us whether the addition of immunotherapy improved quality of life. At the moment, there is no evidence to support or refute giving immunotherapy (mainly vaccine‐based) to people with localised NSCLC (stages I to III). RCTs in progress are testing new, more promising immunotherapy drugs (e.g. checkpoint inhibitors).  Quality of the evidence The evidence we found about overall survival and progression‐free survival was of high and moderate quality, respectively. When we looked for evidence about how many participants lived to one, two, three, or five years, it was only moderate or low quality, because the RCTs were not very well done, and their results did not agree with each other. The evidence for both any and severe adverse events was of low quality.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Lung cancer is a cancer of the elderly, with a median age at diagnosis of 71. More than one‐third of people diagnosed with lung cancer are over 75 years old. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are special antibodies that target a pathway in the immune system called the programmed cell death 1/programmed cell death‐ligand 1 (PD‐1/PD‐L1) pathway. These antibodies help the immune system fight cancer cells by blocking signals that cancer cells use to avoid being attacked by the immune system. ICIs have changed the treatment of people with lung cancer. In particular, for people with previously‐untreated advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), current first‐line treatment now comprises ICIs plus platinum‐based chemotherapy, rather than platinum‐based chemotherapy alone, regardless of their PD‐L1 expression status. However, as people age, their immune system changes, becoming less effective in its T cell responses. This raises questions about how well ICIs work in older adults. Objectives To assess the effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in combination with platinum‐based chemotherapy compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy (with or without bevacizumab) in treatment‐naïve adults aged 65 years and older with advanced NSCLC. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Lung Cancer Group Trial Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two other trial registers, and the websites of drug regulators. The latest search date was 23 August 2023. We also checked references and searched abstracts from the meetings of seven cancer organisations from 2019 to August 2023. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that reported on the efficacy and safety of adding ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy alone for people 65 years and older who had not previously been treated. All data emanated from international multicentre studies involving adults with histologically‐confirmed advanced NSCLC who had not received any previous systemic anticancer therapy for their advanced disease. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were overall survival and treatment‐related adverse events (grade 3 or higher). Our secondary outcomes were progression‐free survival, objective response rate, time to response, duration of response, and health‐related quality of life (HRQoL). Main results We included 17 primary studies, with a total of 4276 participants, in the review synthesis. We identified nine ongoing studies, and listed one study as 'awaiting classification'. Twelve of the 17 studies included people older than 75 years, accounting for 9% to 13% of their participants. We rated some studies as having 'some concerns' for risk of bias arising from the randomisation process, deviations from the intended interventions, or measurement of the outcome. The overall GRADE rating for the certainty of the evidence ranged from moderate to low because of the risk of bias, imprecision, or inconsistency. People aged 65 years and older The addition of ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy probably increased overall survival compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy alone (hazard ratio (HR) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70 to 0.88; 8 studies, 2093 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Only one study reported data for treatment‐related adverse events (grade 3 or higher). The frequency of treatment‐related adverse events may not differ between the two treatment groups (risk ratio (RR) 1.09, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.32; 1 study, 127 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The addition of ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy probably improves progression‐free survival (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.68; 7 studies, 1885 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). People aged 65 to 75 years, inclusive The addition of ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy probably improved overall survival compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy alone (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.87; 6 studies, 1406 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Only one study reported data for treatment‐related adverse events (grade 3 or higher). The frequency of treatment‐related adverse events probably increased in people treated with ICIs plus platinum‐based chemotherapy compared to those treated with platinum‐based chemotherapy alone (RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.13; 1 study, 97 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). The addition of ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy probably improved progression‐free survival (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.73; 8 studies, 1466 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). People aged 75 years and older There may be no difference in overall survival in people treated with ICIs combined with platinum‐based chemotherapy compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy alone (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.16; 4 studies, 297 participants; low‐certainty evidence). No data on treatment‐related adverse events were available in this age group. The effect of combination ICI and platinum‐based chemotherapy on progression‐free survival is uncertain (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.36; 3 studies, 226 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Only three studies assessed the objective response rate. For time to response, duration of response, and health‐related quality of life, we do not have any evidence yet. Authors' conclusions Compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy alone, adding ICIs to platinum‐based chemotherapy probably leads to higher overall survival and progression‐free survival, without an increase in treatment‐related adverse events (grade 3 or higher), in people 65 years and older with advanced NSCLC. These data are based on results from studies dominated by participants between 65 and 75 years old. However, the analysis also suggests that the improvements reported in overall survival and progression‐free survival may not be seen in people older than 75 years. Plain language summary Is immunotherapy plus chemotherapy better than chemotherapy alone for older people with non‐small cell lung cancer? Key messages • For people 65 years and older with advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have not previously been treated for cancer, adding immunotherapy to chemotherapy prolongs life and extends the time before their cancer progresses. This finding comes from studies that mainly included people between 65 and 75 years old. • We did not find these same beneficial effects of adding immunotherapy to chemotherapy in people over 75 years old. What is advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)? NSCLC is one of two main types of lung cancer. About 80% to 85% of lung cancer cases are NSCLC. It mainly affects older people: diagnosis occurs at an average age of 71. NSCLC is usually detected when it is at the metastatic, or advanced, stage, which means cancer has spread beyond the original affected lung. At this stage, it can't be cured, but treatment can help to control it, and improve symptoms and quality of life. How is NSCLC treated? Treatment options vary, depending on the cancer stage, tumour characteristics, and other factors. Chemotherapy – powerful chemicals that kill cancer cells – has been the mainstay of lung cancer treatment. Immunotherapies are newer treatments that can help the immune system fight cancer. They have had positive results when combined with chemotherapy for people with advanced lung cancer. However, as people age, their immune system changes, becoming less effective at fighting cancer. This is called immunosenescence. What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out if, in this context of immunosenescence, immunotherapies are effective for people 65 years and older with advanced NSCLC, and what are the effects of intensifying chemotherapy‐based treatment with the addition of immunotherapy. What did we do? We searched for studies that investigated the effect of giving chemotherapy plus immunotherapy versus chemotherapy alone to people 65 years and older with advanced NSCLC who had not previously had cancer treatment. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. What did we find? We found 17 studies with a total of 4276 people eligible for inclusion in this review. The studies compared immunotherapy plus chemotherapy to chemotherapy alone for people 65 years and older with previously untreated advanced NSCLC. Twelve of 17 studies included people older than 75 years, but this age group represented only 9% to 13% of all participants in the studies. • For people 65 years and older, adding immunotherapy to chemotherapy prolonged life and extended the time before cancer progression, compared to chemotherapy alone. Both treatments had the same rate of toxic effects. Most of the people included in these studies were between 65 and 75 years old. • For people 75 years and older, adding immunotherapy to chemotherapy may not prolong life or extend the time before cancer progression compared to chemotherapy alone. What are the limitations of the evidence? Our confidence in the evidence varied from moderate to very low, and was reduced because of concerns about how some of the studies were conducted. Only one study assessed some of the outcomes we were interested in. None of the studies assessed people's health‐related quality of life. How up to date is this evidence? The evidence is current to 23 August 2023.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Anticoagulation may improve survival in patients with cancer through a speculated anti‐tumour effect, in addition to the antithrombotic effect, although may increase the risk of bleeding. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy and safety of parenteral anticoagulants in ambulatory patients with cancer who, typically, are undergoing chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy or radiotherapy, but otherwise have no standard therapeutic or prophylactic indication for anticoagulation. Search methods A comprehensive search included (1) a major electronic search (February 2016) of the following databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2016, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1946 to February 2016; accessed via OVID) and Embase (1980 to February 2016; accessed via OVID); (2) handsearching of conference proceedings; (3) checking of references of included studies; (4) use of the 'related citation' feature in PubMed and (5) a search for ongoing studies in trial registries. As part of the living systematic review approach, we are running searches continually and we will incorporate new evidence rapidly after it is identified. This update of the systematic review is based on the findings of a literature search conducted on 14 August 2017. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the benefits and harms of parenteral anticoagulation in ambulatory patients with cancer. Typically, these patients are undergoing chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy or radiotherapy, but otherwise have no standard therapeutic or prophylactic indication for anticoagulation. Data collection and analysis Using a standardized form we extracted data in duplicate on study design, participants, interventions outcomes of interest, and risk of bias. Outcomes of interested included all‐cause mortality, symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE), symptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), major bleeding, minor bleeding, and quality of life. We assessed the certainty of evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach (GRADE handbook [GRADE handbook]). Main results Of 6947 identified citations, 19 RCTs fulfilled the eligibility criteria. These trials enrolled 9650 participants. Trial registries' searches identified nine registered but unpublished trials, two of which were labeled as 'ongoing trials'. In all included RCTs, the intervention consisted of heparin (either unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin). Overall, heparin appears to have no effect on mortality at 12 months (risk ratio (RR) 0.98; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 1.03; risk difference (RD) 10 fewer per 1000; 95% CI 35 fewer to 15 more; moderate certainty of evidence) and mortality at 24 months (RR 0.99; 95% CI 0.96 to 1.01; RD 8 fewer per 1000; 95% CI 31 fewer to 8 more; moderate certainty of evidence). Heparin therapy reduces the risk of symptomatic VTE (RR 0.56; 95% CI 0.47 to 0.68; RD 30 fewer per 1000; 95% CI 36 fewer to 22 fewer; high certainty of evidence), while it increases in the risks of major bleeding (RR 1.30; 95% 0.94 to 1.79; RD 4 more per 1000; 95% CI 1 fewer to 11 more; moderate certainty of evidence) and minor bleeding (RR 1.70; 95% 1.13 to 2.55; RD 17 more per 1000; 95% CI 3 more to 37 more; high certainty of evidence). Results failed to confirm or to exclude a beneficial or detrimental effect of heparin on thrombocytopenia (RR 0.69; 95% CI 0.37 to 1.27; RD 33 fewer per 1000; 95% CI 66 fewer to 28 more; moderate certainty of evidence); quality of life (moderate certainty of evidence). Authors' conclusions Heparin appears to have no effect on mortality at 12 months and 24 months. It reduces symptomatic VTE and likely increases major and minor bleeding. Future research should further investigate the survival benefit of different types of anticoagulants in patients with different types and stages of cancer. The decision for a patient with cancer to start heparin therapy should balance the benefits and downsides, and should integrate the patient's values and preferences.

Plain language summary Injectable blood thinners (anticoagulants) in patients with cancer Background  Research evidence suggests that blood thinners may improve the survival of patients with cancer, by preventing life‐threatening blood clots and might also have a direct anticancer effect. However, blood thinners can also increase the risk of bleeding, which can be serious and reduce survival. It is therefore important to understand the pros and cons of treatment to allow patients and their doctors to be aware of the balance of risks and benefits. Study characteristics  We searched the scientific literature for studies of anticoagulants in people with cancer. The evidence is current to 14 August 2017. We included 19 eligible trials. Key results  We selected 19 trials including 9650 participants with cancer. Most trials included participants with various types of cancer, especially small cell lung cancer, non‐small cell lung cancer, and pancreatic cancer. All studies were conducted in the outpatient setting. The results suggest that the effect of injectable blood thinners on survival is uncertain, but if anything of small size. Also the results suggest that injectable blood thinners reduce the risk of blood clots by about half and possibly increase the risk of major bleeding and minor bleeding by 4 more per 1000 and 17 more per 1000, respectively. The effect on quality of life is uncertain. Certainty of evidence  We judged the certainty of evidence to be high for symptomatic VTE and minor bleeding, and moderate for mortality, major bleeding and quality of life.

Objectives To evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral anticoagulants in ambulatory people with cancer undergoing chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, or radiotherapy (either alone or in combination), with no standard therapeutic or prophylactic indication for anticoagulation. Search methods We conducted comprehensive searches on 14 June 2021, following the original electronic searches performed in February 2016 (last major search). We electronically searched the following databases: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase. In addition, we handsearched conference proceedings, checked references of included studies, and searched for ongoing studies. As part of the living systematic review approach, we are running continual searches and will incorporate new evidence rapidly after it is identified. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the benefits and harms of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) or direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in ambulatory people with cancer (i.e., not hospital inpatients during the time of their participation in trials) These people are typically undergoing systemic anticancer therapy, possibly including chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, or radiotherapy, but otherwise have no standard therapeutic or prophylactic indication for anticoagulation. Data collection and analysis Using a standardised form, two review authors independently extracted data on study design, participants, intervention outcomes of interest, and risk of bias. Outcomes of interest included all‐cause mortality, pulmonary embolism, symptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT), major bleeding, minor bleeding and health‐related quality of life. We assessed the certainty of evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach. Main results Of 12,620 identified citations, 10 RCTs fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The oral anticoagulant was a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) in six of these RCTs, and a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) in the remaining four RCTs (three studies used apixaban; one used rivaroxaban). The comparator was either placebo or no prophylaxis. Compared to no prophylaxis, vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) probably reduce mortality at six months slightly (risk ratio (RR) 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77 to 1.13; risk difference (RD) 22 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 72 fewer to 41 more; moderate‐certainty evidence), and probably reduce mortality at 12 months slightly (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.03; RD 29 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 75 fewer to 17 more; moderate‐certainty evidence). One study assessed the effect of a VKA compared to no prophylaxis on thrombosis; the evidence was very uncertain about the effect of VKA compared to no VKA on pulmonary embolism and symptomatic DVT (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.07 to 16.58; RD 0 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 6 fewer to 98 more; very low‐certainty evidence; RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.42; RD 35 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 37 fewer to 16 more; very low‐certainty evidence, respectively). Also, VKAs probably increase major and minor bleeding at 12 months (RR 2.93, 95% CI 1.86 to 4.62; RD 107 more per 1000, 95% CI 48 more to 201 more; moderate‐certainty evidence for major bleeding, and RR 3.14, 95% CI 1.85 to 5.32; RD 167 more per 1000, 95% CI 66 more to 337 more; moderate‐certainty evidence for minor bleeding). Compared to no prophylaxis, at three to six months, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) probably reduce mortality slightly (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.38, RD 11 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 67 fewer to 70 more; moderate‐certainty evidence), probably reduce the risk of pulmonary embolism slightly compared to no prophylaxis (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.98; RD 24 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 35 fewer to 1 fewer; moderate‐certainty evidence), probably reduce symptomatic DVT slightly (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.15; RD 21 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 35 fewer to 8 more; moderate‐certainty evidence), probably do not increase major bleeding (RR 1.65, 95% CI 0.72 to 3.80; RD 9 more per 1000, 95% CI 4 fewer to 40 more; moderate‐certainty evidence), and may increase minor bleeding (RR 3.58, 95% CI 0.55 to 23.44; RD 55 more per 1000, 95% CI 10 fewer to 482 more; low‐certainty evidence). Authors' conclusions In ambulatory people with cancer undergoing chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, or radiotherapy (either alone or in combination), the current evidence on VKA thromboprophylaxis suggests that the harm of major bleeding might outweigh the benefit of reduction in venous thromboembolism. With DOACs, the benefit of reduction in venous thromboembolic events outweighs the risk of major bleeding. Editorial note: this is a living systematic review.

Please refer to the 'What's new' section in the  Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for the current status of this review. Plain language summary Are oral blood thinners safe and effective for people being treated for cancer? Key messages ‐ It is reasonable to give direct oral anticoagulants (a type of blood thinning medicine) to people being treated for cancer, especially if they have an increased risk of blood clots, because the benefit of reduction in blood clots appears to outweigh the risk of major bleeding. ‐ For a different type of blood thinner, vitamin K antagonists (warfarin), the risk of major bleeding might outweigh the benefit of a reduction in formation of blood clots in the legs and lungs. ‐ More research is needed on the effects of blood thinners in people with different types and stages of cancers. What are blood thinners Blood thinners are medicines that help prevent blood from clotting. People at a high risk of getting blood clots can take blood thinners to reduce their chances of developing serious conditions such as heart attacks and strokes. Why might blood‐thinning treatment be helpful for people with cancer? People with cancer undergoing systemic treatment (any medication that travels through your body in the bloodstream to find, damage or destroy cancer cells, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy and target therapy) are at increased risk of blood clots. While blood thinners can decrease the risk of getting blood clots, they can also increase the risk of serious and fatal bleeding. Therefore, it is important to understand the benefits and harms of using blood thinners in these people to allow them and their doctors to make informed decisions. What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out if giving preventative, oral (by mouth) blood thinners was better than no preventative treatment for people being treated for cancer. We focused on people with cancer who were not admitted to hospital for their cancer treatment. We were interested in the effects of blood thinners on: ‐ death; ‐ formation of blood clots in veins (venous thromboembolism). Venous thromboembolism includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT) where a clot lodges in the lower leg, thigh or pelvis, and pulmonary embolism where a clot lodges in the lungs; ‐ major and minor bleeding. What did we do? We searched for studies that examined the benefits and harms of blood thinners for people being treated for cancer who otherwise had no signs, symptoms or conditions that suggested blood thinning was definitely needed. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. What did we find? We found 10 studies that involved 2934 people with cancer. The biggest study had 841 people and the smallest had 24 people. The studies used two types of blood thinner: ‐ the vitamin K antagonist, warfarin; or ‐ direct [ER1] oral anticoagulants (specifically, apixaban and rivaroxaban). Main results Compared to no preventative treatment, warfarin, the vitamin K antagonist medicine: ‐ probably reduces death at 6 months and at 12 months slightly (22 and 29 fewer deaths, respectively, per 1000 people); ‐ may have little to no effect on formation of blood clots, but we are very uncertain about the results; ‐ probably increases major bleeding and minor bleeding at 12 months (107 more major bleeds and 167 more minor bleeds per 1000 people). Compared to no preventative treatment, direct oral anticoagulant medicines: ‐ probably reduce death at 3 to 6 months slightly (11 fewer deaths per 1000 people); ‐ probably reduce blood clots in the lungs and legs slightly (24 fewer in the lungs and 19 fewer in the legs per 1000 people); ‐ probably do not increase major bleeding (9 more major bleeds per 1000 people); ‐ may increase minor bleeding (55 more minor bleeds per 1000 people). This suggests that : with a vitamin K antagonist, the risk of major bleeding might outweigh the benefit of any reduction in the risk of blood clots in the legs and lungs; with direct oral anticoagulants, the benefit of reduction in the risk of blood clots in the legs and lungs outweighs the risk of major bleeding. What are the limitations of the evidence? We are moderately confident in the evidence for death, major bleeding and minor bleeding. In eight of the studies, the methods used may have affected the results. We are not confident in the evidence for blood clots in people who were given vitamin K antagonist medicine because the evidence came from one study only. This study gave the medicine in a fixed rather than variable dose, which is not current best practice. How up to date is this evidence? This review updates our previous review. The evidence is up to date to June 2021. Editorial note: this is a living systematic review.

abstract = {Abstract - Background Surgical resection for early‐stage non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) offers the best chance of cure, but it is associated with a risk of postoperative pulmonary complications. It is unclear if preoperative exercise training, and the potential resultant improvement in exercise capacity, may improve postoperative outcomes. This review updates our initial 2017 systematic review. Objectives 1. To evaluate the benefits and harm of preoperative exercise training on postoperative outcomes, such as the risk of developing a postoperative pulmonary complication and the postoperative duration of intercostal catheter, in adults scheduled to undergo lung resection for NSCLC. 2. To determine the effect on length of hospital stay (and costs associated with postoperative hospital stay), fatigue, dyspnoea, exercise capacity, lung function and postoperative mortality. Search methods We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was from 28 November 2016 to 23 November 2021. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which study participants who were scheduled to undergo lung resection for NSCLC were allocated to receive either preoperative exercise training or no exercise training. Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were 1. risk of developing a postoperative pulmonary complication; 2. postoperative duration of intercostal catheter and 3. safety. Our secondary outcomes were 1. postoperative length of hospital stay; 2. postintervention fatigue; 3. postintervention dyspnoea; 4. postintervention and postoperative exercise capacity; 5. postintervention lung function and 6. postoperative mortality. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome. Main results Along with the five RCTs included in the original version, we identified an additional five RCTs, resulting in 10 RCTs involving 636 participants. Preoperative exercise training results in a large reduction in the risk of developing a postoperative pulmonary complication compared to no preoperative exercise training (risk ratio (RR) 0.45, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.61; I 2  = 0%; 9 studies, 573 participants; high‐certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about its effect on postoperative intercostal catheter duration (MD −2.07 days, 95% CI −4.64 to 0.49; I 2  = 77%, 3 studies, 111 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Preoperative exercise training is likely safe as studies reported no adverse events. Preoperative exercise training likely results in a reduction in postoperative length of hospital stay (MD −2.24 days, 95% CI −3.64 to −0.85; I 2  = 85%; 9 studies, 573 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Preoperative exercise training likely increases postintervention exercise capacity measured by peak oxygen consumption (MD 3.36 mL/kg/minute, 95% CI 2.70 to 4.02; I 2  = 0%; 2 studies, 191 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence); but the evidence is very uncertain about its effect on postintervention exercise capacity measured by the 6‐minute walk distance (MD 29.55 m, 95% CI 12.05 to 47.04; I 2  = 90%; 6 studies, 474 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Preoperative exercise training may result in little to no effect on postintervention lung function (forced expiratory volume in one second: MD 5.87% predicted, 95% CI 4.46 to 7.28; I 2  = 0%; 4 studies, 197 participants; low‐certainty evidence).  Authors' conclusions Preoperative exercise training results in a large reduction in the risk of developing a postoperative pulmonary complication compared to no preoperative exercise training for people with NSCLC. It may also reduce postoperative length of hospital stay, and improve exercise capacity and lung function in people undergoing lung resection for NSCLC. The findings of this review should be interpreted with caution due to risk of bias. Research investigating the cost‐effectiveness and long‐term outcomes associated with preoperative exercise training in NSCLC is warranted. Plain language summary Exercise training before lung surgery in people with non‐small cell lung cancer Review questions  What is the benefit of exercise undertaken before surgery for lung cancer and how safe is exercise at this time? Background Lung surgery for non‐small cell lung cancer offers people a chance of cure; however, lung surgery is associated with a risk of complications. Exercise training before surgery, through its improvement in fitness, may reduce the risk of lung complications and improve other outcomes, such as number of days people need a chest drain (a plastic tube inserted into the chest to drain off fluid or air that might be collecting after the operation), and length of hospital stay. In the 2017 version of this review, we found that exercise training was associated with a reduced risk of developing lung complications after surgery, shorter time people needed a chest drain, shorter hospital stay, and improved fitness and lung function before surgery. However, the quality of evidence was low. Study characteristics The evidence is current to November 2021. This review included data from 636 people in 10 studies.  Key results Exercise training for people with lung cancer before surgery results in a large reduction (55%) in their risk of developing a lung complication after surgery compared to people who do no exercise before surgery. There were no side effects reported during exercise. Exercise before surgery is likely safe. Preoperative exercise likely reduces length of hospital stay after surgery (by about two days) and increases fitness levels upon completion of the exercise programme. The evidence is very uncertain for its effects on chest drain time. Quality of the evidence The overall quality of evidence ranged from very low to high, mainly because of limitations in the studies' methods, the small number of participants in the included studies and variability in the results.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Most people who are newly diagnosed with non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have advanced disease. For these people, survival is determined by various patient‐ and tumor‐related factors, of which the performance status (PS) is the most important prognostic factor. People with PS 0 or 1 are usually treated with systemic therapies, whereas people with PS 3 or 4 most often receive supportive care. However, treatment for people with PS 2 without a targetable mutation remains unclear. Historically, people with a PS 2 cancer are frequently excluded from (important) clinical trials because of poorer outcomes and increased toxicity. We aim to address this knowledge gap, as this group of people represents a significant proportion (20% to 30%) of the total population with newly diagnosed lung cancer. Objectives To identify the best first‐line therapy for advanced lung cancer in people with performance status 2 without a targetable mutation or with an unknown mutation status. Search methods We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 17 June 2022. Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared different chemotherapy (with or without angiogenesis inhibitor) or immunotherapy regimens, specifically designed for people with PS 2 only or studies including a subgroup of these people. Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were 1. overall survival (OS), 2. health‐related quality of life (HRQoL), and 3. toxicity/adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were 4. tumor response rate, 5. progression‐free survival, and 6. survival rates at six and 12 months' treatment. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence for each outcome. Main results We included 22 trials in this review and identified one ongoing trial. Twenty studies compared chemotherapy with different regimens, of which 11 compared non‐platinum therapy (monotherapy or doublet) versus platinum doublet. We found no studies comparing best supportive care with chemotherapy and only two abstracts analyzing chemotherapy versus immunotherapy. We found that platinum doublet therapy showed superior OS compared to non‐platinum therapy (hazard ratio [HR] 0.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.57 to 0.78; 7 trials, 697 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). There were no differences in six‐month survival rates (risk ratio [RR] 1.00, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.41; 6 trials, 632 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence), whereas 12‐month survival rates were improved for treatment with platinum doublet therapy (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.87 to 0.97; 11 trials, 1567 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). PFS and tumor response rate were also better for people treated with platinum doublet therapy, with moderate‐certainty evidence (PFS: HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.77; 5 trials, 487 participants; tumor response rate: RR 2.25, 95% CI 1.67 to 3.05; 9 trials, 964 participants). When analyzing toxicity rates, we found that platinum doublet therapy increased grade 3 to 5 hematologic toxicities, all with low‐certainty evidence (anemia: RR 1.98, 95% CI 1.00 to 3.92; neutropenia: RR 2.75, 95% CI 1.30 to 5.82; thrombocytopenia: RR 3.96, 95% CI 1.73 to 9.06; all 8 trials, 935 participants). Only four trials reported HRQoL data; however, the methodology was different per trial and we were unable to perform a meta‐analysis. Although evidence is limited, there were no differences in 12‐month survival rates or tumor response rates between carboplatin and cisplatin regimens. With an indirect comparison, carboplatin seemed to have better 12‐month survival rates than cisplatin compared to non‐platinum therapy. The assessment of the efficacy of immunotherapy in people with PS 2 was limited. There might be a place for single‐agent immunotherapy, but the data provided by the included studies did not encourage the use of double‐agent immunotherapy. Authors' conclusions This review showed that as a first‐line treatment for people with PS 2 with advanced NSCLC, platinum doublet therapy seems to be preferred over non‐platinum therapy, with a higher response rate, PFS, and OS. Although the risk for grade 3 to 5 hematologic toxicity is higher, these events are often relatively mild and easy to treat. Since trials using checkpoint inhibitors in people with PS 2 are scarce, we identified an important knowledge gap regarding their role in people with advanced NSCLC and PS 2. Plain language summary Best therapy for people with advanced non‐small cell lung cancer who have not been treated without a targetable mutation and moderately impaired performance status Key messages – The preferred chemotherapy for people with moderately impaired performance status (PS) with advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and that have never received any treatment before should contain two medicines, one of which is a platinum‐based medicine. – Although the risk for bone marrow damage is higher with a platinum‐based medicine, these events are often relatively mild and easy to treat. – We were unable to assess the effects of immunotherapy on moderately impaired people. What is non‐small cell lung cancer? Lung cancer is the most frequent cause of cancer‐related death worldwide and NSCLC is the most common subtype. At the time of diagnosis, the disease has already spread in more than half of all cases. In the tumors of a minority of people diagnosed with NSCLC that has spread to other parts of the body specific mutations can be found, which are treated distinct from the majority of people without such mutations. How can non‐small cell lung cancer be treated? NSCLC can only be treated with life‐prolonging medicines such as chemotherapy (a medicine used to destroy cancer cells) or immunotherapy (a medicine that boosts the person's immune system and helps the body find and destroy cancer cells). Selecting the best treatment depends on the health condition of the person. That condition is determined using a scale from 0 (no symptoms) to 5 (dead). There is no discussion on the treatment of relatively fit people (scoring 0 or 1), as they often tolerate these treatments relatively well. People with a low health condition (scoring 3 or 4) receive only supportive care in most cases. However, although representing 20% to 30% of all people, the best treatment for moderately impaired people (PS 2) is not clear, as they often do not participate in trials. What did we want to find out? Our objective was to investigate the best therapy for people with advanced NSCLC without a specific mutation with PS 2. What did we do? We searched medical databases for clinical trials comparing treatments for advanced NSCLC with best supportive care or other treatments. What did we find? We found 22 trials; 20 compared different types of chemotherapy and two compared chemotherapy versus immunotherapy. Main results People treated with chemotherapy regimens using two medicines, including a platinum‐based medicine, had longer survival than people treated with chemotherapies without a platinum‐based medicine. However, these people did have more side effects, especially with a negative influence on the bone marrow (matter found in the center of bones), resulting in a temporary lack of red and white blood cells, and platelets. The few studies that analyzed health‐related quality of life all used different methods of measurement. We found no difference in quality of life when we looked at those studies individually. We found two partly published trials studying immunotherapy, which found no survival benefit compared to chemotherapy. What are the limitations of the evidence? We are moderately confident in our results that chemotherapies with a platinum‐based medicine increases survival. We are also moderately confident in the evidence evaluating the time to progression of disease because in all included studies, both investigators and trial participants were fully aware of which treatment the participants received. This might lead to substantial bias. In addition, we have little confidence in the evidence regarding toxicities because the evidence is based on a small number of studies with conflicting outcomes. How up to date is this evidence? The evidence is up to date to 17 June 2022.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting the PD‐1/PD‐L1 axis have changed the first‐line treatment of people with advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Single‐agent pembrolizumab (a PD‐1 inhibitor) is currently the standard of care as monotherapy in patients with PD‐L1 expression ≥ 50%, either alone or in combination with chemotherapy when PD‐L1 expression is less than 50%. Atezolizumab (PD‐L1 inhibitor) has also been approved in combination with chemotherapy and bevacizumab (an anti‐angiogenic antibody) in first‐line NSCLC regardless of PD‐L1 expression. The combination of first‐line PD‐1/PD‐L1 inhibitors with anti‐CTLA‐4 antibodies has also been shown to improve survival compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC, particularly in people with high tumour mutational burden (TMB). The association of ipilimumab (an anti CTLA4) and nivolumab (PD‐1 inhibitor) has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in all patients with PD‐L1 expression ≥1%. Although these antibodies are currently used in clinical practice, some questions remain unanswered, such as the best‐treatment strategy, the role of different biomarkers for treatment selection and the effectiveness of immunotherapy according to specific clinical characteristics. Objectives To determine the effectiveness and safety of first‐line immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), as monotherapy or in combination, compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy, with or without bevacizumab for people with advanced NSCLC, according to the level of PD‐L1 expression. Search methods We performed an electronic search of the main databases (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase) from inception until 31 December 2020 and conferences meetings from 2015 onwards. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) reporting on the efficacy or safety of first‐line ICI treatment for adults with advanced NSCLC who had not previously received any anticancer treatment. We included trials comparing single‐ or double‐ICI treatment to standard first‐line therapy (platinum‐based chemotherapy +/‐ bevacizumab). All data come from ‘international multicentre studies involving adults, age 18 or over, with histologically‐confirmed stage IV NSCLC. Data collection and analysis Three review authors independently assessed the search results and a fourth review author resolved any disagreements. Primary outcomes were overall survival (OS) and progression‐free survival (PFS); secondary outcomes were overall objective response rate (ORR) by RECIST v 1.1, grade 3 to 5 treatment‐related adverse events (AEs) (CTCAE v 5.0) and health‐related quality of life (HRQoL). We performed meta‐analyses where appropriate using the random‐effects model for hazard ratios (HRs) or risk ratios (RRs), with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs), and used the I² statistic to investigate heterogeneity. Main results Main results We identified 15 trials for inclusion, seven completed and eight ongoing trials. We obtained data for 5893 participants from seven trials comparing first‐line single‐ (six trials) or double‐ (two trials) agent ICI with platinum‐based chemotherapy, one trial comparing both first‐line single‐ and double‐agent ICsI with platinum‐based chemotherapy. All trials were at low risk of selection and detection bias, some were classified at high risk of performance, attrition or other source of bias. The overall certainty of evidence according to GRADE ranged from moderate‐to‐low because of risk of bias, inconsistency, or imprecision. The majority of the included trials reported their outcomes by PD‐L1 expressions, with PD‐L1 ≥ 50 being considered the most clinically useful cut‐off level for decision makers. Also, iIn order to avoid overlaps between various PDL‐1 expressions we prioritised the review outcomes according to PD‐L1 ≥ 50. Single‐agent ICI  In the PD‐L1 expression ≥ 50% group single‐agent ICI probably improved OS compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy (hazard ratio (HR) 0.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 0.76, 6 RCTs, 2111 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence). In this group, single‐agent ICI also may improve PFS (HR: 0.68, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.88, 5 RCTs, 1886 participants, low‐certainty evidence) and ORR (risk ratio (RR):1.40, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.75, 4 RCTs, 1672 participants, low‐certainty evidence). HRQoL data were available for only one study including only people with PD‐L1 expression ≥ 50%, which suggested that single‐agent ICI may improve HRQoL at 15 weeks compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy (RR: 1.51, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.10, 1 RCT, 297 participants, low‐certainty evidence). In the included studies, treatment‐related AEs were not reported according to PD‐L1 expression levels. Grade 3‐4 AEs may be less frequent with single‐agent ICI compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy (RR: 0.41, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.50, I² = 62%, 5 RCTs, 3346 participants, low‐certainty evidence). More information about efficacy of single‐agent ICI compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy according to the level of PD‐L1 expression and to TMB status or specific clinical characteristics is available in the full text. Double‐agent ICI   Double‐ICI treatment probably prolonged OS compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy in people with PD‐L1 expression ≥50% (HR: 0.72, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.89 2 RCTs, 612 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence). Trials did not report data on HRQoL, PFS and ORR according to PD‐L1 groups. Treatment related AEs were not reported according to PD‐L1 expression levels. The frequency of grade 3‐4 AEs may not differ between double‐ICI treatment and platinum‐based chemotherapy (RR: 0.78, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.09, I² = 81%, 2 RCTs, 1869 participants, low‐certainty evidence). More information about efficacy of double‐agent ICI according to the level of PD‐L1 expression and to TMB status is available in the full text. Authors' conclusions Authors' conclusions The evidence in this review suggests that single‐agent ICI in people with NSCLC and PD‐L1 ≥50% probably leads to a higher overall survival rate and may lead to a higher progression‐free survival and overall response rate when compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy and may also lead to a lower rate of adverse events and higher HRQoL. Combined ICI in people with NSCLC and PD‐L1 ≥50% also probably leads to a higher overall survival rate when compared to platinum‐based chemotherapy, but its effect on progression‐free survival, overall response rate and HRQoL is unknown due to a lack of data. The rate of adverse events may not differ between groups. This review used to be a living review. It is transitioned out of living mode because current research is exploring ICI in association with chemotherapy or other immunotherapeutic drugs versus ICI as single agent rather than platinum based chemotherapy. Plain language summary Immunotherapy versus chemotherapy for people with advanced non‐small cell lung cancer who have not been not previously been treated Review question Is immunotherapy more effective and less toxic than chemotherapy for people diagnosed with non‐small cell lung cancer (a subtype of lung cancer) who have not previously been treated and who are not suitable for curative treatment? Background Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths and non‐small cell lung cancer represent more than 85% of all lung cancer cases. Curative surgery and radiotherapy are not treatment options when the disease is at an advanced stage and until recently these people were offered chemotherapy. Since 2016, immunotherapies (antibodies able to stimulate the immune system against cancer cells) have been shown to improve survival for these patients. Side effects of immunotherapies are mainly inflammation of the tissues caused by the activation of the immune system against different organs, while chemotherapy usually causes a reduction in the white blood cells and red blood cells, hair loss, nausea and vomiting. In this Cochrane Review, we tried to find out how effective and safe immunotherapies (given alone or as combinations) are compared to standard chemotherapy for people with non‐small cell lung cancer who are not suitable for possibly curative treatment. Study characteristics We searched the main databases and records of conference meetings up to 31st December 2020. We included seven studies (5893 participants) comparing immunotherapies (antibodies that interact with specific proteins called immune checkpoints) with chemotherapy for people with non‐small cell lung cancer not previously treated. Key results We reported the results by PD‐L1 levels (a protein produced by the tumour or immune cells and bound by immune checkpoint inhibitors) In people with more than 50% of tumour/immune cells expressing PD‐L1 protein, single immunotherapy might improve survival with fewer side effects. In addition, treatment with combined immunotherapies may improve survival in both people with high expression of PD‐L1 protein.The rate of toxic effects may be the same for people treated with combined immunotherapies or chemotherapy. Certainty of evidence Overall, the certainty of the evidence ranged from moderate to low. Conclusions For people with advanced non‐small cell lung cancer with a high expression of PD‐L1 protein, immunotherapies alone or combinations of immunotherapies prolonged life compared to chemotherapy. The frequency of side effects may be lower with the use of immunotherapies alone compared to chemotherapy. The frequency of side effects may not differ between combinations of immunotherapies and chemotherapy.  },

abstract = {Abstract - Background Malignant pleural mesothelioma is an almost always fatal tumour, for which palliative platinum‐based chemotherapy is currently the standard treatment. Multimodal therapeutic strategies incorporating surgery, radiation therapy or photodynamic therapy and chemotherapy have been recommended for selected patients but there is no consensus about their effectiveness. Objectives To assess the benefits and harms of radical multimodal treatment options (including radical surgery ± radical radiotherapy ± photodynamic therapy ± systemic therapy) compared to each other or to palliative treatments, for people with malignant pleural mesothelioma. Search methods We reviewed data from the Cochrane Lung Cancer group's Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and Embase. We also checked reference lists of primary original studies, review articles and relevant conference proceedings manually for further related articles up to 21 March 2017. Selection criteria We included parallel‐group randomised controlled trials of multimodal therapy for people with malignant pleural mesothelioma (stages I, II or III) that measured at least one of the following endpoints: overall survival, health‐related health‐related quality of life, adverse events or progression‐free survival. We considered studies regardless of language or publication status. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted relevant information on participant characteristics, interventions, study outcomes, and data on the outcomes for this review, as well as information on the design and methodology of the studies. Two review authors assessed the risk of bias in the included trials using pre‐defined 'Risk of bias' domains. We assessed the methodological quality using GRADE. Main results We conducted this review in accordance with the published Cochrane protocol. Two randomised clinical trials with 104 participants fulfilled our inclusion criteria. Both trials were at high risk of bias (for outcomes other than overall survival), and we rated the evidence as moderate quality for overall survival and low quality for all other outcomes. One trial compared combined extrapleural pneumonectomy (EPP) plus neoadjuvant platinum‐based chemotherapy plus postoperative high‐dose hemithoracic radiotherapy with combined EPP plus platinum‐based chemotherapy. The other trial compared EPP plus postoperative hemithoracic radiotherapy with standard (non‐radical) therapy alone following platinum‐based chemotherapy (patients in the standard therapy arm received continued oncological management according to local policy, which could include further chemotherapy or palliative radiotherapy). For the first trial, median overall survival calculated from registration was 20.8 months (95% confidence interval (CI) 14.4 to 27.8) in the no‐radiotherapy group and 19.3 months (95% CI 11.5 to 21.8) in the radiotherapy group. For the second trial, median overall survival was 14.4 months (95% CI 5.3 to 18.7) for patients allocated to EPP and 19.5 months (95% CI 13.4 to time not yet reached) for patients randomised to standard non‐radical therapy. In the second trial, 12 serious adverse events were reported during the study period: ten in the EPP group and two in the non‐radical therapy group. Overall health‐related quality of life scores were not different between the two arms in either study. We could not perform a meta‐analysis of the two included trials due to clinical heterogeneity. We also identified three ongoing trials evaluating the topic of our review. Authors' conclusions The overall strength of the evidence gathered in this review is low and there is a lack of available evidence to support the use of radical multimodality therapy in routine clinical practice (particularly as one trial suggests greater harm). Given the added cost of multimodality treatment and the possible increase in risk of adverse effects, the lack of evidence of their effectiveness probably means that these interventions should currently be limited to clinical trials alone. Plain language summary Multimodality treatment for malignant pleural mesothelioma (primary pleural cancer) Review question Does radical surgery with or without radiotherapy improve the length and health‐related quality of life in people with localised malignant mesothelioma, compared with chemotherapy and supportive care only? Background Malignant pleural mesothelioma (that is, primary pleural cancer) is a difficult tumour to treat. Chemotherapy is usually given first to people who are fit enough to have it. It is not clear whether radical surgery and radiotherapy help people to live longer or improve their overall health‐related quality of life. Study characteristics We searched published medical articles to find research papers that looked at combined treatment strategies with surgery for treating people with primary pleural cancer. We looked for randomised clinical trials (where people were allocated at random to one of two or more treatments groups) and used information from those we found to form our conclusions. We found evidence up to 21 March 2017. Key results The review authors found two small randomised clinical trials, in which a total of 104 people with pleural mesothelioma were randomised. One trial compared the addition of surgery and radiotherapy to chemotherapy with chemotherapy alone. The other trial compared the addition of radiotherapy to chemotherapy and surgery with chemotherapy and surgery alone. These two small trials suggested that there is no added value for either radiotherapy or combined radiotherapy and surgery. We could not combine the data from the trials as we had intended, because the two trials were too different. We rated the quality of evidence as moderate for survival and low quality for all the other outcomes studied. The review authors identified three ongoing randomised clinical trials, the results of which have not been published yet. Quality of evidence and conclusions We only found two relevant trials. Both were small, which made the results uncertain. It is not clear whether giving a combination of surgery and radical radiotherapy after chemotherapy is better than giving chemotherapy alone. Radical radiotherapy does not seem to improve the results of surgery alone.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Radiation therapy (RT) is given to about half of all people with cancer. RT alone is used to treat various cancers at different stages. Although it is a local treatment, systemic symptoms may occur. Cancer‐ or treatment‐related side effects can lead to a reduction in physical activity, physical performance, and quality of life (QoL). The literature suggests that physical exercise can reduce the risk of various side effects of cancer and cancer treatments, cancer‐specific mortality, recurrence of cancer, and all‐cause mortality. Objectives To evaluate the benefits and harms of exercise plus standard care compared with standard care alone in adults with cancer receiving RT alone. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), CINAHL, conference proceedings and trial registries up to 26 October 2022. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that enrolled people who were receiving RT without adjuvant systemic treatment for any type or stage of cancer. We considered any type of exercise intervention, defined as a planned, structured, repetitive, objective‐oriented physical activity programme in addition to standard care. We excluded exercise interventions that involved physiotherapy alone, relaxation programmes, and multimodal approaches that combined exercise with other non‐standard interventions such as nutritional restriction. Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane methodology and the GRADE approach for assessing the certainty of the evidence. Our primary outcome was fatigue and the secondary outcomes were QoL, physical performance, psychosocial effects, overall survival, return to work, anthropometric measurements, and adverse events. Main results Database searching identified 5875 records, of which 430 were duplicates. We excluded 5324 records and the remaining 121 references were assessed for eligibility. We included three two‐arm RCTs with 130 participants. Cancer types were breast and prostate cancer. Both treatment groups received the same standard care, but the exercise groups also participated in supervised exercise programmes several times per week while undergoing RT. Exercise interventions included warm‐up, treadmill walking (in addition to cycling and stretching and strengthening exercises in one study), and cool‐down. In some analysed endpoints (fatigue, physical performance, QoL), there were baseline differences between exercise and control groups. We were unable to pool the results of the different studies owing to substantial clinical heterogeneity. All three studies measured fatigue. Our analyses, presented below, showed that exercise may reduce fatigue (positive SMD values signify less fatigue; low certainty). • Standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.27 to 1.64; 37 participants (fatigue measured with Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI)) • SMD 2.42, 95% CI 1.71 to 3.13; 54 participants (fatigue measured with BFI) • SMD 1.44, 95% CI 0.46 to 2.42; 21 participants (fatigue measured with revised Piper Fatigue Scale) All three studies measured QoL, although one provided insufficient data for analysis. Our analyses, presented below, showed that exercise may have little or no effect on QoL (positive SMD values signify better QoL; low certainty). • SMD 0.40, 95% CI −0.26 to 1.05; 37 participants (QoL measured with Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy‐Prostate) • SMD 0.47, 95% CI −0.40 to 1.34; 21 participants (QoL measured with World Health Organization QoL questionnaire (WHOQOL‐BREF)) All three studies measured physical performance. Our analyses of two studies, presented below, showed that exercise may improve physical performance, but we are very unsure about the results (positive SMD values signify better physical performance; very low certainty) • SMD 1.25, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.97; 37 participants (shoulder mobility and pain measured on a visual analogue scale) • SMD⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠ 3.13 (95% CI 2.32 to 3.95; 54 participants (physical performance measured with the six‐minute walk test) Our analyses of data from the third study showed that exercise may have little or no effect on physical performance measured with the stand‐and‐sit test, but we are very unsure about the results (SMD 0.00, 95% CI −0.86 to 0.86, positive SMD values signify better physical performance; 21 participants; very low certainty). Two studies measured psychosocial effects. Our analyses (presented below) showed that exercise may have little or no effect on psychosocial effects, but we are very unsure about the results (positive SMD values signify better psychosocial well‐being; very low certainty). • SMD 0.48, 95% CI −0.18 to 1.13; 37 participants (psychosocial effects measured on the WHOQOL‐BREF social subscale) • SMD 0.29, 95% CI −0.57 to 1.15; 21 participants (psychosocial effects measured with the Beck Depression Inventory) Two studies recorded adverse events related to the exercise programmes and reported no events. We estimated the certainty of the evidence as very low. No studies reported adverse events unrelated to exercise. No studies reported the other outcomes we intended to analyse (overall survival, anthropometric measurements, return to work). Authors' conclusions There is little evidence on the effects of exercise interventions in people with cancer who are receiving RT alone. While all included studies reported benefits for the exercise intervention groups in all assessed outcomes, our analyses did not consistently support this evidence. There was low‐certainty evidence that exercise improved fatigue in all three studies. Regarding physical performance, our analysis showed very low‐certainty evidence of a difference favouring exercise in two studies, and very low‐certainty evidence of no difference in one study. We found very low‐certainty evidence of little or no difference between the effects of exercise and no exercise on quality of life or psychosocial effects. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence for possible outcome reporting bias, imprecision due to small sample sizes in a small number of studies, and indirectness of outcomes. In summary, exercise may have some beneficial outcomes in people with cancer who are receiving RT alone, but the evidence supporting this statement is of low certainty. There is a need for high‐quality research on this topic. Plain language summary Exercise interventions for adults with cancer who are receiving radiation therapy without additional cancer therapy What is radiation therapy? Radiation therapy (also called radiotherapy) is a treatment that delivers high doses of radiation to a specific part of the body to kill cancer cells. One in two people with cancer will undergo radiation therapy. Some people receive radiation therapy alone, while others receive radiation therapy combined with other cancer treatments that affect the whole body (chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or hormone therapy). The unwanted effects of radiation therapy usually affect the part of the body where the radiation is delivered, but there may also be symptoms that affect the whole body. These unwanted effects can lead to reduced physical activity, physical performance, and quality of life. There is evidence that people with cancer who perform exercise may be less likely to die from cancer or from other causes, may be less likely to have their cancer return, and may have fewer unwanted effects of cancer treatment.  What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out if exercise could help to improve the following outcomes in people with cancer receiving radiation therapy alone. • Fatigue • Quality of life • Physical performance • Psychosocial effects (such as depression) • Overall survival • Return to work • Anthropometric measurements (such as weight) • Unwanted effects What did we do? We searched electronic medical literature databases for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that enrolled people with all types and stages of cancer who were receiving RT alone. Eligible RCTs randomly assigned some participants to receive any type of exercise intervention plus standard care and others to standard care alone. We excluded exercise interventions that involved physiotherapy alone, relaxation programmes, or combination programmes with exercise and, for example, dietary restrictions. We compared the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. What did we find? We included three studies that enrolled 130 people with breast or prostate cancer. The exercise groups participated in a supervised exercise programme three to five times per week for five to eight weeks. The exercise interventions included warm‐up, aerobic exercise, and cool‐down. We analysed the differences between the exercise groups and control groups in the outcome values after radiation therapy. We could not compare the differences between the groups in the change in outcome values from before to after radiotherapy because the studies did not provide enough information for this comparison. In some outcomes (fatigue, physical performance, quality of life), there were already differences between the exercise and control groups at the beginning of the studies. Exercise may improve fatigue and may have little or no effect on quality of life. Exercise may improve physical performance, but we are very uncertain about the results. Exercise may have little or no effect on psychosocial effects, but we are very uncertain about the results. Two studies reported no unwanted effects of exercise. No studies measured our other outcomes of interest.  Exercise programmes in people with cancer receiving RT alone may provide some benefits, but the evidence to support this is poor. Due to the lack of evidence, we could not detect and also not rule out clear differences in outcomes. What are the limitations of the evidence? We have little or very little confidence in the evidence because the results are based on a small number of studies that enrolled very few people, because the people in two studies knew which group they were in, and because the evidence focused on a specific population whereas the question we wanted to answer was broader. Further research is likely to change our results. How up to date is the evidence? The evidence is up to date to 26 October 2022. },

abstract = {Abstract - Background Targeted therapies directed at specific driver oncogenes have improved outcomes for individuals with advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Approximately 5% of lung adenocarcinomas, the most common histologic subtype of NSCLC, harbour rearrangements in the anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ) gene leading to constitutive activity of the ALK kinase. Crizotinib was the first tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) demonstrated to be effective in advanced NSCLC. Next‐generation ALK TKIs have since been developed including ceritinib, alectinib, brigatinib, ensartinib, and lorlatinib, and have been compared with crizotinib or chemotherapy in randomised controlled trials (RCTs). These  ALK ‐targeted therapies are currently used in clinical practice and are endorsed in multiple clinical oncology guidelines. Objectives To evaluate the safety and efficacy of ALK inhibitors given as monotherapy to treat advanced  ALK ‐rearranged NSCLC. Search methods We conducted electronic searches in the Cochrane Lung Cancer Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, and Embase. We also searched conference proceedings from the American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO), European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO), and International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) World Conference on Lung Cancer, as well as the reference lists of retrieved articles. All searches were conducted from 2007 until 7 January 2021. Selection criteria We included RCTs comparing ALK inhibitors with cytotoxic chemotherapy or another ALK inhibitor in individuals with incurable locally advanced or metastatic pathologically confirmed  ALK ‐rearranged NSCLC. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed studies for eligibility, extracted study characteristics and outcome data, and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool for each included study. We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. Primary outcomes were progression‐free survival (PFS) and adverse events (AE); secondary outcomes were overall survival (OS), OS at one year, overall response rate (ORR) by RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours) criteria, and health‐related quality of life (HRQoL). We performed a meta‐analysis for all outcomes, where appropriate, using the fixed‐effect model. We reported hazard ratios (HR) for PFS, OS, and a composite HRQoL of life outcome (time to deterioration), and risk ratios (RR) for AE, ORR, and one‐year OS. We presented 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) and used the I² statistic to investigate heterogeneity. We planned comparisons of 'ALK inhibitor versus chemotherapy' and 'next‐generation ALK inhibitor versus crizotinib’ with subgroup analysis by type of ALK inhibitor, line of treatment, and baseline central nervous system involvement. Main results Eleven studies (2874 participants) met our inclusion criteria: six studies compared an ALK inhibitor (crizotinib, ceritinib, and alectinib) to chemotherapy, and five studies compared a next‐generation ALK inhibitor (alectinib, brigatinib, and lorlatinib) to crizotinib. We assessed the evidence for most outcomes as of moderate to high certainty. Most studies were at low risk for selection, attrition, and reporting bias; however, no RCTs were blinded, resulting in a high risk of performance and detection bias for outcomes reliant on subjective measurement. ALK inhibitor versus chemotherapy Treatment with ALK inhibitors resulted in a large increase in PFS compared to chemotherapy (HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.52, 6 RCTs, 1611 participants, high‐certainty evidence). This was found regardless of line of treatment. ALK inhibitors may result in no difference in overall AE rate when compared to chemotherapy (RR 1.01, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.03, 5 RCTs, 1404 participants, low‐certainty evidence). ALK inhibitors slightly improved OS (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.97, 6 RCTs, 1611 participants, high‐certainty evidence), despite most included studies having a significant number of participants crossing over from chemotherapy to receive an ALK inhibitor after the study period. ALK inhibitors likely increase ORR (RR 2.43, 95% CI 2.16 to 2.75, 6 RCTs, 1611 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence) including in measurable baseline brain metastases (RR 4.88, 95% CI 2.18 to 10.95, 3 RCTs, 108 participants) when compared to chemotherapy. ALK inhibitors result in a large increase in the HRQoL measure, time to deterioration (HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.60, 5 RCTs, 1504 participants, high‐certainty evidence) when compared to chemotherapy. Next‐generation ALK inhibitor versus crizotinib Next‐generation ALK inhibitors resulted in a large increase in PFS (HR 0.39, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.46, 5 RCTs, 1263 participants, high‐certainty evidence), particularly in participants with baseline brain metastases. Next‐generation ALK inhibitors likely result in no difference in overall AE (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.01, 5 RCTs, 1263 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence) when compared to crizotinib. Next‐generation ALK inhibitors likely increase OS (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.90, 5 RCTs, 1263 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence) and slightly increase ORR (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.25, 5 RCTs, 1229 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence) including a response in measurable brain metastases (RR 2.45, 95% CI 1.7 to 3.54, 4 RCTs, 138 participants) when compared to crizotinib. Studies comparing ALK inhibitors were conducted exclusively or partly in the first‐line setting. Authors' conclusions Next‐generation ALK inhibitors including alectinib, brigatinib, and lorlatinib are the preferred first systemic treatment for individuals with advanced  ALK ‐rearranged NSCLC. Further trials are ongoing including investigation of first‐line ensartinib. Next‐generation inhibitors have not been compared to each other, and it is unknown which should be used first and what subsequent treatment sequence is optimal. Plain language summary Targeted treatment of non‐small cell lung cancer with an anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ) gene mutation Background The most common type of lung cancer is non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). About 5% of NSCLC will be driven by a gene mutation known as anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ). Targeted treatments for those with advanced (not curable)  ALK‐ mutated NSCLC cancer have been developed and found to be more effective than chemotherapy. The first ALK inhibitor to be developed was crizotinib. Newer  ALK ‐targeted drugs have also been developed and include ceritinib, alectinib, brigatinib, ensartinib, and lorlatinib. In this review we looked at treatments that target  ALK‐ mutated NSCLC to find out how well they work. Objectives  The primary objective of this review was to find out whether people with  ALK‐ mutated NSCLC given treatments targeted towards ALK live longer without recurrence and have fewer side effects than those treated with chemotherapy. We also planned to evaluate whether newer  ALK ‐targeted drugs achieve this better than crizotinib.  Study characteristics We searched the main medical databases and records of conferences up to 7 January 2021. We found 11 studies (2874 participants): six studies compared an  ALK ‐targeted drug to chemotherapy, and five studies compared a newer  ALK ‐targeted drug to crizotinib. The studies were conducted in people with advanced  ALK‐ mutated NSCLC using these drugs as their first or later treatment. A total of five different ALK inhibitors were used across studies: alectinib, brigatinib, ceritinib, crizotinib, and lorlatinib. Results People treated with  ALK ‐targeted drugs lived longer without their cancer growing than those on chemotherapy. These improvements were also seen in people with cancer that had spread to the brain. People receiving  ALK ‐targeted drugs lived longer overall, even when some had received chemotherapy first.  ALK ‐targeted drugs cause a similar number of side effects as chemotherapy.  ALK ‐targeted drugs caused more tumours to reduce in size and resulted in a longer time until worsening of symptoms when compared to chemotherapy.  People treated with newer  ALK ‐targeted drugs lived longer without their cancer growing than those receiving crizotinib, including in people with cancer involving the brain. People treated with newer  ALK ‐targeted drugs as first treatment were likely to live longer overall with a similar number of overall side effects. Newer  ALK ‐targeted drugs caused more tumours to reduce in size when compared to crizotinib. The evidence for most reported measures was of moderate or high certainty. Conclusions The best first treatment for people with incurable  ALK‐ mutated lung cancer is a newer ALK inhibitor such as alectinib, brigatinib, ceritinib, or lorlatinib. More studies are needed to determine which of these options is best and what treatment should be used when the cancer grows after these medicines have been given.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Primary cutaneous T‐cell lymphomas (CTCL) belong to the group of non‐Hodgkin lymphomas and usually run an indolent course. However, some patients progress to advanced tumour or leukaemic stages. To date, there is no cure for those cases. In the last few years, several publications reported durable responses in some patients following allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT). This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2011 and updated in 2013. Objectives To compare the efficacy and safety of conventional therapies with allogeneic stem cell transplantation in patients with advanced primary cutaneous T‐cell lymphomas. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1950 to January 2013), Internet‐databases of ongoing trials, conference proceedings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO, 2009 to July 2013) and the American Society of Hematology (ASH, 2009 to July 2013). We also contacted members of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Cutaneous Lymphoma Task Force to check for ongoing study activities. We handsearched citations from identified trials and relevant review articles. In addition, we handsearched randomised controlled trials from the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) and International Conference on Cutaneous T‐cell Lymphoma, ASCO and ASH up to July 2013. Selection criteria Trials eligible for inclusion were genetically randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing alloSCT plus conditioning therapy (regardless of agents) with conventional therapy as treatment for advanced CTCL. Data collection and analysis Two review authors would have extracted data from eligible studies and assessed their quality. The primary outcome measure was overall survival; secondary outcomes were time to progression, response rate, treatment‐related mortality, adverse events and quality of life. Main results We did not identify any randomised controlled trials from the updated search in January 2013. In 2011, we found 2077 citations but none were relevant genetically or non‐genetically randomised controlled trials. All 41 studies that were thought to be potentially suitable were excluded after full text screening for being non‐randomised, not including CTCL or being review articles. Authors' conclusions We planned to report evidence from genetically or non‐genetically randomised controlled trials comparing conventional therapy and allogeneic stem cell transplantation. However, we did not identify any randomised controlled trials addressing this question. Nevertheless, prospective genetically randomised controlled trials need to be initiated to evaluate the precise role of alloSCT in advanced CTCL. Plain language summary The role of allogeneic stem cell transplantation for patients with advanced stage primary cutaneous T‐cell lymphoma Primary cutaneous T‐cell lymphomas (CTCLs) are a subgroup of blood cancers called non‐Hodgkin lymphomas. CTCL is usually seen first in the skin. It is characterised by an uncontrolled increase in T‐lymphocytes, which are a special kind of white blood cell. Most people who get the disease are older than 60 years of age. Compared to other T‐lymphocyte diseases, this type usually progresses slowly. The likely course and outcome of the disease is also better for this type of cancer. However, there is still no cure yet. The most common subtype of CTCL is Mycosis fungoides (MF) which typically grows slowly in the early stages. However, approximately 20% of people in early‐stage of the disease will get worse and progress to tumour stage or develop a type of leukaemia called Sézary syndrome. Most of these people are then subjected to chemotherapies to kill off the cancer cells. The chemotherapy may involve one or more drugs (known as monochemotherapy or polychemotherapies). Although some patients respond well at the beginning of treatment, the disease often returns and life expectancy is uncertain. Furthermore, many patients can experience severe side effects from the treatment. In the last few years, several publications have reported durable responses following a procedure called allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT). This is when the patient receives a transplant of stem cells from another donor. Before the transplant begins, the patient undergoes treatment to reduce the size of the tumour. This is called full‐intensity or reduced‐intensity conditioning (RIC). Reduced‐intensity conditioning allows the patient to avoid the standard regimes of high‐dose therapy. It appears to be equally effective but with significantly less toxicity. The use of reduced‐intensity conditioning means that older people, who are the majority of patients with this disease, can be treated with stem cells. We planned to carry out a review of the effect of allogeneic stem cell transplantation compared to standard therapy in patients with cutaneous T‐cell lymphomas. However, after thorough searches, we did not find any relevant studies. Instead we have only been able to give a summary of some case series and clinical evaluations. These do not allow us to clearly assess the possibilities and limitations of this treatment. Nevertheless, they do show that allogeneic stem cell transplantation may be of some benefit, with acceptable side effects. Therefore, it can be considered as a promising treatment option for patients with advanced CTCL but more research is needed.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Purified thymus extracts (pTE) and synthetic thymic peptides (sTP) are thought to enhance the immune system of cancer patients in order to fight the growth of tumour cells and to resist infections due to immunosuppression induced by the disease and antineoplastic therapy. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of pTE and sTP for the management of cancer. Search methods We searched CENTRAL ( The Cochrane Library  2010, Issue 3), MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, BIOETHICSLINE, BIOSIS, CATLINE, CISCOM, HEALTHSTAR, HTA, SOMED and LILACS (to February 2010). Selection criteria Randomised trials of pTE or sTP in addition to chemotherapy or radiotherapy, or both, compared to the same regimen with placebo or no additional treatment in adult cancer patients. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently extracted data from published trials. We derived odds ratios (OR) from overall survival (OS) and disease‐free survival (DFS) rates, tumour response (TR) rates, and rates of adverse effects (AE) related to antineoplastic treatments. We used a random‐effects model for meta‐analysis. Main results We identified 26 trials (2736 patients). Twenty trials investigated pTE (thymostimulin or thymosin fraction 5) and six trials investigated sTP (thymopentin or thymosin α 1 ). Twenty‐one trials reported results for OS, six for DFS, 14 for TR, nine for AE and 10  for safety of pTE and sTP. Addition of pTE conferred no benefit on OS (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.25); DFS (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.16); or TR (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.25). Heterogeneity was moderate to high for all these outcomes. For thymosin α 1  the pooled RR for OS was 1.21 (95% CI 0.94 to 1.56, P = 0.14), with low heterogeneity; and 3.37 (95% CI 0.66 to 17.30, P = 0.15) for DFS, with moderate heterogeneity. The pTE reduced the risk of severe infectious complications (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.78, P = 0.0008; I² = 0%). The RR for severe neutropenia in patients treated with thymostimulin was 0.55 (95% CI 0.25 to 1.23,  P = 0.15). Tolerability of pTE and sTP was good. Most of the trials had at least a moderate risk of bias. Authors' conclusions Overall, we found neither evidence that the addition of pTE to antineoplastic treatment reduced the risk of death or disease progression nor that it improved the rate of tumour responses to antineoplastic treatment. For thymosin α 1 , there was a trend for a reduced risk of dying and of improved DFS. There was preliminary evidence that pTE lowered the risk of severe infectious complications in patients undergoing chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Plain language summary Thymic peptides for treatment of cancer patients in addition to chemotherapy or radiotherapy, or both The immune system plays a key role in the body’s own defences against cancer cells. The thymus gland plays a central part in this and modifies T‐cells, a subset of lymphocytes. Studies with thymic peptides have shown a variety of effects on the immune system. There are two groups of thymic peptides available for use in treatment: purified extracts from animal (mostly calf) thymus glands and synthetically produced thymus gland peptides.  This review aims to answer the question whether having thymic peptides can improve the response to and tolerability of standard chemotherapy or radiotherapy, or combined treatment. Further questions are whether the peptides inhibit or reduce the progression and recurrence of disease, whether they prolong the life of cancer patients and whether quality of life is improved. This review looked at the evidence from 26 clinical trials with a total of 2736 adult cancer patients. Many of the trials were small and of moderate quality. Only three studies were less than 10 years old. Thymosin α 1  is a synthetic peptide that shows some promise as a treatment option for patients with metastatic melanoma when used in addition to chemotherapy. Severe problems occur during chemotherapy and radiotherapy due to low white blood cell counts and infections. These were reduced by using purified thymus extracts. However, the use of purified thymus extracts should be investigated more thoroughly before the extracts are used routinely in patients. The findings were not conclusive and caution is advised. Overall, thymic peptides seem to be well tolerated.},

There was no language restriction in searching for studies. Selection criteria We planned to include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of  trials using chemotherapy (either single‐agent or combination chemotherapy plus surgery, radiotherapy or not) for thymic carcinoma and/or advanced thymoma. We planned to include all adults (aged 18 years and over) diagnosed with thymic carcinoma and/or with Masaoka stage III or IV thymic tumours. The intended primary outcomes were overall survival (OS) and progression‐free survival (PFS). Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently evaluated the search results according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. There were no studies identified for inclusion and therefore no data extraction was completed. Main results No RCTs were eligible for inclusion in this review. We report details of excluded prospective studies in an additional table and try to provide some useful evidence regarding current practice. Authors' conclusions There were no RCTs eligible for inclusion in this review. In current practice the most common regimen for adult patients with thymic carcinoma or advanced thymoma is cisplatin‐based chemotherapy. Considering the condition is rare, it is suggested that an international group is set up to organise and evaluate prospective collection of data from cohorts of patients to inform current clinical practice. Plain language summary Chemotherapy (drug treatment) for inoperable thymic cancer in adults Question : Which type and when should chemotherapy (drug treatment) be given to people with thymic carcinoma or advanced thymoma? Background : Thymic cancers are rare tumours arising in the thymus gland behind the breastbone in the chest cavity. For people with advanced‐stage thymic tumours complete surgical resection is normally not possible and the only treatment option is combined chemotherapy. This review aimed to assess the role of chemotherapy in people with advanced thymic tumours. Main findings : We did not identify any suitable clinical trials for inclusion in this review from our search (up to July 2012). We have reported details of prospective studies that are not suitable for inclusion in the review, which provide some useful evidence about current clinical practice. Quality of the evidence : While various treatment options are used, cisplatin‐based chemotherapy is currently the usual regimen of choice, however this is not supported by good‐quality trials.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Liver metastases (i.e. secondary hepatic malignancies) are significantly more common than primary liver cancer. Long‐term survival after radical surgical treatment is approximately 50%. For people in whom resection for cure is not feasible, other treatments must be considered. One treatment option is microwave coagulation utilising electromagnetic waves. It involves placing an electrode into a lesion under ultrasound or computed tomography guidance. Objectives To evaluate the beneficial and harmful effects of microwave coagulation versus no intervention, other ablation methods, or systemic treatments in people with liver metastases regardless of the location of the primary tumour. Search methods We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest date of search was 14 April 2023. Selection criteria Randomised clinical trials assessing beneficial or harmful effects of microwave coagulation and its comparators in people with liver metastases, irrespective of the location of the primary tumour. We included trials no matter the outcomes reported. Data collection and analysis We followed standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Our primary outcomes were: all‐cause mortality at the last follow‐up and time to mortality; health‐related quality of life (HRQoL); and any adverse events or complications. Our secondary outcomes were: cancer mortality; disease‐free survival; failure to clear liver metastases; recurrence of liver metastases; time to progression of liver metastases; and tumour response measures. We used risk ratios (RR) and hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) to present the results. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane RoB 1 tool. We used GRADE methodology to assess the certainty of the evidence. Main results Three randomised clinical trials fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The control interventions differed in the three trials; therefore, meta‐analyses were not possible. The trials were at high risk of bias. The certainty of evidence of the assessed outcomes in the three comparisons was very low. Data on our prespecified outcomes were either missing or not reported. Microwave coagulation plus conventional transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) versus conventional TACE alone One trial, conducted in China, randomised 50 participants (mean age 60 years, 76% males) with liver metastases from various primary sites. Authors reported that the follow‐up period was at least one month. The trial reported adverse events or complications in the experimental group only and for tumour response measures. There were no dropouts in the trial. The trial did not report on any other outcomes. Microwave ablation versus conventional surgery One trial, conducted in Japan, randomised 40 participants (mean age 61 years, 53% males) with multiple liver metastases of colorectal cancer. Ten participants were excluded after randomisation (six from the experimental and four from the control group); thus, the trial analyses included 30 participants. Follow‐up was three years. The reported number of deaths from all causes was 9/14 included participants in the microwave group versus 12/16 included participants in the conventional surgery group. The mean overall survival was 27 months in the microwave ablation and 25 months in the conventional surgery group. The three‐year overall survival was 14% with microwave ablation and 23% with conventional surgery, resulting in an HR of 0.91 (95% CI 0.39 to 2.15). The reported frequency of adverse events or complications was comparable between the two groups, except for the required blood transfusion, which was more common in the conventional surgery group. There was no intervention‐related mortality. Disease‐free survival was 11.3 months in the microwave ablationgroup and 13.3 months in the conventional surgery group. The trial did not report on HRQoL. Microwave ablation versus radiofrequency ablation One trial, conducted in Germany, randomised 50 participants (mean age 62.8 years, 46% males) who were followed for 24 months. Two‐year mortality showed an RR of 0.62 (95% CI 0.26 to 1.47). The trial reported that, by two years, 76.9% of participants in the microwave ablationgroup and 62.5% of participants in the radiofrequency ablation group survived (HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.73). The trial reported no deaths or major complications during the procedures in either group. There were two minor complications only in the radiofrequency ablation group (RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.01 to 3.67). The trial reported technical efficacy in 100% of procedures in both groups. Distant recurrence was reported for 10 participants in the microwave ablation group and nine participants in the radiofrequency ablation group (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.50 to 2.08). No participant in the microwave ablation group demonstrated local progression at 12 months, while that occurred in two participants in the radiofrequency ablation group (RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.01 to 3.67). The trial did not report on HRQoL. One trial reported partial support by Medicor (MMS Medicor Medical Supplies GmbH, Kerpen, Germany) for statistical analysis. The remaining two trials did not provide information on funding. We identified four ongoing trials. Authors' conclusions The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of microwave ablation in addition to conventional TACE compared with conventional TACE alone on adverse events or complications. We do not know if microwave ablation compared with conventional surgery may have little to no effect on all‐cause mortality. We do not know the effect of microwave ablation compared with radiofrequency ablation on all‐cause mortality and adverse events or complications either. Data on all‐cause mortality and time to mortality, HRQoL, adverse events or complications, cancer mortality, disease‐free survival, failure to clear liver metastases, recurrence of liver metastases, time to progression of liver metastases, and tumour response measures were either insufficient or were lacking. In light of the current inconclusive evidence and the substantial gaps in data, the pursuit of additional good‐quality, large randomised clinical trials is not only justified but also essential to elucidate the efficacy and comparative benefits of microwave ablation in relation to various interventions for liver metastases. The current version of the review, in comparison to the previous one, incorporates two new trials in two additional microwave ablation comparisons: 1. in addition to conventional TACE versus conventional TACE alone and 2. versus radiofrequency ablation. Plain language summary Microwave coagulation for liver metastases Key messages – We do not know whether microwave coagulation, added to another method of destroying cancer cells given directly to the liver (conventional transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE)), as compared with TACE alone, has benefit in terms of side effects or complications. – We do not know whether microwave coagulation compared with conventional surgery or another method of destroying cancer cells (radiofrequency ablation) has benefit in terms of death, longer life, and side effects or complications. What are liver metastases and microwave coagulation? Liver metastases are new cancer sites that spread to other parts of the body. They commonly originate from cancers of the lung, stomach, colon (large intestine), rectum, and endometrium (lining of the womb). There are different ways to treat liver metastases in people in whom resection (surgical removal of the cancer) for cure is not feasible. One method, microwave ablation, requires placing a special electrode near the cancer site, which destroys surrounding cancer cells using electromagnetic waves. What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out if microwave ablation provides benefit over no intervention, other methods of destroying cancer cells given directly to the liver, or other types of treatments working throughout the whole body, when applied to people with liver metastases, regardless of the location of the primary cancer. We looked at the likelihood of death, how long people lived, whether it was possible to eliminate metastases, how often tumours returned, whether disease worsened, the quality of life in terms of health changes, and whether any side effects occurred. What did we do? We searched medical databases for randomised trials comparing microwave ablation with no intervention or other types of treatment of liver metastases. In a randomised trial, participants are allocated at random to the study treatments. What did we find? We found three trials, all conducted in upper‐middle and high‐income countries. One study in China allocated 50 people to microwave ablation plus conventional TACE versus conventional TACE alone. In conventional TACE, a mixture of a drug toxic for cancer cells and a substance blocking blood vessels is injected directly to the artery feeding the tumour to destroy and close it. The study was very uncertain about the effect of microwave ablation plus conventional TACE on decreasing the size of the tumour. It reported side effects in the microwave ablation group only, such as fever, mild stomach pain, signs of mild liver inflammation or damaged, and mild fluid accumulation in the abdomen. Authors did not report how many people died, whether quality of life improved after treatment, whether people lived longer, whether metastases were eliminated, and whether cancer returned. One study in Japan allocated 40 people to microwave ablation versus conventional surgery. The trial reported that the proportion of people surviving three years later was similar in both groups. People lived for similar periods of time (about 27 months with microwave ablation and 25 months with conventional surgery). The frequency of side effects or complications was similar between treatments, but people in the conventional surgery group more frequently required blood transfusion. The trial did not provide data on quality of life, whether metastases were eliminated, and whether cancer returned. One study in Germany allocated 50 people to microwave ablation versus another method of destroying cancer cells (using radiofrequency waves called radiofrequency ablation). The study reported that the proportion of people dying was similar in both groups. Comparable numbers of people in both groups lived for one, two, and three years. There were two minor complications in the radiofrequency ablation group. In the microwave ablation group, cancer did not return to the same area after 12 months in any participants. However, in the radiofrequency ablation group, cancer returned to the same area in two people. Cancer appeared in a different area of the body in 10 people in the microwave ablation group and nine people in the radiofrequency ablation group. The trial did not report on quality of life, time to death, and whether metastases were eliminated. Further randomised clinical trials are needed to strengthen the evidence on the effect of microwave ablation compared with treatments described above. We found no evidence for the comparison of microwave ablation with other methods of destroying cancer cells and treatments working throughout the whole body. What are the limitations of the evidence? Our confidence in the results is limited because none of the trials clearly reported their methods, or whether trial participants knew the treatment received. We still lack evidence on the effect of microwave ablation in addition to conventional TACE as compared with conventional TACE alone on death, quality of life, living longer, eliminating metastases, cancer returning, as well as on the effect of microwave ablation compared to conventional surgery and radiofrequency ablation on quality of life, eliminating metastases, and cancer returning. How up to date is this evidence? The evidence is up to date to 14 April 2023.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) is a cancer of the lymphatic system, and involves the lymph nodes, spleen and other organs such as the liver, lung, bone or bone marrow, depending on the tumour stage. With cure rates of up to 90%, HL is one of the most curable cancers worldwide. Approximately 10% of people with HL will be refractory to initial treatment or will relapse; this is more common in people with advanced stage or bulky disease. Standard of care for these people is high‐dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT), but only 55% of participants treated with high‐dose chemotherapy and ASCT are free from treatment failure at three years, with an overall survival (OS) of about 80% at three years. Checkpoint inhibitors that target the interaction of the programmed death (PD)‐1 immune checkpoint receptor, and its ligands PD‐L1 and PD‐L2, have shown remarkable activity in a wide range of malignancies. Nivolumab is an anti‐(PD)‐1 monoclonal antibody and currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of melanoma, non‐small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma and, since 2016, for classical Hodgkin's lymphoma (cHL) after treatment with ASCT and brentuximab vedotin. Objectives To assess the benefits and harms of nivolumab in adults with HL (irrespective of stage of disease). Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, conference proceedings and six study registries from January 2000 to May 2018 for prospectively planned trials evaluating nivolumab. Selection criteria We included prospectively planned trials evaluating nivolumab in adults with HL. We excluded trials in which less than 80% of participants had HL, unless the trial authors provided the subgroup data for these participants in the publication or after we contacted the trial authors. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed potential risk of bias. We used the software RobotReviewer to extract data and compared results with our findings. As we did not identify any randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or non‐RCTs, we did not meta‐analyse data. Main results Our search found 782 potentially relevant references. From these, we included three trials without a control group, with 283 participants. In addition, we identified 14 ongoing trials evaluating nivolumab, of which two are randomised. Risk of bias of the three included studies was moderate to high. All of the participants were in relapsed stage, most of them were heavily pretreated and had received at least two previous treatments, most of them had also undergone ASCT. As we did not identify any RCTs, we could not use the software RobotReviewer to assess risk of bias. The software identified correctly that one study was not an RCT and did not extract any trial data, but extracted characteristics of the other two studies (although also not RCTs) in a sufficient way. Two studies with 260 participants evaluated OS. After six months, OS was 100% in one study and median OS (the timepoint when only 50% of participants were alive) was not reached in the other trial after a median follow‐up of 18 months (interquartile range (IQR) 15 to 22 months) (very low certainty evidence, due to observational trial design, heterogenous patient population in terms of pretreatments and various follow‐up times (downgrading by 1 point)). In one study, one out of three cohorts reported quality of life. It was unclear whether there was an effect on quality of life as only a subset of participants filled out the follow‐up questionnaire (very low certainty evidence). Three trials (283 participants) evaluated progression‐free survival (PFS) (very low certainty evidence). Six‐month PFS ranged between 60% and 86%, and median PFS ranged between 12 and 18 months. All three trials (283 participants) reported complete response rates, ranging from 12% to 29%, depending on inclusion criteria and participants' previous treatments (very low certainty evidence). One trial (243 participants) reported drug‐related grade 3 or 4 adverse events (AEs) only after a median follow‐up of 18 months (IQR 15 to 22 months); these were fatigue (23%), diarrhoea (15%), infusion reactions (14%) and rash (12%). The other two trials (40 participants) reported 23% to 52% grade 3 or 4 AEs after six months' follow‐up (very low certainty evidence). Only one trial (243 participants) reported drug‐related serious AEs; 2% of participants developed infusion reactions and 1% pneumonitis (very low certainty evidence). None of the studies reported treatment‐related mortality. Authors' conclusions To date, data on OS, quality of life, PFS, response rate, or short‐ and long‐term AEs are available from small uncontrolled trials only. The three trials included heavily pretreated participants, which had previously undergone regimens of BV or ASCT. For these participants, median OS was not reached after follow‐up times of at least 16 months (more than 50% of participants with a limited life expectancy were alive at this timepoint). Only one cohort out of three only reported quality of life, with limited follow‐up data so that meaningful conclusions were not possible. Serious adverse events occurred rarely. Currently, data are too sparse to make a clear statement on nivolumab for people with relapsed or refractory HL except for heavily pretreated people, which had previously undergone regimens of BV or ASCT. When interpreting these results, it is important to consider that proper RCTs should confirm these findings. As there are 14 ongoing trials evaluating nivolumab, of which two are RCTs, it is possible that an update of this review will be published in the near future and that this update will show different results to those reported here. Plain language summary Nivolumab for adults with Hodgkin's lymphoma Background Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) is a cancer of the lymphatic system. As part of the immune system, the lymphatic system comprises a network of lymphatic vessels, which transport lymph throughout the body. Lymph is a fluid which contains white blood cells, that tackle infection. HL occurs in children and adults, but it is more common in the third decade of life. It is one of the most curable forms of cancer and up to 90% of people will be cured; however, approximately 10% of people with HL will relapse (the cancer will return). Treatment options are chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or both, or newly developed agents, called checkpoint inhibitors that target the cancer cell directly. Nivolumab is one checkpoint inhibitor and currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of various cancers and relapsed HL after treatment with stem cell transplantation and brentuximab vedotin, which is a medicine used to treat cancer. In stem cell transplantation patients receive blood building cells, so called stem cells, which replace their own when they have been destroyed along the disease or previous therapy regimens. Review question This systematic review evaluated the benefits and harms of nivolumab for adults with Hodgkin's lymphoma. Study characteristics We searched important medical databases for clinical trials assessing the benefits and harms of nivolumab in adults with HL. Two review authors independently screened, summarised and analysed the results. In addition, we tested the computer software RobotReviewer to extract data. Our search led to the inclusion of three studies involving 283 participants and 14 ongoing trials. The evidence provided is current to May 2018. Key results Two studies with 260 participants evaluated survival. After six months, all participants were alive in one trial (17 participants). One trial reported quality of life for a subgroup of participants using a questionnaire but not all follow‐up data were available. Although it seemed that the participants answering the questionnaire might have had a benefit, it was unclear whether this applied to all the participants. The studies also reported tumour control and tumour response, but with different results, depending on the treatment and how many previous treatments participants had received before nivolumab was given. As nivolumab is given until the disease progresses (gets worse) or until unacceptable side effects occur, people receive the drug for a long time. Therefore, reporting of side effects is related to the time the person received the medicine, with potentially more side effects with longer usage. The most commonly reported side effects were fatigue (tiredness), diarrhoea (loose stools), infusion reactions (during or shortly after giving the medicine by a vein) and rash. Only one study reported medicine‐related serious side effects. They occurred rarely (infusion reactions and lung disease). Deaths related to the medicine were not reported. Reliability of the evidence Due to the study design and varied type of participants with different numbers of previous treatments and various treatment options, the reliability of the evidence was low to very low. Conclusion This systematic review evaluated the benefits and harms of nivolumab in adults with HL. Data on survival, quality of life, tumour response and side effects were available from small trials only. The three trials included only people different previous treatment options, very often also with a previous stem cell transplantation. In one trial, all participants were alive after six months. Quality of life data were not reported for all the included participants; moreover, data after a long period of treatment were not available for all evaluated participants, therefore meaningful conclusions were not possible. Serious side effects occurred rarely. Currently, data are too sparse to make a clear statement on nivolumab for people with relapsed or refractory HL except for those who had received several treatments before. As there are currently 14 ongoing trials evaluating nivolumab, of which two are well designed, it is possible that an update of this review will be published in the near future and that this update will show different results to those reported here.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Ewing sarcoma is a solid tumour, which is the second most common primary bone malignancy in children, often occurring in the long bones and pelvis. An incidence rate of 4.5 per million a year is reported, with a peak incidence of 11 per million at the age of 12 years. Despite more intensive chemotherapy, 30% to 40% of young people with Ewing sarcoma will have recurrence of the disease. Less than 30% of young people with a recurrence of Ewing sarcoma are alive at 24 months, and less than 10% are alive at 48 months. High‐dose chemotherapy (HDC), followed by autologous haematopoietic cell transplantation (AHCT), is used in a variety of paediatric groups with diverse solid tumours. The hypothesis is that HDC regimens may overcome resistance to standard polychemotherapy, and this way may eradicate minimal residual disease, leading to improved survival after a first recurrence of disease. Objectives To assess the efficacy of HDC with AHCT versus conventional chemotherapy in improving event‐free survival, overall survival, quality‐adjusted survival, and progression‐free survival in children, adolescents, and young adults with first recurrence of Ewing sarcoma, and to determine the toxicity of the treatment. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, conference proceedings from the SIOP, ASPHO, CTOS, ASBMT, EBMT, and EMSOS, and two trial registries in January 2020. We also searched reference lists of relevant articles and review articles. Selection criteria We planned to include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or (historical) controlled clinical trials (CCTs) comparing the effectiveness of HDC plus AHCT with conventional chemotherapy for children, adolescents, and young adults (up to 30 years old at the date of diagnostic biopsy) with a first recurrence of Ewing sarcoma. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Main results We did not identify any eligible studies. Authors' conclusions Since we did not identify any eligible studies, we are unable to draw any conclusions about the efficacy and toxicity of HDC with AHCT versus conventional chemotherapy in children, adolescents, and young adults with a first recurrence of Ewing sarcoma. Further high‐quality research is urgently needed. Plain language summary High‐dose chemotherapy (HDC) and autologous haematopoietic cell transplantation (AHCT) for children, adolescents, and young adults with a first recurrence of Ewing sarcoma Review question We were looking for evidence on whether HDC plus AHCT improved event‐free survival, overall survival, quality‐adjusted survival, and progression‐free survival better than conventional chemotherapy in children, adolescents, and young adults with their first recurrence of Ewing sarcoma. We were also looking for adverse effects that occurred because of these treatments. Background Ewing sarcoma is a tumour that occurs in the bone and soft tissue, especially in the long bones and pelvis, and mainly in children, adolescents and young adults. Since the introduction of chemotherapy following surgery, with or without radiation, the outcome of people with Ewing sarcoma has improved. However, even with improved chemotherapy, there are still too many people who eventually die of the disease, because it has progressed or come back. People with a first recurrence of Ewing sarcoma do not have a great prognosis: fewer than 3 out of 10 young people  are still alive at 24 months, and fewer than 1 out of 10 are alive at 48 months. Improved therapy is essential for these people. High‐dose chemotherapy (HDC), followed by autologous haematopoietic cell transplantation (AHCT; intravenous infusion of earlier collected stem cells to re‐establish bone marrow ), is successfully used for young people with a variety of tumours. Theoretically, this seems to be a good option to treat the small number of remaining cancer cells, and to improve the survival rate after the first recurrence of Ewing sarcoma. Key results We conducted an extensive search of the medical literature, including related conference proceedings, and registers for ongoing trials, but we did not find any relevant studies. Therefore, we are unable to draw any conclusions as to whether HDC with AHCT improves event‐free survival, overall survival, quality‐adjusted survival, or progression‐free survival better than conventional chemotherapy, or if it causes any side effects, in children, adolescents, and young adults with their first recurrence of Ewing sarcoma. Our results show that further research is needed. How current is the evidence The evidence is current to January 2020.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Cutaneous melanoma is amongst the most aggressive of all skin cancers. Neoadjuvant treatment is a form of induction therapy, given to shrink a cancerous tumour prior to the main treatment (usually surgery). The purpose is to improve survival and surgical outcomes. This review systematically appraises the literature investigating the use of neoadjuvant treatment for stage III and IV cutaneous melanoma. Objectives To assess the effects of neoadjuvant treatment in adults with stage III or stage IV melanoma according to the seventh edition American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system. Search methods We searched the following databases up to 10 August 2021 inclusive: Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS and four trials registers, together with reference checking and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. We also handsearched proceedings from specific conferences from 2016 to 2020 inclusive. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of people with stage III and IV melanoma, comparing neoadjuvant treatment strategies (using targeted treatments, immunotherapies, radiotherapy, topical treatments or chemotherapy) with any of these agents or current standard of care (SOC), were eligible for inclusion. Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane methods. Primary outcomes were overall survival (OS) and adverse effects (AEs). Secondary outcomes included time to recurrence (TTR), quality of life (QOL), and overall response rate (ORR). We used GRADE to evaluate the certainty of the evidence. Main results We included eight RCTs involving 402 participants. Studies enrolled adults, mostly with stage III melanoma, investigated immunotherapies, chemotherapy, or targeted treatments, and compared these with surgical excision with or without adjuvant treatment. Duration of follow‐up and therapeutic regimens varied, which, combined with heterogeneity in the population and definitions of the endpoints, precluded meta‐analysis of all identified studies. We performed a meta‐analysis including three studies. We are very uncertain if neoadjuvant treatment increases OS when compared to no neoadjuvant treatment (hazard ratio (HR) 0.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15 to 1.21; 2 studies, 171 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Neoadjuvant treatment may increase the rate of AEs, but the evidence is very uncertain (26% versus 16%, risk ratio (RR) 1.58, 95% CI 0.97 to 2.55; 2 studies, 162 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). We are very uncertain if neoadjuvant treatment increases TTR (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.17; 2 studies, 171 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Studies did not report ORR as a comparative outcome or measure QOL data. We are very uncertain whether neoadjuvant targeted treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib increases OS (HR 0.28, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.25; 1 study, 21 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) or TTR (HR 0.02, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.22; 1 study, 21 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) when compared to surgery. The study did not report comparative rates of AEs and overall response, and did not measure QOL. We are very uncertain if neoadjuvant immunotherapy with talimogene laherparepvec increases OS when compared to no neoadjuvant treatment (HR 0.49, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.64; 1 study, 150 participants, very low‐certainty evidence). It may have a higher rate of AEs, but the evidence is very uncertain (16.5% versus 5.8%, RR 2.84, 95% CI 0.96 to 8.37; 1 study, 142 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). We are very uncertain if it increases TTR (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.79; 1 study, 150 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). The study did not report comparative ORRs or measure QOL. OS was not reported for neoadjuvant immunotherapy (combined ipilimumab and nivolumab) when compared to the combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab as adjuvant treatment. There may be little or no difference in the rate of AEs between these treatments (9%, RR 1.0, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.34; 1 study, 20 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The study did not report comparative ORRs or measure TTR and QOL. Neoadjuvant immunotherapy (combined ipilimumab and nivolumab) likely results in little to no difference in OS when compared to neoadjuvant nivolumab monotherapy (P = 0.18; 1 study, 23 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). It may increase the rate of AEs, but the certainty of this evidence is very low (72.8% versus 8.3%, RR 8.73, 95% CI 1.29 to 59; 1 study, 23 participants); this trial was halted early due to observation of disease progression preventing surgical resection in the monotherapy arm and the high rate of treatment‐related AEs in the combination arm. Neoadjuvant combination treatment may lead to higher ORR, but the evidence is very uncertain (72.8% versus 25%, RR 2.91, 95% CI 1.02 to 8.27; 1 study, 23 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). It likely results in little to no difference in TTR (P = 0.19; 1 study, 23 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The study did not measure QOL. OS was not reported for neoadjuvant immunotherapy (combined ipilimumab and nivolumab) when compared to neoadjuvant sequential immunotherapy (ipilimumab then nivolumab). Only Grade 3 to 4 immune‐related AEs were reported; fewer were reported with combination treatment, and the sequential treatment arm closed early due to a high incidence of severe AEs. The neoadjuvant combination likely results in a higher ORR compared to sequential neoadjuvant treatment (60.1% versus 42.3%, RR 1.42, 95% CI 0.87 to 2.32; 1 study, 86 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The study did not measure TTR and QOL. No data were reported on OS, AEs, TTR, or QOL for the comparison of neoadjuvant interferon (HDI) plus chemotherapy versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Neoadjuvant HDI plus chemotherapy may have little to no effect on ORR, but the evidence is very uncertain (33% versus 22%, RR 1.75, 95% CI 0.62 to 4.95; 1 study, 36 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Authors' conclusions We are uncertain if neoadjuvant treatment increases OS or TTR compared with no neoadjuvant treatment, and it may be associated with a slightly higher rate of AEs. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of neoadjuvant treatment in clinical practice. Priorities for research include the development of a core outcome set for neoadjuvant trials that are adequately powered, with validation of pathological and radiological responses as intermediate endpoints, to investigate the relative benefits of neoadjuvant treatment compared with adjuvant treatment with immunotherapies or targeted therapies. Plain language summary What are the benefits and risks of neoadjuvant treatment (drug treatment prior to surgery to remove a tumour) for melanoma, a type of skin cancer? What did we want to find out? Cutaneous melanoma is a very aggressive form of skin cancer. It is generally fatal if detected at an advanced stage. Earlier treatment may allow for surgical removal of the tumour and an improved chance of long‐term survival. Neoadjuvant treatment is drug treatment administered before surgery, to reduce the tumour size so that it is easier to remove, to reduce complications of surgery, and to reduce the risk of spread of the disease. New drug types, immunotherapies and targeted treatments, have been developed which may be effective for neoadjuvant use. We wanted to find out if neoadjuvant treatment of stage III or IV melanoma helps people live longer, and to compare adverse (unwanted) effects with neoadjuvant treatment and routine care. What did we do? We searched the medical literature for randomised controlled trials that compared certain types of treatments for melanoma skin cancer. The types of treatment included are: ‐ targeted treatments ‐ such as dabrafenib and trametinib; ‐ immunotherapies ‐ such as ipilimumab and nivolumab; ‐ chemotherapy ‐ such as dacarbazine and temozolomide; ‐ topical treatments ‐ such as imiquimod; ‐ radiotherapy. We considered both single‐drug and combination‐drug treatments. We described and compared the results from these studies, taking into account the differences between the studies. What did we find? We identified eight randomised controlled trials that included 402 adults. The majority of people had stage III melanoma and were treated in hospital. Most studies used immunotherapies or targeted treatments, and compared these with surgery, with or without adjuvant treatment (treatment given after surgery to remove the tumour, to reduce the risk of the tumour coming back). No studies considered the impact of treatment on quality of life, and most studies did not compare tumour response rates after different treatments. We are uncertain whether neoadjuvant treatment helps people live longer when compared with no neoadjuvant treatment. It may lead to more adverse events, and we are uncertain if it increases the time until the tumour comes back. We are uncertain whether neoadjuvant targeted treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib helps people live longer, compared with no neoadjuvant treatment, or if it can increase the time until the tumour comes back. The study did not compare safety outcomes with each treatment. We are uncertain if neoadjuvant immunotherapy with talimogene laherparepvec (T‐VEC) helps people live longer when compared with no neoadjuvant treatment. It may lead to more adverse events. We are uncertain if it increases the time until the tumour comes back. No data were reported on whether neoadjuvant immunotherapy with combined ipilimumab and nivolumab helps people live longer, when compared with adjuvant (treatment given only after surgery) combined ipilimumab and nivolumab. There may be little or no difference in the rate of adverse events. No data were reported on whether neoadjuvant immunotherapy with combined ipilimumab and nivolumab increases the time until the tumour comes back. Neoadjuvant combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab likely results in little or no difference in how long people live, when compared with neoadjuvant nivolumab. It may increase the rate of adverse events, but our confidence in the evidence is very low. It is worth noting that this trial was stopped early as patients in the neoadjuvant nivolumab arm may not be able to receive surgery due to disease progression and also because of a high rate of treatment‐related adverse events in the combination treatment arm. Combination treatment may lead to higher tumour response rates, but our confidence in the evidence is very low. The time until the tumour comes back may not be different. No data were available on whether neoadjuvant immunotherapy with combined ipilimumab and nivolumab helps people live longer, when compared with neoadjuvant sequential treatment with ipilimumab and nivolumab. It likely results in fewer adverse events compared to sequential treatment, and may result in higher tumour response rates. The sequential treatment arm of the trial stopped recruiting patients due to a high incidence of severe AEs. Data on the time taken for the tumour to return were not collected. No data were reported on whether neoadjuvant high‐dose interferon plus chemotherapy, when compared to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, can help people live longer, increase the time taken for the tumour to reoccur, reduce adverse events, or impact quality of life. It may have little to no effect on tumour response rates. What does this mean? We are uncertain if neoadjuvant treatment of stage III or IV melanoma will help people to live longer, or to have more time before the disease recurs. We are also uncertain if the benefits of neoadjuvant treatment outweigh the risks of adverse events. How up to date is this evidence? The evidence is up to date to August 2021.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Since the approval of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, angiogenesis inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors, the treatment landscape for advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has changed fundamentally. Today, combined therapies from different drug categories have a firm place in a complex first‐line therapy. Due to the large number of drugs available, it is necessary to identify the most effective therapies, whilst considering their side effects and impact on quality of life (QoL). Objectives To evaluate and compare the benefits and harms of first‐line therapies for adults with advanced RCC, and to produce a clinically relevant ranking of therapies. Secondary objectives were to maintain the currency of the evidence by conducting continuous update searches, using a living systematic review approach, and to incorporate data from clinical study reports (CSRs). Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, conference proceedings and relevant trial registries up until 9 February 2022. We searched several data platforms to identify CSRs. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating at least one targeted therapy or immunotherapy for first‐line treatment of adults with advanced RCC. We excluded trials evaluating only interleukin‐2 versus interferon‐alpha as well as trials with an adjuvant treatment setting. We also excluded trials with adults who received prior systemic anticancer therapy if more than 10% of participants were previously treated, or if data for untreated participants were not separately extractable. Data collection and analysis All necessary review steps (i.e. screening and study selection, data extraction, risk of bias and certainty assessments) were conducted independently by at least two review authors. Our outcomes were overall survival (OS), QoL, serious adverse events (SAEs), progression‐free survival (PFS), adverse events (AEs), the number of participants who discontinued study treatment due to an AE, and the time to initiation of first subsequent therapy. Where possible, analyses were conducted for the different risk groups (favourable, intermediate, poor) according to the International Metastatic Renal‐Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium Score (IMDC) or the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) criteria. Our main comparator was sunitinib (SUN). A hazard ratio (HR) or risk ratio (RR) lower than 1.0 is in favour of the experimental arm. Main results We included 36 RCTs and 15,177 participants (11,061 males and 4116 females). Risk of bias was predominantly judged as being 'high' or 'some concerns' across most trials and outcomes. This was mainly due to a lack of information about the randomisation process, the blinding of outcome assessors, and methods for outcome measurements and analyses. Additionally, study protocols and statistical analysis plans were rarely available. Here we present the results for our primary outcomes OS, QoL, and SAEs, and for all risk groups combined for contemporary treatments: pembrolizumab + axitinib (PEM+AXI), avelumab + axitinib (AVE+AXI), nivolumab + cabozantinib (NIV+CAB), lenvatinib + pembrolizumab (LEN+PEM), nivolumab + ipilimumab (NIV+IPI), CAB, and pazopanib (PAZ). Results per risk group and results for our secondary outcomes are reported in the summary of findings tables and in the full text of this review. The evidence on other treatments and comparisons can also be found in the full text. Overall survival (OS) Across risk groups, PEM+AXI (HR 0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50 to 1.07, moderate certainty) and NIV+IPI (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.00, moderate certainty) probably improve OS, compared to SUN, respectively. LEN+PEM may improve OS (HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.03, low certainty), compared to SUN. There is probably little or no difference in OS between PAZ and SUN (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.32, moderate certainty), and we are uncertain whether CAB improves OS when compared to SUN (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.64, very low certainty). The median survival is 28 months when treated with SUN. Survival may improve to 43 months with LEN+PEM, and probably improves to: 41 months with NIV+IPI, 39 months with PEM+AXI, and 31 months with PAZ. We are uncertain whether survival improves to 34 months with CAB. Comparison data were not available for AVE+AXI and NIV+CAB. Quality of life (QoL) One RCT measured QoL using FACIT‐F (score range 0 to 52; higher scores mean better QoL) and reported that the mean post‐score was 9.00 points higher (9.86 lower to 27.86 higher, very low certainty) with PAZ than with SUN. Comparison data were not available for PEM+AXI, AVE+AXI, NIV+CAB, LEN+PEM, NIV+IPI, and CAB. Serious adverse events (SAEs) Across risk groups, PEM+AXI probably increases slightly the risk for SAEs (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.85, moderate certainty) compared to SUN. LEN+PEM (RR 1.52, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.19, moderate certainty) and NIV+IPI (RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.97, moderate certainty) probably increase the risk for SAEs, compared to SUN, respectively. There is probably little or no difference in the risk for SAEs between PAZ and SUN (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.31, moderate certainty). We are uncertain whether CAB reduces or increases the risk for SAEs (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.43, very low certainty) when compared to SUN. People have a mean risk of 40% for experiencing SAEs when treated with SUN. The risk increases probably to: 61% with LEN+PEM, 57% with NIV+IPI, and 52% with PEM+AXI. It probably remains at 40% with PAZ. We are uncertain whether the risk reduces to 37% with CAB. Comparison data were not available for AVE+AXI and NIV+CAB. Authors' conclusions Findings concerning the main treatments of interest comes from direct evidence of one trial only, thus results should be interpreted with caution. More trials are needed where these interventions and combinations are compared head‐to‐head, rather than just to SUN. Moreover, assessing the effect of immunotherapies and targeted therapies on different subgroups is essential and studies should focus on assessing and reporting relevant subgroup data. The evidence in this review mostly applies to advanced clear cell RCC. Plain language summary Initial treatment for adults with advanced kidney cancer (renal cell carcinoma) Abbreviations • renal cell carcinoma (RCC) • avelumab (AVE) • axitinib (AXI) • cabozantinib (CAB) • ipilimumab (IPI) • lenvatinib (LEN)) • nivolumab (NIV) • pazopanib (PAZ) • pembrolizumab (PEM) • sunitinib (SUN) Key messages • When making treatment decisions, it is important to think about whether drugs lengthen life, and whether they decrease or increase harmful side effects. • The findings in this review apply mostly to advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with a clear cell component. What is advanced RCC, and how is it treated? RCC is a type of kidney cancer. It is more common in older people and in men than in women. This is because age (≥60 years) and male sex put people at higher risk of getting it. Other risk factors include body weight, smoking, a history of kidney stones and high blood pressure. More than half of people with RCC discover they have it from routine health check‐ups, because many do not have symptoms in the early stages. When symptoms appear, they can impact people's quality of life and day‐to‐day activities. Before 2005, drugs for treatment of advanced RCC were few and treatments caused many side effects. Now, there are new types of drugs: immunotherapy (use people’s own immune system to find and destroy cancer cells), or targeted therapy (interferes with molecules that are responsible for helping cancer cells to grow, divide, and spread). Combinations of these drugs are used for therapy. With these drugs, people may live longer, with a good quality of life and fewer or milder side effects. These drugs are evaluated in clinical studies with people with RCC. What did we want to find out? We wanted to use the most up‐to‐date information from clinical studies to measure the benefits and harms of different treatments for people with advanced RCC. We also wanted to learn if the drugs worked better for some people than others.  What did we do? We searched for studies that explored different drugs that are immunotherapies or targeted therapies. We examined these in adults (≥18 years) with advanced RCC who receive their first therapy. We compared these drugs to the drug SUN, which is a widely used targeted drug and a commonly used comparator drug in studies. We used a standardised process to assess the quality of the findings and our certainty in them. We rated our certainty in the findings based on factors such as study methods, the number of participants in them, and the precision of study results.  What did we find? We found 36 studies with 4116 women and 11,061 men, around 60 years of age, with advanced RCC. Most people had ≥2 metastatic sites. We found 22 drugs and 17 combinations of drugs that were measured in the studies. We also performed analyses for different risk groups of advanced RCC. We present and discuss our results for the different risk groups, drugs and combinations in the main text of this review, plus further outcomes. Below we present our main results for our primary outcomes, when all risk groups are combined. We focus on selected drugs (and combinations) (PEM+AXI, AVE+AXI, NIV+CAB, LEN+PEM, NIV+IPI, CAB alone, PAZ alone) that are currently recommended in international guidelines for the treatment of advanced RCC. We report their impact on survival, quality of life and serious side effects. How long do people live? People live an average of 28 months when treated with SUN. In comparison, people may live an average of 43 months with LEN+PEM, probably 41 months with NIV+IPI, probably 39 months with PEM+AXI, and probably 31 months with PAZ alone. We are uncertain whether people live an average of 34 months with CAB alone. We do not have information for AVE+AXI and NIV+CAB. How do people rate their quality of life? People who receive PAZ alone reported a higher level of quality of life than people who receive SUN, but we are uncertain about the findings. We do not have information for PEM+AXI, AVE+AXI, NIV+CAB, LEN+PEM, NIV+IPI or CAB alone.  What is people's risk for serious side effects? People who receive SUN have an average risk of 40% for experiencing serious side effects. In comparison, the average risk is probably: 61% with LEN+PEM, 57% with NIV+IPI, 52% with PEM+AXI, and 40% with PAZ. We are uncertain whether the risk is on average 37% with CAB alone. We do not have information for AVE+AXI and NIV+CAB. What are the limitations of the evidence? More studies are needed where these new drugs (and combinations) are not only compared to SUN alone, but also to each other. We lack information on the comparative benefits and harms of these drugs in different people, e.g. when comparing men with women, or different histology types of RCC (e.g. clear cell type, papillary type, sarcomatoid type). How up to date is this evidence? We conducted our last search for studies in February 2022 and incorporated the most recent study results into this review. },

abstract = {Abstract - Background : Colon cancer is potentially curable by surgery. Although adjuvant chemotherapy benefits patients with stage III disease, there is uncertainty of such benefit in stage II colon cancer. A systematic review of the literature was performed to better define the potential benefits of adjuvant therapy for patients with stage II colon cancer. Objectives : To determine the effects of adjuvant therapy on overall survival and disease‐free survival in patients with stage II colon cancer. Search methods : Ovid MEDLINE(R) (1986‐2007), EMBASE (1980‐2007), and EBM Reviews ‐ Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( to 2007) were searched using the medical headings "colonic neoplasms", "colorectal neoplasms", "adjuvant chemotherapy", "adjuvant radiotherapy" and "immunotherapy", and the text words "colon cancer" and "colonic neoplasms". In addition, proceedings from the annual meetings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the European Society of Medical Oncology (1996 to 2004) as well as personal files were searched for additional information. Selection criteria : Randomized trials or meta‐analyses containing data on stage II colon cancer patients undergoing adjuvant therapy versus surgery alone. Data collection and analysis : Three reviewers summarized the results of selected studies. The main outcomes of interest were overall and disease‐free survival, however, data on toxicity and treatment delivery were also recorded. Main results : With regards to the effect of adjuvant therapy on stage II colon cancer, the pooled relative risk ratio for overall survival was 0.96 (95% confidence interval 0.88, 1.05). With regards to disease‐free survival, the pooled relative risk ratio was 0.83 (95% confidence interval 0.75, 0.92). Authors' conclusions : Although there was no improvement in overall survival in the pooled analysis, we did find that disease‐free survival in patients with stage II colon cancer was signficantly better with the use of adjuvant therapy. It seems reasonable to discuss the benefits of adjuvant systemic chemotherapy with those stage II patients who have high risk features, including obstruction, perforation, inadequate lymph node sampling or T4 disease. The co‐morbidities and likelihood of tolerating adjuvant systemic chemotherapy should be considered as well. There exists a need to further define which high‐risk features in stage II colon cancer patients should be used to select patients for adjuvant therapy. Also, researchers must continue to search for other therapies which might be more effective, shorter in duration and less toxic than those available today. Plain language summary Adjuvant therapy for completely resected stage II colon cancer Colon cancer is the second most common cause of cancer deaths in the Western world. A large proportion of colon cancer patients can be cured by surgical resection alone. For those patients with lymph node positive (stage III) disease, the recurrence rate can exceed 50% and adjuvant chemotherapy has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of recurrence. In patients without lymph node involvement (stage I and II), the prognosis is quite good with surgery alone, with survival rates of 75% to 95% at 5 years. However, some patients with high risk stage II disease have a relapse rate approaching that of stage III colon cancer patients. Due to the effectiveness of systemic chemotherapy in stage III disease, a similar approach has been considered for patients with stage II disease. We performed a systematic review looking at all randomized clinical trials evaluating stage II colon cancer patients and adjuvant therapy versus surgery alone. Our review found that adjuvant therapy ‐either systemic or regional chemotherapy or immunotherapy‐ can improve the outcomes of stage II patients. In counselling individual patients, the advice given should be conditioned by the patient's age and comorbidities. In addition, the high risk features of the tumour should also be considered when contemplating the benefits of systemic therapy in patients with stage II colon cancer. Further investigation is needed to elucidate which patient and tumour factors can be used to select stage II colon cancer patients for adjuvant therapy. There also exists a need to continue to search for other adjuvant therapies which might be more effective, shorter in duration and less toxic than those available today.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Ewing sarcomas are solid tumours of the bone and soft tissue, that usually affect children, adolescents, and young adults. The incidence is about three cases per million a year, with a peak incidence at 12 years of age. Metastatic disease is detected in about 20 % to 30% of people, and is typically found in the lungs, bone, bone marrow, or a combination of these. Presence of metastatic disease at diagnosis (primary metastatic disease) is the most important adverse prognostic factor, and is associated with a five‐year survival lower than 30%. High‐dose chemotherapy (HDC) followed by autologous haematopoietic cell transplantation (AHCT) is used in various solid tumours with unfavourable prognoses in children, adolescents, and young adults. It has also been used as rescue after multifocal radiation of metastases. The hypothesis is that HDC regimens may overcome the resistance to standard multidrug chemotherapy and improve survival rates. Objectives To assess the effects of high‐dose chemotherapy with autologous haematopoietic cell transplantation compared with conventional chemotherapy in improving event‐free survival, overall survival, quality‐adjusted survival, and progression‐free survival in children, adolescents, and young adults with primary metastatic Ewing sarcoma, and to determine the toxicity of the treatment. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, conference proceedings from major international cancer‐related conferences, and ongoing trial registers until January 2020. We also searched reference lists of included articles and review articles. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or (historical) controlled clinical trials (CCTs) comparing the effectiveness of HDC and AHCT with conventional chemotherapy for children, adolescents, and young adults (younger than 30 years at the date of diagnostic biopsy) with primary metastatic Ewing sarcoma. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Main results We identified one RCT, which investigated the effects of HDC with AHCT versus conventional chemotherapy with whole lung irradiation (WLI) in people with Ewing sarcoma metastasised to the lungs only at diagnosis. Only a selection of the participants were eligible for our review (N = 267: HDC with AHCT group N = 134; control group N = 133). There may be no difference in event‐free survival between the two treatment groups (hazard ratio (HR) 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 1.17; low‐certainty evidence). We downgraded one level each because of study limitations and imprecision. Overall survival and toxicity were not reported separately for the participants eligible for this review, while quality‐adjusted survival and progression‐free survival were not reported at all. We did not identify any studies that addressed children, adolescents, and young adults with Ewing sarcoma with metastases to other locations. Authors' conclusions In people with Ewing sarcoma with primary metastases to locations other than the lungs, there is currently no evidence from RCTs or CCTs to determine the efficacy of HDC with AHCT compared to conventional chemotherapy. Based on low‐certainty evidence from one study (267 participants), there may be no difference in event‐free survival between children, adolescents, and young adults with primary pulmonary metastatic Ewing sarcoma who receive HDC with AHCT and those who receive conventional chemotherapy with WLI. Further high‐quality research is needed. Results are anticipated for the EuroEwing 2008R3 study, in which the effects of HDC with treosulfan and melphalan followed by AHCT on survival, in people with Ewing sarcoma with metastatic disease to bone, other sites, or both were explored. Achieving high‐quality studies in a selection of people with rare sarcoma requires long‐term, multi‐centre, international participant inclusion. Plain language summary High‐dose chemotherapy and haematopoietic cell transplantation for children, adolescents, and young adults with metastatic Ewing sarcoma at diagnosis Review question We were looking for evidence on whether high‐dose chemotherapy plus autologous haematopoietic cell transplantation (intravenous infusion of stem cells collected previously from the patient to re‐establish bone marrow) improved event‐free survival, overall survival, quality‐adjusted survival, and progression‐free survival better than conventional chemotherapy in children, adolescents, and young adults with primary metastatic Ewing sarcoma (cancer that has spread to other parts of the body at time of diagnosis). We were also looking for adverse effects that occurred because of these treatments. Background Ewing sarcoma is a tumour that usually occurs in the bone and soft tissue of children and young adults. People with metastatic Ewing sarcoma at diagnosis have a poor chance of survival. Less than 30% of affected people survive after five years. People with solitary lung metastases have a better chance of survival (50% survival after five years). Current treatment consists of multidrug chemotherapy combined with surgery, radiotherapy, or both. Improved therapy is essential for these people. We conducted this review to find out whether high‐dose chemotherapy, combined with autologous haematopoietic cell transplantation can help to improve survival in children, adolescents, and young adults with metastatic Ewing sarcoma at diagnosis, compared to conventional chemotherapy. Study characteristics We identified one study (267 participants, who were included over a 15‐year period, from 144 international centres) that compared high dose chemotherapy plus autologous haematopoietic cell transplantation with conventional chemotherapy and whole lung irradiation in children, adolescents, and young adults with Ewing sarcoma with pulmonary metastases at diagnosis. Key results In young people with pulmonary metastatic Ewing sarcoma at diagnosis, low‐certainty evidence from one study found no clear difference between treatment groups in event‐free survival. There were no data available for overall survival, quality‐adjusted survival, adverse effects, or progression‐free survival. We did not find any studies that addressed children, adolescents, and young adults with Ewing sarcoma that had metastasised to locations besides the lungs at diagnosis. We need high‐quality research before definite conclusions can be made. Certainty of the evidence The certainty of the evidence was low. How current is the evidence The evidence is current to January 2020.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Oral cancers are the sixth most common cancer worldwide, yet the prognosis following a diagnosis of oral cavity or oropharyngeal cancers remains poor, with approximately 50% survival at five years. Despite a sharp increase in research into molecularly targeted therapies and a rapid expansion in the number of clinical trials assessing new targeted therapies, their value for treating oral cancers is unclear. Therefore, it is important to summarise the evidence to determine the efficacy and toxicity of targeted therapies and immunotherapies for the treatment of these cancers. Objectives To assess the effects of molecularly targeted therapies and immunotherapies, in addition to standard therapies, for the treatment of oral cavity or oropharyngeal cancers. Search methods We searched the following electronic databases: Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register (to 3 February 2015), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library , 2015, Issue 1), MEDLINE via Ovid (1946 to 3 February 2015) and EMBASE via Ovid (1980 to 3 February 2015). We searched the US National Institutes of Health Trials Register ( clinicaltrials.gov ), the World Health Organization Clinical Trials Registry Platform, the American Society of Clinical Oncology conference abstracts and the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group clinical trials protocols for ongoing trials. We placed no restrictions on the language or date of publication. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials where more than 50% of participants had primary tumours of the oral cavity or oropharynx, and which compared targeted therapy or immunotherapy, plus standard therapy, with standard therapy alone. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened the results of the electronic searches, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. We attempted to contact study authors for missing data or clarification where necessary. We combined sufficiently similar studies in meta‐analyses using random‐effects models when there were at least four studies and fixed‐effect models when fewer than four studies. We obtained or calculated a hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the primary outcomes where possible. For dichotomous outcomes, we reported risk ratios (RR) and 95% CIs. Main results Twelve trials (2488 participants) satisfied the inclusion criteria. In the included trials, 12% of participants (298 participants) had tumours of the oral cavity and 59% (1468 participants) had oropharyngeal tumours. The remaining 29% had tumours of the larynx or hypopharynx and less than 1% had tumours at other sites. No included trial was at low risk of bias; seven had an unclear risk of bias, and five had a high risk of bias. We grouped trials by intervention type into three main comparisons: standard therapy plus epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibody (EGFR mAb) therapy (follow‐up period 24 to 70 months); standard therapy plus tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) (follow‐up period 40 to 60 months) and standard therapy plus immunotherapy (follow‐up period 24 to 70 months), all versus standard therapy alone. Moderate quality evidence showed that EGFR mAb therapy may result in 18% fewer deaths when added to standard therapy (HR of mortality 0.82; 95% CI 0.69 to 0.97; 1421 participants, three studies, 67% oropharyngeal tumours, 2% oral cavity tumours). There was also moderate quality evidence that EGFR mAb may result in 32% fewer locoregional failures when added to radiotherapy (RT) (HR 0.68; 95% CI 0.52 to 0.89; 424 participants, one study, 60% oropharyngeal tumours). A subgroup analysis separating studies by type of standard therapy (radiotherapy (RT) or chemoradiotherapy (CRT)) showed some evidence that adding EGFR mAb therapy to RT may result in a 30% reduction in the number of people whose disease progresses (HR 0.70; 95% CI 0.54 to 0.91; 424 participants, one study, 60% oropharyngeal tumours, unclear risk of bias). For the subgroup comparing EGFR mAb plus CRT with CRT alone there was insufficient evidence to determine whether adding EGFR mAb therapy to CRT impacts on progression‐free survival (HR 1.08; 95% CI 0.89 to 1.32; 891 participants, one study, 70% oropharyngeal tumours, high risk of bias). The high subgroup heterogeneity meant that we were unable to pool these subgroups. There was evidence that adding cetuximab to standard therapy may result in increased skin toxicity and rash (RR 6.56; 95% CI 5.35 to 8.03; 1311 participants, two studies), but insufficient evidence to determine any difference in skin toxicity and rash in the case of nimotuzumab (RR 1.06; 95% CI 0.85 to 1.31; 92 participants, one study). There was insufficient evidence to determine whether TKIs added to standard therapy impacts on overall survival (HR 0.99; 95% CI 0.62 to 1.57; 271 participants, two studies; very low quality evidence), locoregional control (HR 0.89; 95% CI 0.53 to 1.49; 271 participants, two studies; very low quality evidence), disease‐free survival (HR 1.51; 95% CI 0.61 to 3.71; 60 participants, one study; very low quality evidence) or progression‐free survival (HR 0.80; 95% CI 0.51 to 1.28; 271 participants, two studies; very low quality evidence). We did find evidence of an increase in skin rash (erlotinib: RR 6.57; 95% CI 3.60 to 12.00; 191 participants, one study; lapatinib: RR 2.02; 95% CI 1.23 to 3.32; 67 participants, one study) and gastrointestinal complaints (lapatinib: RR 15.53; 95% CI 2.18 to 110.55; 67 participants, one study). We found very low quality evidence from one small trial that adding recombinant interleukin (rIL‐2) to surgery may increase overall survival (HR 0.52; 95% CI 0.31 to 0.87; 201 participants, 62% oral cavity tumours, 38% oropharyngeal tumours) and there was insufficient evidence to determine whether rIL‐2 impacts on adverse effects. Authors' conclusions We found some evidence that adding EGFR mAb to standard therapy may increase overall survival, progression‐free survival and locoregional control, while resulting in an increase in skin toxicity for some mAb (cetuximab). There is insufficient evidence to determine whether adding TKIs to standard therapies changes any of our primary outcomes. Very low quality evidence from a single study suggests that rIL‐2 combined with surgery may increase overall survival compared with surgery alone. Plain language summary Treatments for cancers of the mouth and throat: therapies targeted at cancer cells and therapies to boost the body’s immune system Review question This review looks at the evidence for the benefits of new kinds of therapies for treating cancer of the mouth (oral cavity cancer) and cancer of the throat (oropharyngeal cancer) used together with standard treatments. One is the targeting of cancer cells directly whilst the other aims to boost the body’s own immune system to combat the cancer more effectively. Do these treatments result in differences in overall survival, cancer‐free survival, keeping the cancer limited to that area of the body, recurrence of the cancer, quality of life and harmful or unwanted effects? Background Oral cancers (cancer of the mouth and cancer of the throat) are the sixth most common cancer worldwide, accounting for an estimated 4% of all cancers. There is a higher frequency of these cancers in men. Smoking, alcohol consumption and betel quid chewing are the main risk factors. Cancer of the throat is associated with infection from the human papilloma virus (HPV), which can be transmitted through sexual contact. Low socioeconomic status (a measure of a person's income, education and occupation in relation to other people's) is associated with a higher frequency of oral cancers and poorer survival rates. Survival following a diagnosis of mouth or throat cancer remains poor, with around 50% of people still alive at five years (five‐year survival rate). New therapies targeted at the cells that give rise to oral cancers are being developed. The advantage these may have over conventional chemotherapy is that rather than affecting both healthy and cancerous cells they just target cancer cells. Immunotherapy (also known as biological therapy, biotherapy or biological response modifier therapy) may improve the functioning of the immune system so it is more effective at destroying cancer cells. Local immunotherapy delivers treatment directly into the tumour and systemic immunotherapy targets the whole body, and may be useful for stopping the cancer spreading or the return of primary tumours in more advanced cancer. Study characteristics The evidence in this review is up‐to‐date as of February 2015 .  We found 12 studies suitable for inclusion with a total of 2488 participants. Twelve per cent of participants (298) had tumours in the mouth and 59% (1468) had tumours in the throat. The remaining 29% of participants had tumours of the voice box or lower part of throat and less than 1% had tumours at other sites. We grouped trials by treatment into three main comparisons: standard therapy with or without epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibody (EGFR mAb) therapy (which is a targeted therapy), standard therapy with or without tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) (which is a targeted therapy) and standard therapy with or without immunotherapy (which is an immune‐boosting therapy). Key results We found that adding EGFR mAb, a targeted therapy, to standard therapy may increase overall survival, cancer‐free survival, keeping the cancer limited to that area of the body and may decrease recurrence of the cancer. However, it may result in an increase in skin problems for some. There is not enough evidence to know whether TKIs added to standard therapies results in a change in overall survival, cancer‐free survival, keeping the cancer limited to that area of the body or recurrence of the cancer. One study suggested that a type of immunotherapy, rIL‐2, combined with surgery, may increase overall survival. Quality of the evidence Overall, the evidence available ranges from moderate quality (for EGFR mAb) to very low quality (for TKIs and rIL‐2), which limits our confidence in the reliability of our findings.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background The liver is affected by two of the most common groups of malignant tumours: primary liver tumours and liver metastases from colorectal carcinoma or other extrahepatic primary cancers. Liver metastases are significantly more common than primary liver cancer, and the reported long‐term survival rate after radical surgical treatment is approximately 50%. However, R0 resection (resection for cure) is not feasible in the majority of patients; therefore, other treatments have to be considered. One of these is percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI), which causes dehydration and necrosis of tumour cells, accompanied by small‐vessel thrombosis, leading to tumour ischaemia and destruction of the tumour. Objectives To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) compared with no intervention, other ablation methods, or systemic treatments in people with liver metastases. Search methods We searched the following databases up to 10 September 2019: the Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE Ovid; Embase Ovid; Science Citation Index Expanded; Conference Proceedings Citation Index – Science; Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS); and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL). We also searched clinical trials registers such as ClinicalTrials.gov, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (17 September 2019) . Selection criteria Randomised clinical trials assessing beneficial and harmful effects of percutaneous ethanol injection and its comparators (no intervention, other ablation methods, systemic treatments) for liver metastases. Data collection and analysis We followed standard methodological procedures as outlined by Cochrane. We extracted information on participant characteristics, interventions, study outcomes, study design, and trial methods. Two review authors performed data extraction and assessed risk of bias independently. We assessed the certainty of evidence by using GRADE. We resolved disagreements by discussion. Main results We identified only one randomised clinical trial comparing percutaneous intratumour ethanol injection (PEI) in addition to transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation (TACE) versus TACE alone. The trial was conducted in China and included 48 trial participants with liver metastases: 25 received PEI plus TACE, and 23 received TACE alone. The trial included 37 male and 11 female participants. Mean participant age was 49.3 years. Sites of primary tumours included colon (27 cases), stomach (12 cases), pancreas (3 cases), lung (3 cases), breast (2 cases), and ovary (1 case). Seven participants had a single tumour, 15 had two tumours, and 26 had three or more tumours in the liver. The bulk diameter of the tumour on average was 3.9 cm, ranging from 1.2 cm to 7.6 cm. Participants were followed for 10 months to 43 months. The trial reported survival data after one, two, and three years. In the PEI + TACE group, 92%, 80%, and 64% of participants survived after one year, two years, and three years; in the TACE alone group, these percentages were 78.3%, 65.2%, and 47.8%, respectively. Upon conversion of these data to mortality rates, the calculated risk ratio (RR) for mortality at last follow‐up when PEI plus TACE was compared with TACE alone was 0.69 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36 to 1.33; very low‐certainty evidence) after three years of follow‐up. Local recurrence was 16% in the PEI plus TACE group and 39.1% in the TACE group, resulting in an RR of 0.41 (95% CI 0.15 to 1.15; very low‐certainty evidence). Forty‐five out of a total of 68 tumours (66.2%) shrunk by at least 25% in the PEI plus TACE group versus 31 out of a total of 64 tumours (48.4%) in the TACE group. Trial authors reported some adverse events but provided very few details. We did not find data on time to mortality, failure to clear liver metastases, recurrence of liver metastases, health‐related quality of life, or time to progression of liver metastases. The single included trial did not provide information on funding nor on conflict of interest. Authors' conclusions Evidence for the effectiveness of PEI plus TACE versus TACE in people with liver metastases is of very low certainty and is based on one small randomised clinical trial at high risk of bias. Currently, it cannot be determined whether adding PEI to TACE makes a difference in comparison to using TACE alone. Evidence for benefits or harms of PEI compared with no intervention, other ablation methods, or systemic treatments is lacking. Plain language summary Percutaneous ethanol injection for liver metastases Is local destruction of the cancer that spread to the liver with percutaneous ethanol injection beneficial? Review question What is the effect of using percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) to destroy any cancer metastases in the liver? Metastases are new cancer sites that are found in parts of the body other than the site of the original cancer. We were looking for any randomised trial (a study in which patients are allocated to groups by a play of chance) assessing effects of PEI in people with metastases in the liver from cancer of any location compared with no PEI with or without co‐interventions. We looked at effects of PEI on risk of death, progression of disease, health‐related quality of life, and adverse events (unwanted effects caused by the intervention). Background When cancer spreads in the body (metastasis), one of the most common sites of metastasis is the liver. Besides cancers of the liver (primary liver cancer), liver metastases from colorectal cancer are the most common cancers affecting the liver. More than half of people who have cancer spread to the liver die of complications. Metastases in the liver can be destroyed by several different methods, one of them being PEI. This procedure is performed under ultrasound or computed tomography guidance; a special needle is placed at the cancer site and is subsequently used to inject alcohol with the goal of killing cancer tissues. Ultrasound and computed tomography are imaging procedures. Alcohol induces tumour destruction by drawing water out of tumour cells (dehydrating them), thereby altering (denaturing) the structure of the cellular proteins. Search results and study characteristics We last searched for evidence on 10 September 2019. We included only one randomised trial comparing percutaneous intratumour ethanol injection in combination with transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation (TACE; a liver‐directed treatment whereby chemotherapy is administered through the catheter directly to blood vessels supplying the tumour) to TACE alone. Forty‐eight people with liver metastases were included; 25 received PEI with TACE, and 23 received TACE alone. Primary tumours were colon, stomach, pancreas, lung, breast, and ovary cancers. The included study did not provide information on funding nor on conflict of interest. Key results Results of one small randomised clinical trial do not show beneficial or harmful effects of adding percutaneous intratumour ethanol injection to TACE in people with liver metastases with respect to mortality or local recurrence in comparison with TACE alone. Participants were followed for between 10 and 43 months. The tumour necrosis was larger in the combined treatment group. Trial authors reported some adverse events but gave very few details. We found no data on time to mortality, failure to clear liver metastases, recurrence of liver metastases, health‐related quality of life, or time to progression of liver metastases. Quality of evidence We judged the evidence to be of very low certainty because the identified study was at high risk of bias, had a relatively small sample size, described few events overall, and reported inconclusive results.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Treatment strategies for childhood cancer are improving, resulting in higher survival rates. However, the consequences of childhood cancer do not end with the successful completion of cancer treatment. Most patients will develop late effects after cessation of treatment. Severe fatigue is seen as a common and debilitating late effect in cancer survivors. Although most research on fatigue has been performed in patients after adult‐onset cancer, our review focuses on fatigue after childhood cancer. Objectives To estimate the prevalence of severe fatigue after treatment for childhood cancer. Secondary objectives are to describe the course of severe fatigue following cancer treatment and to examine risk factors for fatigue, or factors associated with it. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (the Cochrane Library 2019 ;  issue 8 March 2019), MEDLINE/PubMed (from 1945 to 8 March 2019), Embase/Ovid (from 1947 to 8 March 2019), reference lists of included articles and several conference proceedings from 2011 to 2018. Selection criteria Observational studies, randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trials reporting on fatigue in participants after treatment for childhood cancer. Case series and case reports were not eligible for inclusion. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risks of bias. If the publication did not present the prevalence of severe fatigue, we contacted study authors for additional information. Main results We included 30 studies (18,682 participants in total). Eighteen studies contributed to the main objective and 22 studies contributed to the secondary objectives. We found substantial differences between studies in cancer diagnosis, cancer treatment, age of participants, questionnaires used to assess fatigue, and sample size. All included studies scored at least one 'Risk of bias' item as unclear or high risk. We identified both clinical and statistical heterogeneity and therefore could not pool results, so we present them descriptively. Eighteen studies (describing 14,573 survivors) reported the prevalence of severe fatigue, which ranged from 0% to 61.7%. In a subgroup of three studies including children aged up to 18 years at fatigue assessment (268 survivors), prevalence rates ranged from 6.7% to 12.5%. In comparison, in a subgroup of 12 studies including participants aged 16 and over (13,952 survivors), prevalence rates ranged from 4.4% to 61.7%. The prevalence of severe fatigue in a subgroup of survivors of haematological cancer was presented in seven studies and ranged from 1.8% to 35.9% (1907 survivors). Prevalence of severe fatigue in brain cancer survivors was presented in two studies (252 survivors) and was 14.6% and 21.1% respectively. One study presented a prevalence for bone cancer survivors of 0.0% (17 survivors). Four studies provided prevalence rates of severe fatigue in control groups of siblings or population‐based controls, which ranged from 3.1% to 10.3%. In these four studies, survivors were more often fatigued than controls, but this difference was statistically significant in only two studies. Studies assessing risk and associated factors for fatigue were heterogeneous, and definitions of the factors under study were often inconsistent, with results therefore presented descriptively. They found that depression might be associated with fatigue. In contrast, age at diagnosis and education level did not seem to be associated with fatigue. We were unable to calculate any overall risk estimate for any of the reported risks and associated factors, because we could not conduct meta‐analysis. One study provided information about the course of fatigue over time, and found that over the course of 2.7 years, 32 of the 102 participants (31.4%) reported persistent severe fatigue. Authors' conclusions It is unclear how many childhood cancer survivors suffer from severe fatigue. This review encountered several difficulties. We found statistical and clinical heterogeneity and great variation in the reporting of possible risk and associated factors. The evidence in this review is therefore weak, and the exact prevalence of severe fatigue after treatment for childhood cancer remains to be determined. This is also the case for the course of severe fatigue following treatment and the strength of the relationship between fatigue and associated and risk factors. Despite these limitations, our review does provide a comprehensive overview of the existing literature about severe fatigue after treatment for childhood cancer. Plain language summary Severe fatigue after treatment for childhood cancer Review question We reviewed the literature to determine how common (prevalence) severe fatigue is in patients after treatment for childhood cancer. We also wanted to describe the course of severe fatigue after completion of cancer treatment, and to identify possible risk factors for the development of fatigue in this population. Background Treatments for childhood cancer are improving and becoming more effective in curing cancer. The impact of having had cancer at a young age, together with often intensive cancer therapy, can affect physical and mental well‐being later in life. Most survivors will develop one or more of these so‐called late effects. Severe fatigue is a common late effect in people with adult‐onset cancer and can affect a person's daily life in many ways. We do not currently know how often severe fatigue occurs after treatment for childhood cancer, nor which risk factors might be responsible for developing fatigue. Study characteristics The evidence is up to date to March 2019. We include 30 studies, describing 18,682 participants after treatment for childhood cancer. We found a lot of variation between studies in cancer diagnosis, cancer treatment, age of participants, the questionnaires used to assess fatigue, and the size of the study. Key results Eighteen studies reported a prevalence of severe fatigue, which ranged from 0% to 61.7%. Four studies reported a prevalence of severe fatigue in the patient's brothers and sisters or in population‐based controls. Prevalence rates in these control groups ranged from 3.1% to 10.3%. In these four studies, survivors were more often fatigued than controls. This difference was only significant in two studies. When we looked at the prevalence of severe fatigue in survivors of lymphoma and leukaemia (types of blood cancers), we found that they ranged from 1.8% to 35.9%. Two studies reported on severe fatigue in brain cancer survivors, with rates of 21.13% and 14.6%. One study in bone cancer survivors reported no cases of severe fatigue. For survivors aged 18 and younger, prevalence rates ranged from 6.7% to 12.5%. By contrast, in studies including participants aged 16 years and over (but mostly over 18), prevalence rates ranged from 4.4% to 61.7%. Twenty‐two studies assessed one or more possible risk factors for fatigue. Our review shows that depression might increase fatigue. The age at cancer diagnosis and the education level of the survivor did not seem to influence fatigue. Only one study provided information about the course of fatigue over time, and found that over the course of 2.7 years 32 of the 102 participants (31.4%) reported persistent severe fatigue. Quality of the evidence All included studies had problems with the quality of the evidence, and we found many differences between studies for several characteristics. The evidence to address our review question is therefore weak. The occurrence of severe fatigue after treatment for childhood cancer remains uncertain. This is also the case for the course of severe fatigue after completion of cancer treatment and the risk factors that might be responsible for developing fatigue.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background The liver is affected by two of the most common groups of malignant tumours: primary liver tumours and liver metastases from colorectal carcinoma. Liver metastases are significantly more common than primary liver cancer and long‐term survival rates reported for patients after radical surgical treatment is approximately 50%. However, R0 resection (resection for cure) is not feasible in the majority of patients. Cryotherapy is performed with the use of an image‐guided cryoprobe which delivers liquid nitrogen or argon gas to the tumour tissue. The subsequent process of freezing is associated with formation of ice crystals, which directly damage exposed tissue, including cancer cells. Objectives To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of cryotherapy compared with no intervention, other ablation methods, or systemic treatments in people with liver metastases. Search methods We searched The Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, and six other databases up to June 2018. Selection criteria Randomised clinical trials assessing beneficial and harmful effects of cryotherapy and its comparators for liver metastases, irrespective of the location of the primary tumour. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We extracted information on participant characteristics, interventions, study outcomes, and data on the outcomes important for our review, as well as information on the design and methodology of the trials. Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias in each study. One review author performed data extraction and a second review author checked entries. Main results We found no randomised clinical trials comparing cryotherapy versus no intervention or versus systemic treatments; however, we identified one randomised clinical trial comparing cryotherapy with conventional surgery. The trial was conducted in Ukraine. The trial included 123 participants with solitary, or multiple unilobar or bilobar liver metastases; 63 participants received cryotherapy and 60 received conventional surgery. There were 36 women and 87 men. The primary sites for the metastases were colon and rectum (66.6%), stomach (7.3%), breast (6.5%), skin (4.9%), ovaries (4.1%), uterus (3.3%), kidney (3.3%), intestines (1.6%), pancreas (1.6%), and unknown (0.8%). The trial was not reported sufficiently enough to assess the risk of bias of the randomisation process, allocation concealment, or presence of blinding. It was also not possible to assess incomplete outcome data and selective outcome reporting bias. The certainty of evidence was low because of risk of bias and imprecision. The participants were followed for up to 10 years (minimum five months). The trial reported that the mortality at 10 years was 81% (51/63) in the cryotherapy group and 92% (55/60) in the conventional surgery group. The calculated by us relative risk (RR) with 95% Confidence Interval (CI) was: RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.02. We judged the evidence as low‐certainty evidence. Regarding adverse events and complications, separately and in total, our calculation showed no evidence of a difference in recurrence of the malignancy in the liver: 86% (54/63) of the participants in the cryotherapy group and 95% (57/60) of the participants in the conventional surgery group developed a new malignancy (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.01; low‐certainty evidence). The frequency of reported complications was similar between the cryotherapy group and the conventional surgery group, except for postoperative pain. Both insignificant and pronounced pain were reported to be more common in the cryotherapy group while intense pain was reported to be more common in the conventional surgery group. However, the authors did not report whether there was any evidence of a difference. There were no intervention‐related mortality or bile leakages. We identified no evidence for health‐related quality of life, cancer mortality, or time to progression of liver metastases. The study reported tumour response in terms of the carcinoembryonic antigen level in 69% of participants, and reported results in the form of a graph for 30% of participants. The carcinoembryonic antigen level was lower in the cryotherapy group, and decreased to normal values faster in comparison with the control group (P < 0.05). Funding: the trial did not provide information on funding. Authors' conclusions The evidence for the effectiveness of cryotherapy versus conventional surgery in people with liver metastases is of low certainty. We are uncertain about our estimate and cannot determine whether cryotherapy compared with conventional surgery is beneficial or harmful. We found no evidence for the benefits or harms of cryotherapy compared with no intervention, or versus systemic treatments. Plain language summary Cryotherapy for liver metastases Review question Is cryotherapy (cooling) beneficial or harmful for local destruction of cancer (tumours) spread to the liver? Background When cancer spreads in the body (metastasis), one of the most common sites is the liver. Besides cancers of the liver (primary liver cancer), liver metastases from colorectal cancer are the most common cancer affecting the liver. More than half of people who have cancer spread to the liver die from complications. Cryotherapy is one of methods, used to destroy metastases in the liver. This method requires placing a special probe near the cancer site. The probe is used to deliver extreme cold to the site, which is produced by liquid nitrogen or argon gas. Placement of the probe can be guided using ultrasound or computed tomography (a special x‐ray). The rapid freezing process kills the cancer cells, and the size of the cancer is reduced. However, it is not clear if this treatment prolongs life or increases quality of life of affected people. We reviewed the evidence about the effect of cryotherapy in destroying cancer metastases in the liver. We searched for studies assessing the effect of cryotherapy in comparison with no treatment or any other treatment in people with liver metastases from cancer of any location. We aimed to assess the effect of cryotherapy on the risk of death, quality of life, and adverse events (side effects caused by the treatment). Study characteristics We last searched for evidence in June 2018. We included only one trial conducted in Ukraine, and participants' primary cancer was colorectal (bowel) cancer in 66% of instances, but there were also people with stomach, breast, skin, and other tumours. All of them had cancer spread to the liver. In this trial, 123 participants were allocated at random to receive either cryotherapy (63 people) or conventional surgery (affected parts of the liver were removed; 60 people). Funding The trial did not provide information on funding. Key results The trial was at high risk of bias. The participants were followed for up to 10 years (minimum five months). The trial reported that the mortality at 10 years was 81% (51/63) in the cryotherapy group and 92% (55/60) in the conventional surgery group. We judged the evidence as low‐certainty evidence. We found no evidence of a difference in proportion of participants with recurrence of the malignancy in the liver: 86% (54/63) of the participants in the cryotherapy group and 95% (57/60) of the participants in the conventional surgery group developed a new malignancy (low‐certainty evidence). The frequency of reported complications was similar between the cryotherapy group and the conventional surgery group, except for postoperative pain. Both insignificant and pronounced pain were reported to be more common in the cryotherapy group while intense pain was reported to be more common in the conventional surgery group. However, it was not reported whether there was any evidence of a difference. The frequency of unwanted effects (adverse events or complications) was mostly similar in both groups, but pain intensity and frequency seemed to differ between the groups. There were no intervention‐related mortality or bile leakages. The trial did not provide data on quality of life; cancer mortality, and time to progression of liver metastases. Reliability of the evidence The evidence for the effectiveness of cryotherapy versus conventional surgery in people with liver metastases is of low certainty. We are uncertain about our estimate and cannot determine whether cryotherapy compared with conventional surgery is beneficial or harmful. We found no evidence for the benefits or harms of cryotherapy compared with no intervention, or versus systemic treatments.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Fatigue is a common symptom in cancer patients receiving active treatment. There are a limited number of reviews evaluating interventions for fatigue  during  active treatment, and they are restricted to patients with advanced cancer, or to patients during radiotherapy. To date there is no systematic review on psychosocial interventions for fatigue during cancer treatment. Objectives To evaluate if psychosocial interventions are effective in reducing fatigue in cancer patients receiving active treatment for cancer, and which types of psychosocial interventions are the most effective. Search methods In September 2008 we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library ), PUBMED, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsycINFO, and checked the reference lists. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included which evaluated psychosocial interventions in adult cancer patients during treatment, with fatigue as an outcome measure. Data collection and analysis Three review authors independently extracted data from the selected studies, and assessed the methodological quality using several quality rating scales and additional criteria. Main results Twenty‐seven studies met the inclusion criteria with a total of 3324 participants, and seven studies reported significant effects of the psychosocial intervention on fatigue. In three studies the effect was maintained at follow‐up. The quality of the studies was generally moderate. Effect sizes varied between 0.17 to 1.07. The effectiveness of interventions specific for fatigue was significantly higher (80%) compared to interventions not specific for fatigue (14%). In five studies the interventions were specifically focused on fatigue, with four being effective. The five interventions were brief, consisting of three individual sessions, provided by (oncology) nurses. In general, during these interventions participants were educated about fatigue, were taught in self‐care or coping techniques, and learned activity management. Of the remaining 22 studies only three were effective in reducing fatigue, and these interventions had a more general approach. These interventions were aimed at psychological distress, mood and physical symptoms, and varied strongly in duration and content. Authors' conclusions There is limited evidence that psychosocial interventions during cancer treatment are effective in reducing fatigue. At present, psychosocial interventions specifically for fatigue are a promising type of intervention. However, there is no solid evidence for the effectiveness of interventions not specific for fatigue. Most aspects of the included studies were heterogeneous, and therefore it could not be established which other types of interventions, or elements were essential in reducing fatigue. Plain language summary The effect of psychosocial interventions on fatigue during cancer treatment in adults There is limited evidence that psychosocial interventions are effective in reducing fatigue during active treatment in cancer patients. Most promising are psychosocial interventions specifically designed to treat fatigue. In general, during these interventions patients were educated about fatigue, were taught in self‐care or coping techniques, and learned to manage their activity. Interventions that did not focus on fatigue were rarely effective in reducing fatigue.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background People with urothelial carcinoma of the bladder are at risk for recurrence and progression following transurethral resection of a bladder tumour (TURBT). Mitomycin C (MMC) and Bacillus Calmette‐Guérin (BCG) are commonly used, competing forms of intravesical therapy for intermediate‐ or high‐risk non‐muscle invasive (Ta and T1) urothelial bladder cancer but their relative merits are somewhat uncertain. Objectives To assess the effects of BCG intravesical therapy compared to MMC intravesical therapy for treating intermediate‐ and high‐risk Ta and T1 bladder cancer in adults. Search methods We performed a systematic literature search in multiple databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, LILACS), as well as in two clinical trial registries. We searched reference lists of relevant publications and abstract proceedings. We applied no language restrictions. The latest search was conducted in September 2019. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared intravesical BCG with intravesical MMC therapy for non‐muscle invasive urothelial bladder cancer. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened the literature, extracted data, assessed risk of bias and rated the quality of evidence according to GRADE per outcome. In the meta‐analyses, we used the random‐effects model. Main results We identified 12 RCTs comparing BCG versus MMC in participants with intermediate‐ and high‐risk non‐muscle invasive bladder tumours (published from 1995 to 2013). In total, 2932 participants were randomised. Time to death from any cause:  BCG may make little or no difference on time to death from any cause compared to MMC (hazard ratio (HR) 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79 to 1.20; participants = 1132, studies = 5; 567 participants in the BCG arm and 565 in the MMC arm; low‐certainty evidence). This corresponds to 6 fewer deaths (40 fewer to 36 more) per 1000 participants treated with BCG at five years. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence two levels due to study limitations and imprecision. Serious adverse effects:  12/577 participants treated with BCG experienced serious non‐fatal adverse effects compared to 4/447 participants in the MMC group. The pooled risk ratio (RR) is 2.31 (95% CI 0.82 to 6.52; participants = 1024, studies = 5; low‐certainty evidence). Therefore, BCG may increase the risk for serious adverse effects compared to MMC. This corresponds to nine more serious adverse effects (one fewer to 37 more) with BCG. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence two levels due to study limitations and imprecision. Time to recurrence:  BCG may reduce the time to recurrence compared to MMC (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.09; participants = 2616, studies = 11, 1273 participants in the BCG arm and 1343 in the MMC arm; low‐certainty evidence). This corresponds to 41 fewer recurrences (104 fewer to 29 more) with BCG at five years. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence two levels due to study limitations, imprecision and inconsistency. Time to progression:  BCG may make little or no difference on time to progression compared to MMC (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.26; participants = 1622, studies = 6; 804 participants in the BCG arm and 818 in the MMC arm; low‐certainty evidence). This corresponds to four fewer progressions (29 fewer to 27 more) with BCG at five years. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence two levels due to study limitations and imprecision. Quality of life:  we found very limited data for this outcomes and were unable to estimate an effect size. Authors' conclusions Based on our findings, BCG may reduce the risk of recurrence over time although the Confidence Intervals include the possibility of no difference. It may have no effect on either the risk of progression or risk of death from any cause over time. BCG may cause more serious adverse events although the Confidence Intervals once again include the possibility of no difference. We were unable to determine the impact on quality of life. The certainty of the evidence was consistently low, due to concerns that include possible selection bias, performance bias, given the lack of blinding in these studies, and imprecision. Plain language summary Bacillus Calmette‐Guérin or mitomycin C for treatment of non‐muscle‐invasive bladder cancer Review question In people with cancer of the inner lining of the bladder, how do two different medicines, that are called Bacillus Calmette‐Guérin (BCG) and mitomycin (MMC), that are put into the bladder, after the tumour is taken out, compare? Background Tumours of the superficial layers of the bladder, so‐called non‐muscle‐invasive bladder cancer, are treated by putting small instruments into the bladder and shaving them out. This works well but these tumours often come back. When they do come back they can be more aggressive and advanced than before. Different types of medicines put into the bladder afterwards can make that happen less often, with BCG and MMC being those used most often. We are not sure how the two treatments compare when it comes to wanted and unwanted effects. Study characteristics The content of this review is current to September 2019. We included only studies where chance determined what treatment people in the study would get. Key results We found 12 studies including 2932 people who matched our question. We found that BCG may lead to similar risk of dying from any cause over time (low‐quality evidence), but may increase the risk of serious unwanted effects (low‐quality evidence), although it is possible that it does not make a difference. BCG may reduce the risk that the tumour comes back over time (low‐quality evidence), although it is possible that it does not make a difference. BCG may have little or no effect on the risk that the tumour gets worse over time (low‐quality evidence). We found no data on quality of life. Quality of the evidence The quality of the evidence was consistently rated as low, meaning that our confidence is limited, and future research may change these findings.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Despite the development of new treatment options, the prognosis of high‐risk neuroblastoma patients is still poor; more than half of patients experience disease recurrence. High‐dose chemotherapy and haematopoietic stem cell rescue (i.e. myeloablative therapy) might improve survival. This review is the second update of a previously published Cochrane review. Objectives Primary objective To compare the efficacy, that is event‐free and overall survival, of high‐dose chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow or stem cell rescue with conventional therapy in children with high‐risk neuroblastoma. Secondary objectives To determine adverse effects (e.g. veno‐occlusive disease of the liver) and late effects (e.g. endocrine disorders or secondary malignancies) related to the procedure and possible effects of these procedures on quality of life. Search methods We searched the electronic databases The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library  2014, issue 11), MEDLINE/PubMed (1966 to December 2014) and EMBASE/Ovid (1980 to December 2014). In addition, we searched reference lists of relevant articles and the conference proceedings of the International Society for Paediatric Oncology (SIOP) (from 2002 to 2014), American Society for Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (ASPHO) (from 2002 to 2014), Advances in Neuroblastoma Research (ANR) (from 2002 to 2014) and American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO) (from 2008 to 2014). We searched for ongoing trials by scanning the ISRCTN register (www.isrct.com) and the National Institute of Health Register (www.clinicaltrials.gov). Both registers were screened in April 2015. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the efficacy of myeloablative therapy with conventional therapy in high‐risk neuroblastoma patients. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently performed study selection, data extraction and risk of bias assessment. If appropriate, we pooled studies. The risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated for dichotomous outcomes. For the assessment of survival data, we calculated the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% CI. We used Parmar's method if hazard ratios were not reported in the study. We used a random‐effects model. Main results We identified three RCTs including 739 children. They all used an age of one year as the cut‐off point for pre‐treatment risk stratification. The first updated search identified a manuscript reporting additional follow‐up data for one of these RCTs, while the second update identified an erratum of this study. There was a significant statistical difference in event‐free survival in favour of myeloablative therapy over conventional chemotherapy or no further treatment (three studies, 739 patients; HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.90). There was a significant statistical difference in overall survival in favour of myeloablative therapy over conventional chemotherapy or no further treatment (two studies, 360 patients; HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.98). However, when additional follow‐up data were included in the analyses the difference in event‐free survival remained statistically significant (three studies, 739 patients; HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.90), but the difference in overall survival was no longer statistically significant (two studies, 360 patients; HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.01). The meta‐analysis of secondary malignant disease and treatment‐related death did not show any significant statistical differences between the treatment groups. Data from one study (379 patients) showed a significantly higher incidence of renal effects, interstitial pneumonitis and veno‐occlusive disease in the myeloablative group compared to conventional chemotherapy, whereas for serious infections and sepsis no significant difference between the treatment groups was identified. No information on quality of life was reported. In the individual studies we evaluated different subgroups, but the results were not univocal in all studies. All studies had some methodological limitations. Authors' conclusions Based on the currently available evidence, myeloablative therapy seems to work in terms of event‐free survival. For overall survival there is currently no evidence of effect when additional follow‐up data are included. No definitive conclusions can be made regarding adverse effects and quality of life, although possible higher levels of adverse effects should be kept in mind. A definitive conclusion regarding the effect of myeloablative therapy in different subgroups is not possible. This systematic review only allows a conclusion on the concept of myeloablative therapy; no conclusions can be made regarding the best treatment strategy. Future trials on the use of myeloablative therapy for high‐risk neuroblastoma should focus on identifying the most optimal induction and/or myeloablative regimen. The best study design to answer these questions is a RCT. These RCTs should be performed in homogeneous study populations (e.g. stage of disease and patient age) and have a long‐term follow‐up. Different risk groups, using the most recent definitions, should be taken into account. It should be kept in mind that recently the age cut‐off for high risk disease was changed from one year to 18 months. As a result it is possible that patients with what is now classified as intermediate‐risk disease have been included in the high‐risk groups. Consequently the relevance of the results of these studies to the current practice can be questioned. Survival rates may be overestimated due to the inclusion of patients with intermediate‐risk disease. Plain language summary High‐dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplant compared to conventional therapy for children with high‐risk neuroblastoma Despite the development of new treatment options, the prognosis of high‐risk neuroblastoma patients still remains poor; in more than half of patients the disease returns. Stem cell rescue replaces blood‐forming stem cells that were destroyed by high‐dose chemotherapy in order to recover the bone marrow. It is also known as myeloablative therapy and might improve the survival of these patients. A well‐informed decision on the use of myeloablative therapy in the treatment of children with high‐risk neuroblastoma should be based on high quality evidence of effectiveness for treating tumours and side effects. This systematic review focused on randomised studies comparing the effectiveness of myeloablative therapy with conventional therapy in children with high‐risk neuroblastoma. The authors found three studies including 739 patients. These studies provide evidence that myeloablative therapy improves event‐free survival (that is, the time until a certain event, for example tumour progression, the development of a second tumour, or death from any cause occurs). For overall survival (that is, the time until a patient dies from any cause, so not only from the tumour or its treatment, but for example, also from a car accident) there is no evidence of a better outcome in patients treated with myeloablative therapy. Side effects such as renal (kidney) effects, interstitial pneumonitis (a type of lung disease) and veno‐occlusive disease (a condition in which some of the small veins in the liver are obstructed) were more common in patients treated with myeloablative therapy than conventional chemotherapy. It should be noted that this systematic review only allows a conclusion on the concept of myeloablative therapy; no conclusions regarding the best treatment strategy with regard to, for example, types of chemotherapeutic agents and the use of radiation therapy, could be made. More high quality research is needed. It should be noted that recently the age cut‐off for high‐risk disease was changed from one year to 18 months. As a result it is possible that patients with what is now classified as intermediate‐risk disease were included in the high‐risk groups. Consequently the relevance of the results of these studies to the current practice can be questioned. Survival rates may be overestimated due to the inclusion of patients with intermediate‐risk disease.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Melanoma is one of the most aggressive forms of skin cancer, with the potential to metastasise to other parts of the body via the lymphatic system and the bloodstream. Melanoma accounts for a small percentage of skin cancer cases but is responsible for the majority of skin cancer deaths. Various imaging tests can be used with the aim of detecting metastatic spread of disease following a primary diagnosis of melanoma (primary staging) or on clinical suspicion of disease recurrence (re‐staging). Accurate staging is crucial to ensuring that patients are directed to the most appropriate and effective treatment at different points on the clinical pathway. Establishing the comparative accuracy of ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET)‐CT imaging for detection of nodal or distant metastases, or both, is critical to understanding if, how, and where on the pathway these tests might be used. Objectives Primary objectives We estimated accuracy separately according to the point in the clinical pathway at which imaging tests were used. Our objectives were: • to determine the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound or PET‐CT for detection of  nodal metastases  before sentinel lymph node biopsy in adults with confirmed cutaneous invasive melanoma; and • to determine the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound, CT, MRI, or PET‐CT for whole body imaging in adults with cutaneous invasive melanoma: ○ for detection of  any metastasis in adults with a primary diagnosis  of melanoma (i.e. primary staging at presentation); and ○ for detection of  any metastasis in adults undergoing staging of recurrence  of melanoma (i.e. re‐staging prompted by findings on routine follow‐up). We undertook separate analyses according to whether accuracy data were reported per patient or per lesion. Secondary objectives We sought to determine the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound, CT, MRI, or PET‐CT for whole body imaging (detection of any metastasis) in mixed or not clearly described populations of adults with cutaneous invasive melanoma. For study participants undergoing primary staging or re‐staging (for possible recurrence), and for mixed or unclear populations, our objectives were: • to determine the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound, CT, MRI, or PET‐CT for detection of nodal metastases; • to determine the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound, CT, MRI, or PET‐CT for detection of distant metastases; and • to determine the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound, CT, MRI, or PET‐CT for detection of distant metastases according to metastatic site. Search methods We undertook a comprehensive search of the following databases from inception up to August 2016: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; MEDLINE; Embase; CINAHL; CPCI; Zetoc; Science Citation Index; US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register; NIHR Clinical Research Network Portfolio Database; and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We studied reference lists as well as published systematic review articles. Selection criteria We included studies of any design that evaluated ultrasound (with or without the use of fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC)), CT, MRI, or PET‐CT for staging of cutaneous melanoma in adults, compared with a reference standard of histological confirmation or imaging with clinical follow‐up of at least three months' duration. We excluded studies reporting multiple applications of the same test in more than 10% of study participants. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted all data using a standardised data extraction and quality assessment form (based on the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS‐2)). We estimated accuracy using the bivariate hierarchical method to produce summary sensitivities and specificities with 95% confidence and prediction regions. We undertook analysis of studies allowing direct and indirect comparison between tests. We examined heterogeneity between studies by visually inspecting the forest plots of sensitivity and specificity and summary receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plots. Numbers of identified studies were insufficient to allow formal investigation of potential sources of heterogeneity. Main results We included a total of 39 publications reporting on 5204 study participants; 34 studies reporting data per patient included 4980 study participants with 1265 cases of metastatic disease, and seven studies reporting data per lesion included 417 study participants with 1846 potentially metastatic lesions, 1061 of which were confirmed metastases. The risk of bias was low or unclear for all domains apart from participant flow. Concerns regarding applicability of the evidence were high or unclear for almost all domains. Participant selection from mixed or not clearly defined populations and poorly described application and interpretation of index tests were particularly problematic. The accuracy of imaging for detection of regional nodal metastases before sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was evaluated in 18 studies. In 11 studies (2614 participants; 542 cases), the summary sensitivity of ultrasound alone was 35.4% (95% confidence interval (CI) 17.0% to 59.4%) and specificity was 93.9% (95% CI 86.1% to 97.5%). Combining pre‐SLNB ultrasound with FNAC revealed summary sensitivity of 18.0% (95% CI 3.58% to 56.5%) and specificity of 99.8% (95% CI 99.1% to 99.9%) (1164 participants; 259 cases). Four studies demonstrated lower sensitivity (10.2%, 95% CI 4.31% to 22.3%) and specificity (96.5%,95% CI 87.1% to 99.1%) for PET‐CT before SLNB (170 participants, 49 cases). When these data are translated to a hypothetical cohort of 1000 people eligible for SLNB, 237 of whom have nodal metastases (median prevalence), the combination of ultrasound with FNAC potentially allows 43 people with nodal metastases to be triaged directly to adjuvant therapy rather than having SLNB first, at a cost of two people with false positive results (who are incorrectly managed). Those with a false negative ultrasound will be identified on subsequent SLNB. Limited test accuracy data were available for whole body imaging via PET‐CT for primary staging or re‐staging for disease recurrence, and none evaluated MRI. Twenty‐four studies evaluated whole body imaging. Six of these studies explored primary staging following a confirmed diagnosis of melanoma (492 participants), three evaluated re‐staging of disease following some clinical indication of recurrence (589 participants), and 15 included mixed or not clearly described population groups comprising participants at a number of different points on the clinical pathway and at varying stages of disease (1265 participants). Results for whole body imaging could not be translated to a hypothetical cohort of people due to paucity of data. Most of the studies (6/9) of primary disease or re‐staging of disease considered PET‐CT, two in comparison to CT alone, and three studies examined the use of ultrasound. No eligible evaluations of MRI in these groups were identified. All studies used histological reference standards combined with follow‐up, and two included FNAC for some participants. Observed accuracy for detection of any metastases for PET‐CT was higher for re‐staging of disease (summary sensitivity from two studies: 92.6%, 95% CI 85.3% to 96.4%; specificity: 89.7%, 95% CI 78.8% to 95.3%; 153 participants; 95 cases) compared to primary staging (sensitivities from individual studies ranged from 30% to 47% and specificities from 73% to 88%), and was more sensitive than CT alone in both population groups, but participant numbers were very small. No conclusions can be drawn regarding routine imaging of the brain via MRI or CT. Authors' conclusions Review authors found a disappointing lack of evidence on the accuracy of imaging in people with a diagnosis of melanoma at different points on the clinical pathway. Studies were small and often reported data according to the number of lesions rather than the number of study participants. Imaging with ultrasound combined with FNAC before SLNB may identify around one‐fifth of those with nodal disease, but confidence intervals are wide and further work is needed to establish cost‐effectiveness. Much of the evidence for whole body imaging for primary staging or re‐staging of disease is focused on PET‐CT, and comparative data with CT or MRI are lacking. Future studies should go beyond diagnostic accuracy and consider the effects of different imaging tests on disease management. The increasing availability of adjuvant therapies for people with melanoma at high risk of disease spread at presentation will have a considerable impact on imaging services, yet evidence for the relative diagnostic accuracy of available tests is limited. Plain language summary How good are ultrasound, CT, MRI, and PET‐CT for identifying spread of disease in the body among people with melanoma? What is the aim of the review? We wanted to find out which imaging tests are better for identifying spread of disease among people with a first diagnosis of melanoma (primary staging) and among people with possible recurrence of melanoma (re‐staging). We looked at the evidence for ultrasound, CT, MRI, and PET‐CT and included 39 studies to answer these questions. Why are imaging tests for melanoma important? Melanoma is one of the most aggressive forms of skin cancer, with potential for metastases (cancer cells) to spread to the lymph nodes and other organs of the body. To make sure that people with melanoma receive the most appropriate and effective treatment, it is important to identify whether the disease has spread and to which parts of the body it has spread. This is called 'staging of disease'. Staging is done to find out if a melanoma has spread to regional lymph nodes or to lymph nodes close to the original melanoma, and to determine if the melanoma has spread to lymph nodes in other parts of the body or to organs of the body such as the liver or the brain (distant metastases). Imaging tests are tools that can be used to help find out how much the disease has spread. Several new treatments are now available for reducing the risk of spread of melanoma and for treating melanoma when it has spread. What was studied in the review? The review includes four imaging tests that create images of the body in different ways. Ultrasound uses high‐frequency sound waves to create images, CT scans use ionising radiation in the form of X‐rays (a very low dose of radiation), and MRI uses large magnets and non‐ionising radiation in the form of radio waves (which are not harmful) to generate images of the body. PET‐CT requires injection of a weakly radioactive substance (FDG). The PET part of the scan identifies areas of the body that take up a lot of FDG (indicating possibly cancerous cells), and the CT part of the scan helps to improve image quality and to more accurately pinpoint areas using more FDG. Ultrasound can also be performed along with a fairly simple procedure called 'fine needle aspiration cytology' (FNAC), by which a very fine needle is used to take a small sample of cells from a lymph node that looks suspicious on ultrasound. A microscope is then used to identify whether or not the cells are malignant. Imaging can be used at different time points after diagnosis of melanoma. Healthcare providers can use imaging to look at the regional lymph nodes closest to the melanoma before a type of surgery called sentinel lymph node biopsy is performed. Sentinel lymph node biopsy takes out the lymph nodes that are most likely to have metastases inside them so they can be tested in a laboratory. Imaging can also be used after sentinel lymph node biopsy or in people with higher‐risk melanoma to look for any spread of disease. Imaging can be used in people who were treated for melanoma at an earlier point and who might be having a recurrence of their disease. What are the main results of the review? Ultrasound of regional lymph nodes before sentinel lymph node biopsy We found 11 relevant studies including 2614 people. Three of these studies compared ultrasound on its own to ultrasound combined with FNAC. Results suggest that the combined procedure correctly identifies around one‐fifth of people with metastases in the lymph nodes with very few false positive results (people with incorrect diagnosis of metastasis). These results can be illustrated by imagining a group of 1000 people with melanoma who are going to have sentinel lymph node biopsy, of whom 237 (24%) have metastases in the lymph nodes. The combination of ultrasound with FNAC potentially allows 43 people with lymph node metastases to be identified and avoid a sentinel lymph node biopsy, at a cost of two people with false positive results who might go on to have the wrong treatment. Those with metastases in the lymph nodes that are missed on ultrasound (false negatives) will be identified on subsequent SLNB. Whole body imaging (detection of any metastases) We found 24 studies, but only nine were clear about the point in the time course of disease that imaging was carried out. Six studies including 492 people looked at imaging for primary staging following a confirmed diagnosis of melanoma, and three studies in 589 people evaluated re‐staging of disease in people with possible recurrence of disease. Most of the studies (6/9) considered PET‐CT, two in comparison to CT alone, and three studies examined the use of ultrasound. We did not find any suitable studies of MRI in these groups. Overall results suggest that PET‐CT is better for correctly identifying people with metastatic spread of disease who might be having a recurrence of disease (re‐staging) than people who have a new diagnosis of melanoma (primary staging). PET‐CT also seems to be better than CT for identifying spread of disease in both groups of people, but studies were very small and results might not be reliable. How reliable are the results of the studies included in this review? In most of our studies, a reliable diagnosis of spread of disease (or reference standard) was made by performing biopsy and by following up with people over time using clinical assessment and imaging. There was often a lack of detail on how patients were followed up and which tests were used. Lots of studies did not include people at clearly defined time points in the disease process, making it difficult to assess the relevance of their results. Reporting of application and interpretation of tests was poor. To whom do the results of this review apply? Thirty‐three studies were done in Europe (85%), and the rest in North America (n = 4), Asia (n = 1), or Oceania (n = 1). The average age of people in the studies was between 50 and 67 years, and around half were men. Studies mostly included people with melanoma on any part of the body, but two included only people with melanoma on the head or neck. Studies often included people at different stages of disease, and we were not able to look at the accuracy of tests for people at any particular disease stage. Studies were small, and their results might not match what happens in real life. What are the implications of this review? Reviewers found some evidence to support the use of imaging with ultrasound combined with FNAC before sentinel lymph node biopsy, but further work is needed to establish cost‐effectiveness. Limited evidence is available for whole body imaging for primary staging or re‐staging of disease. Available evidence is focused on PET‐CT; there are few comparisons with CT and no comparisons with MRI. Future research needs to look at more than test accuracy and must consider the effects of different imaging tests on treatment decisions for patients. How up‐to‐date is this review? The reviewers searched for and included studies published up to August 2016.* *In these studies, biopsy and clinical or imaging follow‐up were the reference standards (methods of establishing the final diagnosis).},

abstract = {Abstract - Background The use of systemic immunotherapy targets is emerging as an important treatment option for metastatic urothelial carcinoma, particularly for patients who cannot tolerate or who fail cisplatin‐based chemotherapy. One such target is the inhibition of the checkpoint protein programmed cell death‐1 (PD‐1) receptor and its ligand (PD‐L1) by monoclonal antibodies. Objectives To assess the effects of pembrolizumab monotherapy versus chemotherapy for treatment of advanced urothelial carcinoma with disease progression during or following platinum‐containing chemotherapy. Search methods We performed a Cochrane Rapid Review, limiting our search to published studies in the English language. We searched databases of the medical literature, including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and MEDLINE, as well as trial registries including ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP). Our search extended from January 2000 to June 2018. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials except cross‐over trials and cluster randomised trials. We excluded all other study designs. Participants included had locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma of the bladder, with disease progression during or following platinum‐containing chemotherapy (synonymous with second‐/third‐/fourth‐line therapy). This review focused on pembrolizumab (synonyms: MK‐3475, lambrolizumab, Keytruda). Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently classified and abstracted data from the included study. The certainty of evidence was rated according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Main results We identified one randomised controlled trial that included 542 participants, which compared the use of pembrolizumab monotherapy versus chemotherapy for the treatment of advanced urothelial carcinoma with disease progression during or following platinum‐containing chemotherapy. Results were reported after a median follow‐up of 14.1 months (range 9.9 to 22.1 months). Primary outcomes Pembrolizumab probably reduces the risk of death from any cause (hazard ratio (HR) 0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 0.90; moderate certainty evidence). This corresponds to 115 fewer deaths (191 fewer to 38 fewer) per 1000 participants with pembrolizumab at 12 months. We downgraded the certainty of evidence one level for imprecision. Pembrolizumab may slightly improve quality of life (change from baseline to week 15 assessed with the Core Quality of Life Questionnaire; higher value reflects better quality of life; scale 0 to 100) with a mean difference (MD) of 9.05, 95% CI 4.61 to 13.50; low certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of evidence two levels for study limitations and imprecision. Secondary outcomes Pembrolizumab may have little or no effect on disease progression (HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.19; low certainty evidence). This corresponds to three fewer patients (42 fewer to 24 more) whose disease progressed per 1000 participants at 12 months. We downgraded the certainty of evidence two levels for study limitations and imprecision. Pembrolizumab probably improves treatment response (based on complete or partial radiologic response) with a risk ratio (RR) of 1.85, 95% CI 1.24 to 2.77; moderate certainty evidence). This corresponds to 97 more respondents (27 more to 202 more) per 1000 participants with pembrolizumab. We downgraded the certainty of evidence one level for imprecision. Pembrolizumab may have little or no effect on treatment‐related mortality (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.24 to 3.79; low certainty evidence). This corresponds to one fewer (12 fewer to 44 more) treatment‐related deaths per 1000 participants with pembrolizumab. We downgraded the certainty of evidence two levels for study limitations and imprecision. Pembrolizumab may have little or no effect on discontinuations due to adverse events (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.10). This corresponds to 54 fewer discontinuations per 1000 participants (95% CI 79 fewer to 7 more). We downgraded the certainty of evidence for study limitations and imprecision. Pembrolizumab may reduce serious adverse events (RR 0.83, 95 CI 0.72 to 0.97; low certainty evidence). This corresponds to 107 fewer serious averse events per 1000 participants (95% CI 19 fewer to 176 fewer). We downgraded two levels for study limitations and imprecision. Authors' conclusions The use of pembrolizumab in men with advanced urothelial carcinoma with disease progression during or following platinum‐containing chemotherapy probably improves overall survival when compared with chemotherapy alone. At 12 months follow‐up about 70% of those in the chemotherapy group had died, compared with 59% of those treated with pembrolizumab. We are very uncertain about the effects of pembolizumab on quality of life. Pembolizumab may also improve treatment response rates, and reduce the risk of serious adverse events, but may make little or no difference to discontinuations of treatment due to adverse events. These conclusions are based on a single trial that was sponsored by the producer of pembrolizumab. Plain language summary Pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy for treating advanced bladder cancer after recurrence/progression following platinum‐based chemotherapy Review question How does pembrolizumab (a newer medicine that works through the body's immune system) compare to chemotherapy in patients with cancer of the inner lining of the urinary system, called urothelial cancer, that has either come back or worsened after treatment? Background Medications that target the body's immune system have been used for a long time to treat urothelial cancer. When the cancer has spread to other organs outside the urinary tract, patients are often treated with chemotherapy using medicines called cisplatin or carboplatin (platinum‐containing chemotherapy). However, often the cancer comes back or becomes worse despite treatment. This review considers the evidence for pembrolizumab, which is a member of a new class of medications that work through the immune sytem, and compares it to chemotherapy. Study characteristics We considered only randomised controlled trials in this Cochrane Rapid Review, as they offer the most reliable results. This review is current to 20 June 2018. Key results We found only one randomised study for our question. Participants included in this trial had metastatic (cancer that has spread to other parts of the body) or advanced cancer that could not be removed by surgery, that had come back or worsened with other chemotherapy. We found that pembrolizumab probably improves overall survival a little (evidence of moderate certainty). It may improve quality of life slightly (low certainty evidence). Pembrolizumab may have little or not effect on the time for the cancer to worsen or advance (low certainty evidence). It probably improves treatment response as seen on X‐ray scans such as computer tomography (moderate certainty of evidence). Pembrolizumab may have little or no effect on deaths resulting from the treatment itself (low certainty evidence) but may result in fewer patients stopping treatment due to unwanted side effects (low certainty evidence). It may also cause less serious side effects. These conclusions are based on a single trial paid for by the company that makes pembrolizumab. Certainty of evidence The certainty of evidence ranged from moderate to very low.},

ISSN = {1465-1858},
abstract = {Abstract - Background Mycosis fungoides (MF) is the most common type of cutaneous T‐cell lymphoma, a malignant, chronic disease initially affecting the skin. Several therapies are available, which may induce clinical remission for a time. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2012: we wanted to assess new trials, some of which investigated new interventions. Objectives To assess the effects of interventions for MF in all stages of the disease. Search methods We updated our searches of the following databases to May 2019: the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We searched 2 trials registries for additional references. For adverse event outcomes, we undertook separate searches in MEDLINE in April, July and November 2017. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of local or systemic interventions for MF in adults with any stage of the disease compared with either another local or systemic intervention or with placebo. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. The primary outcomes were improvement in health‐related quality of life as defined by participants, and common adverse effects of the treatments. Key secondary outcomes were complete response (CR), defined as complete disappearance of all clinical evidence of disease, and objective response rate (ORR), defined as proportion of patients with a partial or complete response. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence and considered comparisons of psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) light treatment as most important because this is first‐line treatment for MF in most guidelines. Main results This review includes 20 RCTs (1369 participants) covering a wide range of interventions. The following were assessed as either treatments or comparators: imiquimod, peldesine, hypericin, mechlorethamine, nitrogen mustard and intralesional injections of interferon‐α (IFN‐α) (topical applications); PUVA, extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP: photochemotherapy), and visible light (light applications); acitretin, bexarotene, lenalidomide, methotrexate and vorinostat (oral agents); brentuximab vedotin; denileukin diftitox; mogamulizumab; chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, etoposide, and vincristine; a combination of chemotherapy with electron beam radiation; subcutaneous injection of IFN‐α; and intramuscular injections of active transfer factor (parenteral systemics). Thirteen trials used an active comparator, five were placebo‐controlled, and two compared an active operator to observation only. In 14 trials, participants had MF in clinical stages IA to IIB. All participants were treated in secondary and tertiary care settings, mainly in Europe, North America or Australia. Trials recruited both men and women, with more male participants overall. Trial duration varied from four weeks to 12 months, with one longer‐term study lasting more than six years. We judged 16 trials as at high risk of bias in at least one domain, most commonly performance bias (blinding of participants and investigators), attrition bias and reporting bias. None of our key comparisons measured quality of life, and the two studies that did presented no usable data. Eighteen studies reported common adverse effects of the treatments. Adverse effects ranged from mild symptoms to lethal complications depending upon the treatment type. More aggressive treatments like systemic chemotherapy generally resulted in more severe adverse effects. In the included studies, CR rates ranged from 0% to 83% (median 31%), and ORR ranged from 0% to 88% (median 47%). Five trials assessed PUVA treatment, alone or combined, summarised below. There may be little to no difference between intralesional IFN‐α and PUVA compared with PUVA alone for 24 to 52 weeks in CR (risk ratio (RR) 1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87 to 1.31; 2 trials; 122 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Common adverse events and ORR were not measured. One small cross‐over trial found once‐monthly ECP for six months may be less effective than twice‐weekly PUVA for three months, reporting CR in two of eight participants and ORR in six of eight participants after PUVA, compared with no CR or ORR after ECP (very low‐certainty evidence). Some participants reported mild nausea after PUVA but no numerical data were given. One participant in the ECP group withdrew due to hypotension. However, we are unsure of the results due to very low‐certainty evidence. One trial comparing bexarotene plus PUVA versus PUVA alone for up to 16 weeks reported one case of photosensitivity in the bexarotene plus PUVA group compared to none in the PUVA‐alone group (87 participants; low‐certainty evidence). There may be little to no difference between bexarotene plus PUVA and PUVA alone in CR (RR 1.41, 95% CI 0.71 to 2.80) and ORR (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.44) (93 participants; low‐certainty evidence). One trial comparing subcutaneous IFN‐α injections combined with either acitretin or PUVA for up to 48 weeks or until CR indicated there may be little to no difference in the common IFN‐α adverse effect of flu‐like symptoms (RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.88; 82 participants). There may be lower CR with IFN‐α and acitretin compared with IFN‐α and PUVA (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.84; 82 participants) (both outcomes: low‐certainty evidence). This trial did not measure ORR. One trial comparing PUVA maintenance treatment to no maintenance treatment, in participants who had already had CR, did report common adverse effects. However, the distribution was not evaluable. CR and OR were not assessable. The range of treatment options meant that rare adverse effects consequently occurred in a variety of organs. Authors' conclusions ​ ​There is a lack of high‐certainty evidence to support decision making in the treatment of MF. Because of substantial heterogeneity in design, missing data, small sample sizes, and low methodological quality, the comparative safety and efficacy of these interventions cannot be reliably established on the basis of the included RCTs. PUVA is commonly recommended as first‐line treatment for MF, and we did not find evidence to challenge this recommendation. There was an absence of evidence to support the use of intralesional IFN‐α or bexarotene in people receiving PUVA and an absence of evidence to support the use of acitretin or ECP for treating MF. Future trials should compare the safety and efficacy of treatments to PUVA, as the current standard of care, and should measure quality of life and common adverse effects. Plain language summary Treatments for mycosis fungoides (a malignant cancerous condition of immune cells in the blood that affects the skin) What was the aim of this review? This Cochrane Review compared treatments for mycosis fungoides (also called cutaneous T‐cell lymphoma, Alibert‐Bazin syndrome or granuloma fungoides). What was studied in the review? Mycosis fungoides (MF) typically starts as flat and scaly pink or red areas (patches) on the torso, upper thighs or buttocks. At this stage, life expectancy is unaffected. As the disease develops, life expectancy reduces. Patches can turn into raised, itchy plaques. Plaques can become thicker, deeper, and develop into tumours. In rare cases, the disease spreads to other organs. Many treatments exist for MF; these target specific body areas (local therapy) or the entire body (systemic therapy). Treatments include creams, ointments, oral or injected medicines, light therapy, radiotherapy (radiation that kills cancer cells) and chemotherapy (medicines that kill cancer cells). We compared the benefits and harms of different treatments in adults, at different disease stages. We identified 20 studies published up to May 2019. The studies included 1369, mainly male, adults. Most ran from 4 weeks to 12 months. Only five studies investigated the later stages of disease. All were set in specialised healthcare centres in Europe (12 studies), North America (11 studies), Australia (three studies), Brazil and Japan (one study each; satellite centres for studies already listed). Treatments were compared with another treatment (13 studies); an inactive treatment (placebo) (five studies); or no treatment (two studies). Five studies did not report their funding. Eleven studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies and four by academic institutions or hospitals. Key results We do not know how different treatments for MF affect quality of life. Very few studies assessed this outcome and they presented no usable data. Unwanted (adverse) effects ranged from mild symptoms to severe life‐threatening complications. More aggressive treatments (such as chemotherapy) generally caused more severe adverse effects. PUVA (a light treatment) is the first treatment used for MF. Results from five studies provided low‐certainty evidence: There may be little to no difference between giving PUVA alone and PUVA plus injected interferon‐α (IFN‐ α) (a messenger substance of the immune system) for 24 to 52 weeks for making the disease disappear completely. No studies investigated adverse events in these treatments or disappearance of at least 50% of the disease. There may be little to no difference between an oral vitamin A derivative (bexarotene) plus PUVA, and PUVA alone, for complete or at least 50% disease disappearance (treatment duration: up to 16 weeks). Extreme sensitivity to ultraviolet (UV) rays occurred in some people who received bexarotene and PUVA, but not PUVA alone. There may be little to no difference between IFN‐ α plus PUVA and IFN‐α plus acitretin (another oral vitamin A derivative) on flu‐like symptoms, when treatment is given for up to 48 weeks or until complete disease disappearance. However, there may be a lower rate of complete disease disappearance with IFN‐α plus acitretin. No studies investigated the effect on partial disappearance. It is not clear how PUVA maintenance treatment (to prevent the disease from reappearing after it has disappeared) compares with no maintenance treatment, since the only study on this reported very limited information. One small trial (eight people) compared extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP, a light therapy) once monthly for six months with twice‐weekly PUVA for three months. It reported complete or at least 50% disappearance of MF in some participants treated with PUVA and none who received ECP. Common side effects were reported with each treatment (PUVA may be associated with mild nausea, and ECP with hypotension). However, the very‐low certainty evidence means we are not sure of these results. How confident are we in the results of this review? Our confidence in the results of this review is mainly low, but very low for one set of key results. The review is based on small and poorly designed studies. Further research is likely to change its message. Conclusion We found no evidence to challenge or support the standard treatment (PUVA). In the absence of a cure, treatment of MF should be based on disease stage, with a focus on limiting severe adverse effects.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is one of the most common haematological malignancies in young adults and, with cure rates of 90%, has become curable for the majority of individuals. Positron emission tomography (PET) is an imaging tool used to monitor a tumour’s metabolic activity, stage and progression. Interim PET during chemotherapy has been posited as a prognostic factor in individuals with HL to distinguish between those with a poor prognosis and those with a better prognosis. This distinction is important to inform decision‐making on the clinical pathway of individuals with HL. Objectives To determine whether in previously untreated adults with HL receiving first‐line therapy, interim PET scan results can distinguish between those with a poor prognosis and those with a better prognosis, and thereby predict survival outcomes in each group. Search methods We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL and conference proceedings up until April 2019. We also searched one trial registry ( ClinicalTrials.gov ). Selection criteria We included retrospective and prospective studies evaluating interim PET scans in a minimum of 10 individuals with HL (all stages) undergoing first‐line therapy. Interim PET was defined as conducted during therapy (after one, two, three or four treatment cycles). The minimum follow‐up period was at least 12 months. We excluded studies if the trial design allowed treatment modification based on the interim PET scan results. Data collection and analysis We developed a data extraction form according to the Checklist for Critical Appraisal and Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews of Prediction Modelling Studies (CHARMS). Two teams of two review authors independently screened the studies, extracted data on overall survival (OS), progression‐free survival (PFS) and PET‐associated adverse events (AEs), assessed risk of bias (per outcome) according to the Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool, and assessed the certainty of the evidence (GRADE). We contacted investigators to obtain missing information and data. Main results Our literature search yielded 11,277 results. In total, we included 23 studies (99 references) with 7335 newly‐diagnosed individuals with classic HL (all stages). Participants in 16 studies underwent (interim) PET combined with computed tomography (PET‐CT), compared to PET only in the remaining seven studies. The standard chemotherapy regimen included ABVD (16) studies, compared to BEACOPP or other regimens (seven studies). Most studies (N = 21) conducted interim PET scans after two cycles (PET2) of chemotherapy, although PET1, PET3 and PET4 were also reported in some studies. In the meta‐analyses, we used PET2 data if available as we wanted to ensure homogeneity between studies. In most studies interim PET scan results were evaluated according to the Deauville 5‐point scale (N = 12). Eight studies were not included in meta‐analyses due to missing information and/or data; results were reported narratively. For the remaining studies, we pooled the unadjusted hazard ratio (HR). The timing of the outcome measurement was after two or three years (the median follow‐up time ranged from 22 to 65 months) in the pooled studies. Eight studies explored the independent prognostic ability of interim PET by adjusting for other established prognostic factors (e.g. disease stage, B symptoms). We did not pool the results because the multivariable analyses adjusted for a different set of factors in each study. Overall survival Twelve (out of 23) studies reported OS. Six of these were assessed as low risk of bias in all of the first four domains of QUIPS (study participation, study attrition, prognostic factor measurement and outcome measurement). The other six studies were assessed as unclear, moderate or high risk of bias in at least one of these four domains. Four studies were assessed as low risk, and eight studies as high risk of bias for the domain other prognostic factors (covariates). Nine studies were assessed as low risk, and three studies as high risk of bias for the domain 'statistical analysis and reporting'. We pooled nine studies with 1802 participants. Participants with HL who have a negative interim PET scan result probably have a large advantage in OS compared to those with a positive interim PET scan result (unadjusted HR 5.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.64 to 9.81, I² = 44%, moderate‐certainty evidence). In absolute values, this means that 900 out of 1000 participants with a negative interim PET scan result will probably survive longer than three years compared to 585 (95% CI 356 to 757) out of 1000 participants with a positive result. Adjusted results from two studies also indicate an independent prognostic value of interim PET scan results (moderate‐certainty evidence). Progression‐free survival Twenty‐one studies reported PFS. Eleven out of 21 were assessed as low risk of bias in the first four domains. The remaining were assessed as unclear, moderate or high risk of bias in at least one of the four domains. Eleven studies were assessed as low risk, and ten studies as high risk of bias for the domain other prognostic factors (covariates). Eight studies were assessed as high risk, thirteen as low risk of bias for statistical analysis and reporting. We pooled 14 studies with 2079 participants. Participants who have a negative interim PET scan result may have an advantage in PFS compared to those with a positive interim PET scan result, but the evidence is very uncertain (unadjusted HR 4.90, 95% CI 3.47 to 6.90, I² = 45%, very low‐certainty evidence). This means that 850 out of 1000 participants with a negative interim PET scan result may be progression‐free longer than three years compared to 451 (95% CI 326 to 569) out of 1000 participants with a positive result. Adjusted results (not pooled) from eight studies also indicate that there may be an independent prognostic value of interim PET scan results (low‐certainty evidence). PET‐associated adverse events No study measured PET‐associated AEs. Authors' conclusions This review provides moderate‐certainty evidence that interim PET scan results predict OS, and very low‐certainty evidence that interim PET scan results predict progression‐free survival in treated individuals with HL. This evidence is primarily based on unadjusted data. More studies are needed to test the adjusted prognostic ability of interim PET against established prognostic factors. Plain language summary Imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) during chemotherapy to predict outcome in adults with Hodgkin lymphoma Review question This Cochrane Review aimed to find out whether the results of a positron emission tomography (PET) during therapy in people with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) can help to distinguish between those with a poor prognosis and those with a better prognosis, and predict survival outcomes in each group. Background Hodgkin lymphoma is a cancer which affects the lymphoid system of the body. It is considered a relatively rare disease (two to three cases per 100,000 people every year in Western countries), that is most common in young adults in their twenties, but it can also occur in children and elderly people. As treatment options have improved, most people with HL can now be cured. It is important that individuals receive the treatment with the greatest efficacy and least toxicity possible. PET is an imaging tool for assessing the disease stage of an individual, and monitoring tumour activity. It has been suggested that PET performed during therapy (so‐called interim PET, e.g. after two cycles of chemotherapy) can distinguish between people who respond well to therapy and those who do not respond well. The aim of this review was to demonstrate the prognostic ability to distinguish between these groups, and predict survival outcomes in each group, to help clinicians make an informed decision on the treatment pathway to improve long‐term outcomes and safety for people with HL. Study characteristics We included 23 studies to explore the association between interim PET scan results after one to four cycles of chemotherapy and survival outcomes in adults with HL (all stages). We contacted 10 authors, and six provided us with relevant information and/or data. Key results In 16 included studies, participants received either ABVD chemotherapy or BEACOPP chemotherapy (four studies) only, with or without radiotherapy. In 16 studies, participants underwent an interim PET scan in combination with a computed tomography (CT) (PET‐CT), which have higher accuracy in detecting primary and secondary cancers than a PET scan alone. In the remaining seven studies, PET‐only was conducted. Twenty‐one studies conducted interim PET scans after two cycles (PET2) of chemotherapy. Eight studies did not report enough data on our outcomes or population of interest, so we reported the results from these studies narratively. We combined individual study results in meta‐analyses to provide robust evidence for our outcomes of interest overall survival and progression‐free survival. No study measured PET‐associated adverse events (harms). For overall survival, combined results from nine studies (1802 participants) show that there is probably a large advantage in overall survival for people with a negative interim PET scan compared to people with a positive interim PET scan. For progression‐free survival, combined results from 14 studies (2079 participants) show that interim PET‐negative people may have an advantage for progression‐free survival, compared to interim PET‐positive people, but we are uncertain about this result. These are unadjusted results, where interim PET was tested as the only prognostic factor. Eight studies reported adjusted results, where the independent prognostic ability of interim PET was assessed against other established prognostic factors (e.g. disease stage, B symptoms). We could not combine individual study results because the studies did not include identical sets of covariates. Nevertheless, their results indicate a probable independent prognostic ability of interim PET to predict both outcomes. Certainty of the evidence Regarding the unadjusted results, we rated our certainty of the evidence as 'moderate' for overall survival. This means that the true effect is likely to be close to the estimated effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different. For progression‐free survival, we rated our certainty of the evidence as 'very low', meaning that we have little confidence in the effect estimate, and that the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimated effect. Regarding the adjusted results, we rated our certainty of the evidence as 'moderate' for overall survival, and 'low' for progression‐free survival. How up‐to‐date is this review? We searched data bases up until 2 April 2019, and one trial registry on 25 January 2019.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a highly lethal disease with few effective treatment options. Over the past few decades, many anti‐cancer therapies have been tested in the locally advanced and metastatic setting, with mixed results. This review attempts to synthesise all the randomised data available to help better inform patient and clinician decision‐making when dealing with this difficult disease. Objectives To assess the effect of chemotherapy, radiotherapy or both for first‐line treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer. Our primary outcome was overall survival, while secondary outcomes include progression‐free survival, grade 3/4 adverse events, therapy response and quality of life. Search methods We searched for published and unpublished studies in CENTRAL (searched 14 June 2017), Embase (1980 to 14 June 2017), MEDLINE (1946 to 14 June 2017) and CANCERLIT (1999 to 2002) databases. We also handsearched all relevant conference abstracts published up until 14 June 2017. Selection criteria All randomised studies assessing overall survival outcomes in patients with advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy, alone or in combination, were the eligible treatments. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently analysed studies, and a third settled any disputes. We extracted data on overall survival (OS), progression‐free survival (PFS), response rates, adverse events (AEs) and quality of life (QoL), and we assessed risk of bias for each study. Main results We included 42 studies addressing chemotherapy in 9463 patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. We did not identify any eligible studies on radiotherapy. We did not find any benefit for chemotherapy over best supportive care. However, two identified studies did not have sufficient data to be included in the analysis, and many of the chemotherapy regimens studied were outdated. Compared to gemcitabine alone, participants receiving 5FU had worse OS (HR 1.69, 95% CI 1.26 to 2.27, moderate‐quality evidence), PFS (HR 1.47, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.92) and QoL. On the other hand, two studies showed FOLFIRINOX was better than gemcitabine for OS (HR 0.51 95% CI 0.43 to 0.60, moderate‐quality evidence), PFS (HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.57) and response rates (RR 3.38, 95% CI 2.01 to 5.65), but it increased the rate of side effects. The studies evaluating CO‐101, ZD9331 and exatecan did not show benefit or harm when compared with gemcitabine alone. Giving gemcitabine at a fixed dose rate improved OS (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.94, high‐quality evidence) but increased the rate of side effects when compared with bolus dosing. When comparing gemcitabine combinations to gemcitabine alone, gemcitabine plus platinum improved PFS (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.95) and response rates (RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.98) but not OS (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.08, low‐quality evidence). The rate of side effects increased. Gemcitabine plus fluoropyrimidine improved OS (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.95), PFS (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.87) and response rates (RR 1.78, 95% CI 1.29 to 2.47, high‐quality evidence), but it also increased side effects. Gemcitabine plus topoisomerase inhibitor did not improve survival outcomes but did increase toxicity. One study demonstrated that gemcitabine plus nab‐paclitaxel improved OS (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.84, high‐quality evidence), PFS (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.82) and response rates (RR 3.29, 95% CI 2.24 to 4.84) but increased side effects. Gemcitabine‐containing multi‐drug combinations (GEMOXEL or cisplatin/epirubicin/5FU/gemcitabine) improved OS (HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.79, low‐quality evidence), PFS (HR 0.43, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.62) and QOL. We did not find any survival advantages when comparing 5FU combinations to 5FU alone. Authors' conclusions Combination chemotherapy has recently overtaken the long‐standing gemcitabine as the standard of care. FOLFIRINOX and gemcitabine plus nab‐paclitaxel are highly efficacious, but our analysis shows that other combination regimens also offer a benefit. Selection of the most appropriate chemotherapy for individual patients still remains difficult, with clinicopathological stratification remaining elusive. Biomarker development is essential to help rationalise treatment selection for patients. Plain language summary The effects of anti‐cancer therapies on advanced pancreatic cancer Review question This review aimed to answer the question, which therapies are the most effective for advanced pancreatic cancer? Background Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a serious, often fatal disease, and many people are not diagnosed until they have advanced tumours that cannot be removed with surgery. Symptoms include abdominal pain, weight loss, and yellowing of the skin and eyes. Up until recently, gemcitabine was the standard drug for treating advanced pancreatic cancer, but this gave people only a modest benefit. Study characteristics We looked for all studies in people with pancreatic cancer that could not be operated on (locally advanced) or that had already spread beyond the pancreas (metastatic). We found 42 clinical studies involving 9463 participants who were receiving their first therapy for PC. Our search is current to June 2017. The studies compared one therapy against either best supportive care (symptom management only) or another type of therapy. Studies had to evaluate overall survival (or time to death). The study could be testing either chemotherapy (drugs that kill or slow the growth of cancer cells) or radiotherapy (X‐ray treatment). We collected data on survival, tumour response rate, side effects and quality of life. The results of clinical studies addressing targeted/biological therapies, immunotherapies, second‐line therapies and local treatments for locally advanced disease will be reported in a separate Cochrane Review. Key results This review has shown that in advanced disease, combination chemotherapy with FOLFIRINOX (5‐fluorouracil, irinotecan, oxaliplatin combination); GEMOXEL (gemcitabine, oxaliplatin and capecitabine); cisplatin/epirubicin/5FU/gemcitabine; gemcitabine plus nab‐paclitaxel; and gemcitabine plus a fluoropyrimidine agent, provide a survival advantage over gemcitabine alone. These combinations do increase side effects. Gemcitabine given slowly using a fixed rate of infusion may be more effective than giving it in the standard way, which is quickly over 30 minutes. Quality of the evidence The quality of the evidence varied greatly amongst comparisons. The highest quality evidence was for gemcitabine versus fixed dose rate gemcitabine and some of the gemcitabine combinations (fluoropyrimidine, topoisomerase, and taxane). We judged the studies for quality using factors like how well they were conducted, how well they reported results and whether they used a placebo.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Epithelial ovarian cancer is the sixth most common cancer worldwide: 295,414 new cases were diagnosed in 2018, with 184,799 deaths. The lack of an effective screening strategy has led to the majority of women being diagnosed at an advanced stage. For these women, intravenous carboplatin combined with paclitaxel for six cycles is widely accepted as the standard first‐line treatment for epithelial ovarian cancer, in combination with debulking surgery. However, there is conflicting evidence regarding the optimal dosing schedule of paclitaxel when combined with carboplatin in this setting. Objectives To compare the efficacy and tolerability of intravenous weekly paclitaxel with that of tri‐weekly paclitaxel, in combination with intravenous carboplatin, as first‐line treatment for epithelial ovarian cancer (defined as epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal and fallopian tube cancer). Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase databases for relevant studies up to 15 November 2021, using keywords and MeSH terms. We additionally handsearched conference libraries, online clinical trial databases and screened through lists of retrieved references. Selection criteria We Included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing weekly paclitaxel in combination with carboplatin versus tri‐weekly paclitaxel in combination with carboplatin, for treatment of newly‐diagnosed epithelial ovarian cancer. Data collection and analysis We used the hazard ratio (HR) to estimate the primary efficacy outcomes progression‐free (PFS) and overall survival (OS). We used the risk ratio (RR) to estimate the primary toxicity outcome of severe neutropenia and secondary outcomes of quality of life (QoL) and treatment‐related adverse events. Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias, using standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We included individual participant data (IPD) from one of the included studies, ICON‐8, provided by the study team. We analysed data using a random‐effects model in Review Manager 5.4 software. Additionally, we reconstructed IPD for PFS and OS data from published Kaplan‐Meier curves from all studies and subsequently pooled these to analyse the two primary efficacy outcomes. Main results From 2469 records, we identified four eligible RCTs with data for 3699 participants. All eligible studies were included in the main meta‐analysis and reported on PFS and OS. There was likely a slight improvement in PFS when paclitaxel was dosed weekly compared to tri‐weekly (HR 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 0.98; 4 studies, 3699 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). We found little to no improvement in OS when paclitaxel was dosed weekly compared to tri‐weekly (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.06; 4 studies, 3699 participants; high‐certainty evidence). There was likely little to no difference in high‐grade (grade 3 or 4) neutropenia when paclitaxel was dosed weekly compared to tri‐weekly (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.43; 4 studies, 3639 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). However, weekly paclitaxel increased high‐grade (grade 3 or 4) anaemia when compared to tri‐weekly dosing (RR 1.57, 95% CI 1.12 to 2.20; 4 studies, 3639 participants; high‐certainty evidence). There may be little to no difference in high‐grade neuropathy when paclitaxel was dosed weekly compared to tri‐weekly (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.94; 4 studies, 3639 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The overall risk of detection bias and performance bias was low for OS, but was unclear for other outcomes, as treatments were not blinded. The risk of bias in other domains was low or unclear. We note that OS data were immature for three of the included studies (GOG‐0262, ICON‐8 and MITO‐7). Authors' conclusions Weekly paclitaxel combined with carboplatin for first‐line treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer likely improves PFS slightly (moderate‐certainty evidence) but not OS (high‐certainty evidence), compared to tri‐weekly paclitaxel combined with carboplatin. However, this was associated with increased risk for high‐grade anaemia, treatment discontinuation, dose delays and dose omissions (high‐ to low‐certainty evidence). Our findings may not apply to women receiving bevacizumab in first‐line therapy, those receiving treatment in the neo‐adjuvant setting, or those with rare subtypes of clear cell or mucinous ovarian cancer. Plain language summary Does weekly dosing of paclitaxel improve survival, compared with tri‐weekly dosing of paclitaxel in the initial treatment of ovarian cancer? Background  Ovarian cancer is the sixth most common cancer worldwide. Treatment consists of a combination of surgery and chemotherapy (most commonly including paclitaxel and carboplatin), with the aim to reduce or delay the return of the cancer (known as progression‐free survival (PFS)), and improve chances for cancer survival (known as overall survival (OS)). Several clinical trials (studies) have investigated whether the dosing schedule (timing) of paclitaxel affects these outcomes. However, the results from reported studies are conflicting. The aim of the review  We reviewed the evidence about the effect of different schedules of paclitaxel on survival in women with newly‐diagnosed ovarian cancer. Study characteristics  The evidence is current up to 15 November 2021. We included four studies with a total of 3699 participants. All studies included were randomised controlled trials (clinical trials where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) of women aged 18 years or older with newly diagnosed ovarian cancer. The studies compared weekly versus tri‐weekly dosing of paclitaxel, plus carboplatin. Main findings  We found that, compared with tri‐weekly paclitaxel dosing, weekly paclitaxel plus carboplatin likely slightly improves progression‐free survival, although results in little to no difference in overall survival (high‐certainty evidence). For adverse effects, we found that weekly paclitaxel plus carboplatin likely results in little to no difference in severe low neutrophil count (a type of white blood cell that helps to fight infections) (moderate‐certainty evidence); increases severe anaemia (haemoglobin level ‐ an important component of red blood cells) (high‐certainty evidence) and may result in little to no difference in severe damage to nerves (low‐certainty evidence). Conclusions  Weekly dosing of paclitaxel likely prolongs progression‐free survival compared to tri‐weekly dosing of paclitaxel, when combined with carboplatin in the initial treatment of ovarian cancer. However, this does not improve overall survival.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Gastric cancer is the fifth most common cancer worldwide. In "Western" countries, most people are either diagnosed at an advanced stage, or develop a relapse after surgery with curative intent. In people with advanced disease, significant benefits from targeted therapies are currently limited to HER‐2 positive disease treated with trastuzumab, in combination with chemotherapy, in first‐line. In second‐line, ramucirumab, alone or in combination with paclitaxel, demonstrated significant survival benefits. Thus, systemic chemotherapy remains the mainstay of treatment for advanced gastric cancer. Uncertainty remains regarding the choice of the regimen. Objectives To assess the efficacy of chemotherapy versus best supportive care (BSC), combination versus single‐agent chemotherapy and different chemotherapy combinations in advanced gastric cancer. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE and Embase up to June 2016, reference lists of studies, and contacted pharmaceutical companies and experts to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Selection criteria We considered only RCTs on systemic, intravenous or oral chemotherapy versus BSC, combination versus single‐agent chemotherapy and different chemotherapy regimens in advanced gastric cancer. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently identified studies and extracted data. A third investigator was consulted in case of disagreements. We contacted study authors to obtain missing information. Main results We included 64 RCTs, of which 60 RCTs (11,698 participants) provided data for the meta‐analysis of overall survival. We found chemotherapy extends overall survival (OS) by approximately 6.7 months more than BSC (hazard ratio (HR) 0.3, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.24 to 0.55, 184 participants, three studies, moderate‐quality evidence). Combination chemotherapy extends OS slightly (by an additional month) versus single‐agent chemotherapy (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.89, 4447 participants, 23 studies, moderate‐quality evidence), which is partly counterbalanced by increased toxicity. The benefit of epirubicin in three‐drug combinations, in which cisplatin is replaced by oxaliplatin and 5‐FU is replaced by capecitabine is unknown. Irinotecan extends OS slightly (by an additional 1.6 months) versus non‐irinotecan‐containing regimens (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.95, 2135 participants, 10 studies, high‐quality evidence). Docetaxel extends OS slightly (just over one month) compared to non‐docetaxel‐containing regimens (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.95, 2001 participants, eight studies, high‐quality evidence). However, due to subgroup analyses, we are uncertain whether docetaxel‐containing combinations (docetaxel added to a single‐agent or two‐drug combination) extends OS due to moderate‐quality evidence (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.91, 1466 participants, four studies, moderate‐quality evidence). When another chemotherapy was replaced by docetaxel, there is probably little or no difference in OS (HR 1.05; 0.87 to 1.27, 479 participants, three studies, moderate‐quality evidence). We found there is probably little or no difference in OS when comparing capecitabine versus 5‐FU‐containing regimens (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.11, 732 participants, five studies, moderate‐quality evidence) . Oxaliplatin may extend (by less than one month) OS versus cisplatin‐containing regimens (HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.98, 1105 participants, five studies, low‐quality evidence). We are uncertain whether taxane‐platinum combinations with (versus without) fluoropyrimidines extend OS due to very low‐quality evidence (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.06, 482 participants, three studies, very low‐quality evidence). S‐1 regimens improve OS slightly (by less than an additional month) versus 5‐FU‐containing regimens (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.00, 1793 participants, four studies, high‐quality evidence), however since S‐1 is used in different doses and schedules between Asian and non‐Asian population, the applicability of this finding to individual populations is uncertain. Authors' conclusions Chemotherapy improves survival (by an additional 6.7 months) in comparison to BSC, and combination chemotherapy improves survival (by an additional month) compared to single‐agent 5‐FU. Testing all patients for HER‐2 status may help to identify patients with HER‐2‐positive tumours, for whom, in the absence of contraindications, trastuzumab in combination with capecitabine or 5‐FU in combination with cisplatin has been shown to be beneficial. For HER‐2 negative people, all different two‐and three‐drug combinations including irinotecan, docetaxel, oxaliplatin or oral 5‐FU prodrugs are valid treatment options for advanced gastric cancer, and consideration of the side effects of each regimen is essential in the treatment decision. Irinotecan‐containing combinations and docetaxel‐containing combinations (in which docetaxel was added to a single‐agent or two‐drug (platinum/5‐FUcombination) show significant survival benefits in the comparisons studied above. Furthermore, docetaxel‐containing three‐drug regimens have increased response rates, but the advantages of the docetaxel‐containing three‐drug combinations (DCF, FLO‐T) are counterbalanced by increased toxicity. Additionally, oxaliplatin‐containing regimens demonstrated a benefit in OS as compared to the same regimen containing cisplatin, and there is a modest survival improvement of S‐1 compared to 5‐FU‐containing regimens. Whether the survival benefit for three‐drug combinations including cisplatin, 5‐FU, and epirubicin as compared to the same regimen without epirubicin is still valid when second‐line therapy is routinely administered and when cisplatin is replaced by oxaliplatin and 5‐FU by capecitabine is questionable. Furthermore, the magnitude of the observed survival benefits for the three‐drug regimens is not large enough to be clinically meaningful as defined recently by the American Society for Clinical Oncology ( Ellis 2014 ). In contrast to the comparisons in which a survival benefit was observed by adding a third drug to a two‐drug regimen at the cost of increased toxicity, the comparison of regimens in which another chemotherapy was replaced by irinotecan was associated with a survival benefit (of borderline statistical significance), but  without  increased toxicity. For this reason irinotecan/5‐FU‐containing combinations are an attractive option for first‐line treatment. Although they need to be interpreted with caution, subgroup analyses of one study suggest that elderly people have a greater benefit form oxaliplatin, as compared to cisplatin‐based regimens, and that people with locally advanced disease or younger than 65 years might benefit more from a three‐drug regimen including 5���FU, docetaxel, and oxaliplatin as compared to a two‐drug combination of 5‐FU and oxaliplatin, a hypothesis that needs further confirmation. For people with good performance status, the benefit of second‐line chemotherapy has been established in several RCTs. Plain language summary Chemotherapy for advanced gastric cancer Background Of all people with gastric cancer, in countries where screening is not routinely performed, 80% to 90% are either diagnosed at an advanced stage when the tumour is inoperable, or develop a recurrence within five years after surgery. Before starting any systemic chemotherapy in advanced disease, testing for over expression of the  H uman  E pidermal growth factor  R eceptor‐2 (abbreviated HER‐2) testing is mandatory, and people with HER‐2 over expression need, in the absence of contraindications, to be treated by a combination of a cisplatin/fluoropyrimidine‐based chemotherapy and trastuzumab (i.e. a monoclonal antibody directed against the human epidermal growth factor receptor II). Study Characteristics We searched biomedical databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials) until June 2016. We included 64 RCTs, of which 60 studies with 11,698 participants contained data on overall survival, in this review. We excluded 195 studies with reasons. Quality of the evidence The quality of evidence ranged from very low to high, depending on the comparison and outcome being assessed. Reasons for down grading the quality were due to risk of bias due to lack of blinded or independent radiological review, imprecision or heterogeneity. Key results Chemotherapy improves survival (by approximately 6.7 months) and quality of life in comparison to best supportive care alone, and first‐line combination chemotherapy improves survival (by one month) compared to single‐agent 5‐FU. The addition of docetaxel to platinum‐fluoropyrimidine‐based chemotherapy regimens appears to extend survival (by just over one additional month) at the cost of increased toxicity. Whether the benefit from adding a third drug (docetaxel or epirubicin) to a two‐drug platinum‐fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy combination outweighs its toxicity is unclear. Consideration of the profile of side effects and the impact of these side effects on the individual person's quality of life, as well as the tumour burden and necessity to obtain a response rapidly is therefore essential in the choice of the regimen. Additionally, irinotecan‐containing regimens prolonged overall survival (by an additional 1.6 months) compared to non‐irinotecan‐containing regimens.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Salvage systemic therapy has become the new standard of care in patients with advanced gastric and oesophago‐gastric junction (OGJ) adenocarcinoma, following disease progression on first‐line fluoropyrimidine and platinum‐containing chemotherapy. Pharmacological agents proven to be effective in this setting include both chemotherapy and biological therapy, however, the consensus on the best salvage systemic therapy has not been reached. Objectives To assess the effects of systemic chemotherapy and biological therapy, either alone or in combination, on overall survival (OS) and progression‐free survival (PFS) in patients with advanced gastric and OGJ adenocarcinoma, whose disease has progressed on, or relapsed after first‐line fluoropyrimidine and platinum‐containing chemotherapy. Adverse events (AEs), tumour response rate (TRR) and quality of life (QoL) associated with systemic chemotherapy and/or biological therapy were additionally assessed. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, trial registries and proceedings of the major oncology conferences up to October 2020. We additionally handsearched the reference lists of studies. No language restriction was applied. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing salvage systemic therapy (chemotherapy and/or biological therapy) and either another type of salvage systemic therapy, placebo, best supportive care (BSC) or no treatment in patients with gastric and OGJ adenocarcinoma refractory to first‐line fluoropyrimidine and platinum‐containing chemotherapy. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently performed selection of eligible studies and the primary author extracted study characteristics and outcome data from included studies. We assessed the quality and risk of bias of eligible studies according to the  Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions . We expressed pooled estimates of effect using hazard ratio (HR) calculated using an inverse variance random‐effects model for time‐to‐event data, and risk ratio (RR) calculated using Mantel‐Haenszel random‐effects model for binary data. The certainty of evidence was graded using GRADEpro. Main results We identified 17 RCTs with 5110 participants for inclusion in this review. Tweenty‐nine studies are ongoing and twenty studies are awaiting classification. No studies examined the following comparisons: chemotherapy combined with biological therapy versus placebo, BSC or no treatment, chemotherapy combined with biological therapy versus biological therapy, biological therapy versus biological therapy and chemotherapy combined with biological therapy versus chemotherapy combined with biological therapy. Chemotherapy versus placebo, best supportive care or no treatment Chemotherapy probably improves OS (HR = 0.66, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.83, moderate‐certainty evidence) based on two studies involving 547 participants and improves PFS (HR = 0.57, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.69, high‐certainty evidence) based on one study involving 507 participants over placebo and BSC. Chemotherapy probably increases serious AEs (SAEs) (RR = 1.38, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.59, moderate‐certainty evidence) based on one study involving 503 participants. Biological therapy versus placebo, best supportive care or no treatment Biological therapy improves OS (HR = 0.55, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.73, high‐certainty evidence) and probably improves PFS (HR = 0.33, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.57, moderate‐certainty evidence) over placebo based on three studies involving 781 participants. There is currently insufficient evidence for increased SAEs from biological therapy (RR = 1.14, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.37, low‐certainty evidence) based on two studies involving 638 participants. Chemotherapy versus biological therapy This comparison only considered immunotherapy. There is probably no evidence of a difference for OS (HR = 0.82, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.02, moderate‐certainty evidence) between chemotherapy and immunotherapy, and immunotherapy probably reduces PFS (HR = 1.27, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.57, moderate‐certainty evidence) based on one study involving 395 participants. SAEs may be less frequent with immunotherapy compared to chemotherapy (RR = 0.41, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.57, low‐certainty evidence). Chemotherapy combined with biological therapy versus chemotherapy Addition of biological therapy to chemotherapy probably does not improve OS (HR = 0.93, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.04, moderate‐certainty evidence) and we are uncertain whether it improves PFS (HR = 0.87, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.02, very low‐certainty evidence) based on seven studies involving 2743 participants. We are similarly uncertain whether combined chemotherapy and biological therapy increases SAEs (RR = 1.17, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.44, very low‐certainty evidence) based on four studies involving 1618 participants. Chemotherapy versus chemotherapy There is no evidence of a difference for OS and PFS between irinotecan and paclitaxel (HR = 1.13, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.48, low‐certainty evidence for OS; HR = 1.14, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.48, low‐certainty evidence for PFS) based on one study involving 219 participants. Similarly, there is no evidence to indicate improved OS and PFS from addition of another chemotherapy to docetaxel (HR = 1.05, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.54, low‐certainty evidence for OS; HR = 0.75, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.09, low‐certainty evidence for PFS) based on two studies involving 121 participants. Grade ≥ 3 neutropenia occurred commonly with both mono‐ and poly‐chemotherapy except for docetaxel‐S1 and EOX chemotherapy. Authors' conclusions Survival outcome of patients with advanced gastric and OGJ adenocarcinoma whose disease progressed on first‐line fluoropyrimidine and platinum‐containing chemotherapy can be improved by chemotherapy and biological therapy. Biological therapy, in particular, achieves this without clear increase in SAEs or QoL impairment. Whether biological therapy is preferred over chemotherapy is still unclear and there is no evidence of a difference for OS outcome, although immunotherapy may be associated with less SAEs. Addition of biological therapy to chemotherapy and poly‐chemotherapy are associated with frequent treatment‐related toxicity without clear survival benefit. Plain language summary Which treatments work best for advanced stomach cancer that has not responded to standard chemotherapy? What is advanced stomach cancer? Gastric (stomach) cancer usually begins in the mucous‐producing cells lining the stomach. Oesophago‐gastric junction (OGJ) cancer starts where the food pipe (oesophagus) joins the stomach. Advanced cancer is cancer that has spread to nearby tissues, or to another part of the body, despite treatment. Treatments for gastric and OGJ cancer include: • operation to remove the cancer; • chemotherapy (medicines that kill cancer cells); • radiotherapy (radiation to kill cancer cells); and • biological therapy (medicines made from proteins and other substances that occur naturally in the body). Biological therapies include immunotherapy (medicines that help the immune system to recognise and kill cancer cells) and therapies that target something in, or surrounding, the cancer, such as the cancer's blood supply. Standard chemotherapy usually combines two medicines containing fluoropyrimidine and platinum. When standard chemotherapy for advanced cancer has not worked, further treatment aims to slow the growth of the cancer to help people live longer. Further treatments include: other chemotherapy medicines, biological therapies, and best supportive care (care that helps a person cope with life‐limiting illness and its treatment). Why we did this Cochrane Review Stomach and OGJ cancer are difficult to treat. We wanted to find out which treatments work best to control these cancers and help people live longer, when standard chemotherapy has not worked. What did we do? We searched for studies that looked at chemotherapy and/or biological therapies for advanced stomach or OGJ cancer that had not responded to standard chemotherapy. We looked for studies in which the treatment each person received was decided at random. These studies usually give the most reliable evidence about the effects of treatments. Search date We included evidence published up to October 2020. What we found We found 17 studies in 5110 people with advanced stomach or OGJ cancer. Studies compared further chemotherapy and/or biological therapies, given by mouth or through the bloodstream (systemic), with: • another systemic chemotherapy and/or biological therapy; • a placebo ('dummy' treatment); • best supportive care; and • no treatment. The studies looked at: • how long people lived; • any adverse (unwanted) effects; and • their quality of life (well‐being). What are the results of our review? People probably live longer after further chemotherapy (irinotecan or trifluridine plus tipiracil) than with placebo treatment or best supportive care. But chemotherapy probably increases serious unwanted effects, including diarrhoea, fever, and lower numbers of red and white blood cells. People may live as long after irinotecan chemotherapy as after paclitaxel chemotherapy. Adding another chemotherapy (oxaliplatin or cisplatin) to docetaxel may not affect how long people live. People live longer after biological therapy (nivolumab, apatinib or regorafenib) than with placebo treatment. We did not find enough evidence about whether biological therapy increases unwanted effects. People given immunotherapy (pembrolizumab) probably live as long as people given chemotherapy (paclitaxel), but may not have as many unwanted effects as with chemotherapy. Combining chemotherapy with biological therapy probably does not help people live longer than chemotherapy alone, and we are uncertain whether it increases unwanted effects. How reliable are these results? We are moderately confident that chemotherapy probably helps people to live longer than placebo treatment or best supportive care. We are confident that people live longer on biological therapy than placebo treatment. We think more evidence is unlikely to change this result. We are less confident about the results for unwanted effects. Some studies had missing data or did not report these; and in some studies people and their doctors knew which treatment was given, which could have affected the study results. These results are likely to change when more evidence becomes available. Conclusions If advanced stomach or OGJ cancer has not responded to standard chemotherapy, further chemotherapy or biological therapy help people to live longer than placebo treatment, best supportive care, or no treatment. However, chemotherapy is more clearly associated with unwanted effects than biological therapy. We are unsure if biological therapies work better than chemotherapy, but they may cause fewer unwanted effects. Combining chemotherapy and biological therapies may cause more unwanted effects without giving any extra benefit.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is a B‐cell lymphoma accounting for 10% to 15% of all lymphoma in industrialised countries. It has a bimodal age distribution with one peak around the age of 30 years and another after the age of 60 years. Although HL accounts for fewer than 1% of all neoplasms worldwide, it is considered to be one of the most common malignancies in young adults and, with cure rates of 90%, one of the most curable cancers worldwide. Current treatment options for HL comprise more‐ or less‐intensified regimens of chemotherapy plus radiotherapy, depending on disease stage. [18F]‐fluorodeoxy‐D‐glucose (FDG)‐positron emission tomography (PET, also called PET scanning) is an imaging tool that can be used to illustrate a tumour's metabolic activity, stage and progression. Therefore, it could be used as a standard interim procedure during HL treatment, to help distinguish between individuals who are good or poor early responders to therapy. Subsequent therapy could then be de‐escalated in PET‐negative individuals (good responders) or escalated in those who are PET‐positive (poor responders). It is currently unknown whether such response‐adapted therapeutic strategies are of benefit to individuals in terms of overall and progression‐free survival, and the incidence of long‐term adverse events (AEs). Objectives To assess the effects of interim [18F]‐FDG‐PET imaging treatment modification in individuals with HL. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; latest issue) and MEDLINE (from 1990 to September 2014) as well as conference proceedings (American Society of Hematology; American Society of Clinical Oncology; European Hematology Association; and International Symposium on Hodgkin Lymphoma) for studies. Two review authors independently screened search results. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing FDG‐PET‐adapted therapy with non‐adapted treatment in individuals with previously untreated HL of all stages and ages. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the quality of trials. As none of the included studies provided HRs for OS, we described risk ratios (RRs) for this outcome and did not pool the data. As an effect measure we used hazard ratios (HRs) for progression‐free survival (PFS). We described RRs for the dichotomous data on AEs. We also calculated 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Main results Our search strategies led to 308 potentially relevant references. From these, we included three studies involving 1999 participants. We judged the overall potential risk of bias as moderate. The studies were reported as RCTs; blinding was not reported, but given the study design it is likely that there was no blinding. One study was published in abstract form only; hence, detailed assessment of the risk of bias was not possible. Two trials compared standard treatment (chemotherapy plus radiotherapy) with PET‐adapted therapy (chemotherapy only) in individuals with early‐stage HL and negative PET scans. The study design of the third trial was more complex. Participants with early‐stage HL were divided into those with a favourable or unfavourable prognosis. They were then randomised to receive PET‐adapted or standard treatment. Following a PET scan, participants were further divided into PET‐positive and PET‐negative groups. To date, data have been published for the PET‐negative arms only, making it possible to perform a meta‐analysis including all three trials. Of the 1999 participants included in the three trials only 1480 were analysed. The 519 excluded participants were either PET‐positive, or were excluded because they did not match the inclusion criteria. One study reported no deaths. The other two studies reported two deaths in participants receiving PET‐adapted therapy and two in participants receiving standard therapy (very‐low‐quality evidence). Progression‐free survival was shorter in participants with PET‐adapted therapy (without radiotherapy) than in those receiving standard treatment with radiotherapy (HR 2.38; 95% CI 1.62 to 3.50; P value < 0.0001). This difference was also apparent in comparisons of participants receiving no additional radiotherapy (PET‐adapted therapy) versus radiotherapy (standard therapy) (HR 1.86; 95% CI 1.07 to 3.23; P value = 0.03) and in those receiving chemotherapy but no radiotherapy (PET‐adapted therapy) versus standard radiotherapy (HR 3.00; 95% CI 1.75 to 5.14; P value < 0.0001) (moderate‐quality evidence). Short‐term AEs only were assessed in one trial, which showed no evidence of a difference between the treatment arms (RR 0.91; 95% CI 0.54 to 1.53; P value = 0.72) (very‐low‐quality evidence). No data on long‐term AEs were reported in any of the trials. Authors' conclusions To date, no robust data on OS, response rate, TRM, QoL, or short‐ and long‐term AEs are available. However, this systematic review found moderate‐quality evidence that PFS was shorter in individuals with early‐stage HL and a negative PET scan receiving chemotherapy only (PET‐adapted therapy) than in those receiving additional radiotherapy (standard therapy). More RCTs with longer follow ups may lead to more precise results for AEs, TRM and QoL, and could evaluate whether this PFS advantage will translate into an overall survival benefit. It is still uncertain whether PET‐positive individuals benefit from PET‐based treatment adaptation and the effect of such an approach in those with advanced HL. Plain language summary Imaging‐adapted therapy for individuals with Hodgkin lymphoma Background Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is a malignant disease of the lymphatic system of the body. It accounts for 10% to 15% of all lymphoma in industrialised countries and tends to show two peaks in incidence at around 30 and 60 years of age. While it is considered a relatively rare disease, it is one of the most common malignancies in young adults. With cure rates of up to 90% over 5 years, it is one of the most curable cancers worldwide. The imaging of tumour tissue using a technique termed positron emission tomography (PET) has been shown to provide a good way of estimating the activity of a tumour. The question therefore arises of whether this technique could be used as an tool during therapy to identify individuals who are, or are not, responding to chemotherapy. This would enable further treatment to be modified, resulting in individualised therapy. Treatment could be reduced or stopped in individuals who show a good response to chemotherapy, thus reducing the risk of long‐term adverse events, or increased in those showing a poor response to chemotherapy. Review question In this systematic review we address the issue of whether PET‐adapted therapy in individuals with HL results in beneficial outcomes such as longer overall survival (OS) and survival without disease progression (termed progression‐free survival or PFS), higher responses to therapy and participant quality of life (QoL), or reductions in adverse events (such as second malignancies) or treatment‐related mortality. Study characteristics We searched important medical databases such as the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and MEDLINE. Two review authors independently screened, summarised and analysed the results. This lead to the inclusion of three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with 1999 participants. Currently, only data for 1480 of these participants have been published and were included in this systematic review. Participants were randomised to receive either standard therapy (chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy) or PET‐adapted therapy (chemotherapy only). The median age of participants was 32 years and 52% were male. The evidence provided is current to September 2014. Key results We are unable to draw conclusions about the effect of PET‐adapted therapy on OS as there was insufficient data available (4 deaths in 1480 participants). However, PFS was shorter following PET‐adapted therapy than with standard treatment. Based on our data, we can assume that of 1000 individuals receiving PET‐adapted treatment over 4 years, 222 individuals would experience disease progression or death compared with 100 of 1000 individuals receiving standard treatment. Only one trial reported on short‐term adverse events and the findings were uncertain and do not provide reliable evidence. The studies did not provide any information on the outcomes of QoL, response to therapy or treatment‐related mortality. Quality of evidence We judged the quality of evidence for the outcomes of OS and adverse events as very low. We considered the quality of evidence for PFS to be moderate. Conclusion To date, no robust data on OS are available. This systematic review shows that individuals with early‐stage HL have a shorter PFS after PET‐adapted therapy compared with those who receive standard therapy. More RCTs with longer follow ups may lead to more information on adverse events, treatment‐related mortality and QoL, and could evaluate whether the PFS advantage seen with standard therapy will translate into a benefit in terms of OS.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune disease with significant morbidity and mortality. Cutaneous disease in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is common. Many interventions are used to treat SLE with varying efficacy, risks, and benefits. Objectives To assess the effects of interventions for cutaneous disease in SLE. Search methods We searched the following databases up to June 2019: the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Wiley Interscience Online Library, and Biblioteca Virtual em Saude (Virtual Health Library). We updated our search in September 2020, but these results have not yet been fully incorporated. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions for cutaneous disease in SLE compared with placebo, another intervention, no treatment, or different doses of the same intervention. We did not evaluate trials of cutaneous lupus in people without a diagnosis of SLE. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Primary outcomes were complete and partial clinical response. Secondary outcomes included reduction (or change) in number of clinical flares; and severe and minor adverse events. We used GRADE to assess the quality of evidence. Main results Sixty‐one RCTs, involving 11,232 participants, reported 43 different interventions. Trials predominantly included women from outpatient clinics; the mean age range of participants was 20 to 40 years. Twenty‐five studies reported baseline severity, and 22 studies included participants with moderate to severe cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE); duration of CLE was not well reported. Studies were conducted mainly in multi‐centre settings. Most often treatment duration was 12 months. Risk of bias was highest for the domain of reporting bias, followed by performance/detection bias. We identified too few studies for meta‐analysis for most comparisons. We limited this abstract to main comparisons (all administered orally) and outcomes. We did not identify clinical trials of other commonly used treatments, such as topical corticosteroids, that reported complete or partial clinical response or numbers of clinical flares. Complete clinical response Studies comparing oral hydroxychloroquine against placebo did not report complete clinical response. Chloroquine may increase complete clinical response at 12 months' follow‐up compared with placebo (absence of skin lesions) (risk ratio (RR) 1.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95 to 2.61; 1 study, 24 participants; low‐quality evidence). There may be little to no difference between methotrexate and chloroquine in complete clinical response (skin rash resolution) at 6 months' follow‐up (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.50; 1 study, 25 participants; low‐quality evidence). Methotrexate may be superior to placebo with regard to complete clinical response (absence of malar/discoid rash) at 6 months' follow‐up (RR 3.57, 95% CI 1.63 to 7.84; 1 study, 41 participants; low‐quality evidence). At 12 months' follow‐up, there may be little to no difference between azathioprine and ciclosporin in complete clinical response (malar rash resolution) (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.52; 1 study, 89 participants; low‐quality evidence). Partial clinical response Partial clinical response was reported for only one key comparison: hydroxychloroquine may increase partial clinical response at 12 months compared to placebo, but the 95% CI indicates that hydroxychloroquine may make no difference or may decrease response (RR 7.00, 95% CI 0.41 to 120.16; 20 pregnant participants, 1 trial; low‐quality evidence). Clinical flares Clinical flares were reported for only two key comparisons: hydroxychloroquine is probably superior to placebo at 6 months' follow‐up for reducing clinical flares (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.89; 1 study, 47 participants; moderate‐quality evidence). At 12 months' follow‐up, there may be no difference between methotrexate and placebo, but the 95% CI indicates there may be more or fewer flares with methotrexate (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.83; 1 study, 86 participants; moderate‐quality evidence). Adverse events Data for adverse events were limited and were inconsistently reported, but hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and methotrexate have well‐documented adverse effects including gastrointestinal symptoms, liver problems, and retinopathy for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine and teratogenicity during pregnancy for methotrexate. Authors' conclusions Evidence supports the commonly‐used treatment hydroxychloroquine, and there is also evidence supporting chloroquine and methotrexate for treating cutaneous disease in SLE. Evidence is limited due to the small number of studies reporting key outcomes. Evidence for most key outcomes was low or moderate quality, meaning findings should be interpreted with caution. Head‐to‐head intervention trials designed to detect differences in efficacy between treatments for specific CLE subtypes are needed. Thirteen further trials are awaiting classification and have not yet been incorporated in this review; they may alter the review conclusions. Plain language summary What are the benefits and risks of different treatments for skin disease in people with systemic lupus erythematosus (an autoimmune disease that affects the whole body) Why is this question important? Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE; also known as ‘lupus’) is a disease in which the body's immune (defence) system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue in many parts of the body. It affects 7.5 million people worldwide. Around 70% of affected people develop skin problems such as rash on the nose or cheeks. Often, SLE also causes pain in joints and muscles and extreme tiredness. Symptoms can improve temporarily, or they can worsen suddenly (flares). In severe cases, SLE can cause life‐threatening damage to the heart, lungs, brain, or kidneys. There is no cure for SLE. However, there are treatments designed to improve symptoms. In particular, there are a range of options for treating skin problems. • Medicines that can be taken by mouth (orally), applied as creams, or given as injections. • Therapies to help people cope with their skin problems, such as talking therapies. • Other approaches, including herbal medicine, light therapy, or make‐up. To find out which treatments work best for people with SLE, and to compare adverse (unwanted) effects, we reviewed the evidence from research studies. How did we identify and evaluate the evidence? We searched the medical literature for studies that compared any treatment for skin disease in SLE against: • a placebo (dummy) treatment; • no treatment; • another treatment; or • a different dose of the same treatment. We compared the results and summarised the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods and sizes and the consistency of findings across studies. What did we find? We found 61 studies that included 11,232 people (mostly women) and investigated 43 different treatments. Most treatments lasted one year, and people were followed for up to 48 months. Here we report the main findings of our review on the effects of five different oral medicines: hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, methotrexate, ciclosporin, and azathioprine. Disappearance of skin problems We do not know if hydroxychloroquine is better or worse than placebo at making skin problems disappear because no studies reported information about this. The evidence suggests that: • chloroquine may be better at making skin problems disappear after 12 months than placebo (1 study, 24 people); • when we compare methotrexate and choloroquine, there may be little to no difference in how often they make skin rashes disappear after six months (1 study, 25 people); • methotrexate may be better for making skin rashes disappear after six months than placebo (1 study, 41 people); and • there may be little to no difference in how often skin problems disappear after 12 months between ciclosporin and aziathropine (1 study, 25 people). Partial disappearance of skin problems (at least 50% improvement in the skin condition) It is unclear if hydroxycholoroquine is better or worse than placebo at making skin problems disappear at least partially after 12 months. This is because the evidence is too imprecise (1 study, 20 pregnant women). No other studies have examined how treatments affect the partial disappearance of skin problems. Flares The evidence suggests that after six months, fewer flares probably occur with hydroxychloroquine than with placebo (1 study, 47 people). It is unclear if flares are more, or less, likely to occur after 12 months with methotrexate compared to placebo (1 study, 86 people). No other studies have reported information on how treatments affect flares. Adverse events Evidence is often imprecise, and whether treatments lead to more or fewer adverse events than placebo or other treatments is not clear. We found limited data for adverse events, and reports were discrepant, but hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and methotrexate have well‐known adverse effects including stomach and liver problems. Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine can cause eye problems, and methotrexate can cause serious harm to a developing baby if taken during pregnancy. Other outcomes We do not know how treatments affect other aspects of disease severity or quality of life. This is because studies did not report information on this. What does this mean? When compared against a placebo, studies in people with SLE show that: • fewer flares probably occur with hydroxychloroquine; and • methotrexate and chloroquine may be better at making skin problems disappear. Information about adverse effects is limited. How up‐to‐date is this review? The evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to June 2019.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background The prognosis of people with metastatic cutaneous melanoma, a skin cancer, is generally poor. Recently, new classes of drugs (e.g. immune checkpoint inhibitors and small‐molecule targeted drugs) have significantly improved patient prognosis, which has drastically changed the landscape of melanoma therapeutic management. This is an update of a Cochrane Review published in 2000. Objectives To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of systemic treatments for metastatic cutaneous melanoma. Search methods We searched the following databases up to October 2017: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and LILACS. We also searched five trials registers and the ASCO database in February 2017, and checked the reference lists of included studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Selection criteria We considered RCTs of systemic therapies for people with unresectable lymph node metastasis and distant metastatic cutaneous melanoma compared to any other treatment. We checked the reference lists of selected articles to identify further references to relevant trials. Data collection and analysis Two review authors extracted data, and a third review author independently verified extracted data. We implemented a network meta‐analysis approach to make indirect comparisons and rank treatments according to their effectiveness (as measured by the impact on survival) and harm (as measured by occurrence of high‐grade toxicity). The same two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias of eligible studies according to Cochrane standards and assessed evidence quality based on the GRADE criteria. Main results We included 122 RCTs (28,561 participants). Of these, 83 RCTs, encompassing 21 different comparisons, were included in meta‐analyses. Included participants were men and women with a mean age of 57.5 years who were recruited from hospital settings. Twenty‐nine studies included people whose cancer had spread to their brains. Interventions were categorised into five groups: conventional chemotherapy (including single agent and polychemotherapy), biochemotherapy (combining chemotherapy with cytokines such as interleukin‐2 and interferon‐alpha), immune checkpoint inhibitors (such as anti‐CTLA4 and anti‐PD1 monoclonal antibodies), small‐molecule targeted drugs used for melanomas with specific gene changes (such as BRAF inhibitors and MEK inhibitors), and other agents (such as anti‐angiogenic drugs). Most interventions were compared with chemotherapy. In many cases, trials were sponsored by pharmaceutical companies producing the tested drug: this was especially true for new classes of drugs, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors and small‐molecule targeted drugs. When compared to single agent chemotherapy, the combination of multiple chemotherapeutic agents (polychemotherapy) did not translate into significantly better survival (overall survival: HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.16, 6 studies, 594 participants; high‐quality evidence; progression‐free survival: HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.25, 5 studies, 398 participants; high‐quality evidence. Those who received combined treatment are probably burdened by higher toxicity rates (RR 1.97, 95% CI 1.44 to 2.71, 3 studies, 390 participants; moderate‐quality evidence). (We defined toxicity as the occurrence of grade 3 (G3) or higher adverse events according to the World Health Organization scale.) Compared to chemotherapy, biochemotherapy (chemotherapy combined with both interferon‐alpha and interleukin‐2) improved progression‐free survival (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.99, 6 studies, 964 participants; high‐quality evidence), but did not significantly improve overall survival (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.06, 7 studies, 1317 participants; high‐quality evidence). Biochemotherapy had higher toxicity rates (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.61, 2 studies, 631 participants; high‐quality evidence). With regard to immune checkpoint inhibitors, anti‐CTLA4 monoclonal antibodies plus chemotherapy probably increased the chance of progression‐free survival compared to chemotherapy alone (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.92, 1 study, 502 participants; moderate‐quality evidence), but may not significantly improve overall survival (HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.01, 2 studies, 1157 participants; low‐quality evidence). Compared to chemotherapy alone, anti‐CTLA4 monoclonal antibodies is likely to be associated with higher toxicity rates (RR 1.69, 95% CI 1.19 to 2.42, 2 studies, 1142 participants; moderate‐quality evidence). Compared to chemotherapy, anti‐PD1 monoclonal antibodies (immune checkpoint inhibitors) improved overall survival (HR 0.42, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.48, 1 study, 418 participants; high‐quality evidence) and probably improved progression‐free survival (HR 0.49, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.61, 2 studies, 957 participants; moderate‐quality evidence). Anti‐PD1 monoclonal antibodies may also result in less toxicity than chemotherapy (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.97, 3 studies, 1360 participants; low‐quality evidence). Anti‐PD1 monoclonal antibodies performed better than anti‐CTLA4 monoclonal antibodies in terms of overall survival (HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.66, 1 study, 764 participants; high‐quality evidence) and progression‐free survival (HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.60, 2 studies, 1465 participants; high‐quality evidence). Anti‐PD1 monoclonal antibodies may result in better toxicity outcomes than anti‐CTLA4 monoclonal antibodies (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.91, 2 studies, 1465 participants; low‐quality evidence). Compared to anti‐CTLA4 monoclonal antibodies alone, the combination of anti‐CTLA4 plus anti‐PD1 monoclonal antibodies was associated with better progression‐free survival (HR 0.40, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.46, 2 studies, 738 participants; high‐quality evidence). There may be no significant difference in toxicity outcomes (RR 1.57, 95% CI 0.85 to 2.92, 2 studies, 764 participants; low‐quality evidence) (no data for overall survival were available). The class of small‐molecule targeted drugs, BRAF inhibitors (which are active exclusively against BRAF‐mutated melanoma), performed better than chemotherapy in terms of overall survival (HR 0.40, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.57, 2 studies, 925 participants; high‐quality evidence) and progression‐free survival (HR 0.27, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.34, 2 studies, 925 participants; high‐quality evidence), and there may be no significant difference in toxicity (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.48 to 3.33, 2 studies, 408 participants; low‐quality evidence). Compared to chemotherapy, MEK inhibitors (which are active exclusively against BRAF‐mutated melanoma) may not significantly improve overall survival (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.25, 3 studies, 496 participants; low‐quality evidence), but they probably lead to better progression‐free survival (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.80, 3 studies, 496 participants; moderate‐quality evidence). However, MEK inhibitors probably have higher toxicity rates (RR 1.61, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.41, 1 study, 91 participants; moderate‐quality evidence). Compared to BRAF inhibitors, the combination of BRAF plus MEK inhibitors was associated with better overall survival (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.82, 4 studies, 1784 participants; high‐quality evidence). BRAF plus MEK inhibitors was also probably better in terms of progression‐free survival (HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.71, 4 studies, 1784 participants; moderate‐quality evidence), and there appears likely to be no significant difference in toxicity (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.20, 4 studies, 1774 participants; moderate‐quality evidence). Compared to chemotherapy, the combination of chemotherapy plus anti‐angiogenic drugs was probably associated with better overall survival (HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.81; moderate‐quality evidence) and progression‐free survival (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.92; moderate‐quality evidence). There may be no difference in terms of toxicity (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.09 to 5.32; low‐quality evidence). All results for this comparison were based on 324 participants from 2 studies. Network meta‐analysis focused on chemotherapy as the common comparator and currently approved treatments for which high‐ to moderate‐quality evidence of efficacy (as represented by treatment effect on progression‐free survival) was available (based on the above results) for: biochemotherapy (with both interferon‐alpha and interleukin‐2); anti‐CTLA4 monoclonal antibodies; anti‐PD1 monoclonal antibodies; anti‐CTLA4 plus anti‐PD1 monoclonal antibodies; BRAF inhibitors; MEK inhibitors, and BRAF plus MEK inhibitors. Analysis (which included 19 RCTs and 7632 participants) generated 21 indirect comparisons. The best evidence (moderate‐quality evidence) for progression‐free survival was found for the following indirect comparisons: • both combinations of immune checkpoint inhibitors (HR 0.30, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.51) and small‐molecule targeted drugs (HR 0.17, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.26) probably improved progression‐free survival compared to chemotherapy; • both BRAF inhibitors (HR 0.40, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.68) and combinations of small‐molecule targeted drugs (HR 0.22, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.39) were probably associated with better progression‐free survival compared to anti‐CTLA4 monoclonal antibodies; • biochemotherapy (HR 2.81, 95% CI 1.76 to 4.51) probably lead to worse progression‐free survival compared to BRAF inhibitors; • the combination of small‐molecule targeted drugs probably improved progression‐free survival (HR 0.38, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.68) compared to anti‐PD1 monoclonal antibodies; • both biochemotherapy (HR 5.05, 95% CI 3.01 to 8.45) and MEK inhibitors (HR 3.16, 95% CI 1.77 to 5.65) were probably associated with worse progression‐free survival compared to the combination of small‐molecule targeted drugs; and • biochemotherapy was probably associated with worse progression‐free survival (HR 2.81, 95% CI 1.54 to 5.11) compared to the combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors. The best evidence (moderate‐quality evidence) for toxicity was found for the following indirect comparisons: • combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors (RR 3.49, 95% CI 2.12 to 5.77) probably increased toxicity compared to chemotherapy; • combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors probably increased toxicity (RR 2.50, 95% CI 1.20 to 5.20) compared to BRAF inhibitors; • the combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors probably increased toxicity (RR 3.83, 95% CI 2.59 to 5.68) compared to anti‐PD1 monoclonal antibodies; and • biochemotherapy was probably associated with lower toxicity (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.71) compared to the combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Network meta‐analysis‐based ranking suggested that the combination of BRAF plus MEK inhibitors is the most effective strategy in terms of progression‐free survival, whereas anti‐PD1 monoclonal antibodies are associated with the lowest toxicity. Overall, the risk of bias of the included trials can be considered as limited. When considering the 122 trials included in this review and the seven types of bias we assessed, we performed 854 evaluations only seven of which (< 1%) assigned high risk to six trials. Authors' conclusions We found high‐quality evidence that many treatments offer better efficacy than chemotherapy, especially recently implemented treatments, such as small‐molecule targeted drugs, which are used to treat melanoma with specific gene mutations. Compared with chemotherapy, biochemotherapy (in this case, chemotherapy combined with both interferon‐alpha and interleukin‐2) and BRAF inhibitors improved progression‐free survival; BRAF inhibitors (for BRAF‐mutated melanoma) and anti‐PD1 monoclonal antibodies improved overall survival. However, there was no difference between polychemotherapy and monochemotherapy in terms of achieving progression‐free survival and overall survival. Biochemotherapy did not significantly improve overall survival and has higher toxicity rates compared with chemotherapy. There was some evidence that combined treatments worked better than single treatments: anti‐PD1 monoclonal antibodies, alone or with anti‐CTLA4, improved progression‐free survival compared with anti‐CTLA4 monoclonal antibodies alone. Anti‐PD1 monoclonal antibodies performed better than anti‐CTLA4 monoclonal antibodies in terms of overall survival, and a combination of BRAF plus MEK inhibitors was associated with better overall survival for BRAF‐mutated melanoma, compared to BRAF inhibitors alone. The combination of BRAF plus MEK inhibitors (which can only be administered to people with BRAF‐mutated melanoma) appeared to be the most effective treatment (based on results for progression‐free survival), whereas anti‐PD1 monoclonal antibodies appeared to be the least toxic, and most acceptable, treatment. Evidence quality was reduced due to imprecision, between‐study heterogeneity, and substandard reporting of trials. Future research should ensure that those diminishing influences are addressed. Clinical areas of future investigation should include the longer‐term effect of new therapeutic agents (i.e. immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeted therapies) on overall survival, as well as the combination of drugs used in melanoma treatment; research should also investigate the potential influence of biomarkers. Plain language summary Systemic treatments (tablets or injections) taken for metastatic melanoma (expanded from its starting point to other parts of the body) Background Melanoma is the most dangerous common skin cancer. Early diagnosis offers the best chance of cure. People affected by early stage melanoma represent about 70% to 80% of all those with melanoma and can be treated by surgical removal of the original tumour (known as the primary tumour). However, when a primary melanoma is detected at a later stage, there is a risk of disease spreading to the nearest lymph nodes (glands that are part of the body's immune system) and distant sites, such as the lungs, liver, bone and brain. In this case, systemic chemotherapy (giving drugs that kill cells throughout the body) and biochemotherapy (chemotherapy combined with substances that can improve the immune response, known as immunostimulating cytokines, such as interleukin‐2 and interferon‐alpha) have been the main treatments for over three decades. However, only few people experience spontaneous (i.e. not resulting from therapy) regression of the primary tumour. Over the past few years, new classes of drugs have been used with promising results. We aimed to look at how new systemic treatments compare with older therapies, as well as with each other, in terms of survival, acceptability, tumour response, and quality of life. We assessed these outcomes in people with metastatic melanoma (AJCC TNM stage IV). Review question We aimed to assess the effects of systemic treatments for people with metastatic cutaneous melanoma (melanoma of skin tissue). We searched for relevant trials up to October 2017 and included 122 studies. We summarised the results of melanoma treatments (delivered systemically), such as conventional chemotherapy, biochemotherapy, as well as newer drug classes, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti‐CTLA4 and anti‐PD1 monoclonal antibodies, which increase the anti‐tumour activity of the immune system), small‐molecule targeted drugs (BRAF inhibitors, which are used only for melanomas containing specific BRAF gene mutations that promote tumour progression, and MEK inhibitors, which work on the same molecular pathway), and anti‐angiogenic drugs (which reduce blood supply to cancer cells). We compared these treatments with conventional chemotherapy. Study characteristics All 122 studies were randomised controlled trials that enrolled participants with metastatic cutaneous melanoma and compared different systemic treatments (28,561 participants). Study participants were adults of either sex, with a mean age of 57.5 years. There were 29 studies that included people whose cancer had spread to the brain, which is important because the detection and treatment of brain metastases often present unique challenges. Most treatments were compared with chemotherapy, and all studies were set in hospitals. Frequently, the pharmaceutical company who produced a tested drug also sponsored the study in which it was assessed, especially in the case of new classes of drugs, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors and small‐molecule targeted drugs. Key results Compared to conventional chemotherapy, several treatments can improve the progression‐free survival of people with metastatic melanoma. These include biochemotherapy (high‐quality evidence), anti‐CTLA4 monoclonal antibodies plus chemotherapy (moderate‐quality evidence), anti‐PD1 monoclonal antibodies (moderate‐quality evidence), BRAF inhibitors (high‐quality evidence), MEK inhibitors (moderate‐quality evidence), and anti‐angiogenic drugs (moderate‐quality evidence). However, no difference was found for use of a combination of several chemotherapy agents (polychemotherapy) (high‐quality evidence). Moreover, the combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti‐PD1 plus anti‐CTLA4 monoclonal antibodies) performed better than anti‐CTLA4 monoclonal antibodies alone (high‐quality evidence), but anti‐PD1 monoclonal antibodies performed better than anti‐CTLA4 monoclonal antibodies (high‐quality evidence). The combination of small‐molecule inhibitors (BRAF plus MEK inhibitors) lead to better results than BRAF inhibitors alone (moderate‐quality evidence), for people with melanoma that has a BRAF gene change . Anti‐PD1 monoclonal antibodies improved patients' overall survival compared with either standard chemotherapy (high‐quality evidence) or anti‐CTLA4 monoclonal antibodies (high‐quality evidence). Compared to chemotherapy alone, both BRAF inhibitors (high‐quality evidence), and anti‐angiogenic agents combined with chemotherapy (moderate‐quality evidence) also prolong overall survival, but anti‐CTLA4 monoclonal antibodies plus chemotherapy (low‐quality evidence), MEK inhibitors (low‐quality evidence), combined multiple chemotherapeutic agents (polychemotherapy) (high‐quality evidence), or biochemotherapy (high‐quality evidence) did not lead to significantly improved overall survival. WE also found that the combination of small‐molecule inhibitors performed better than BRAF inhibitors alone (high‐quality evidence). No data on overall survival were available for anti‐CTLA4 monoclonal antibodies alone compared with the combination of anti‐CTLA4 plus anti‐PD1 monoclonal antibodies. In terms of toxicity (defined as occurrence of high‐grade side effects), biochemotherapy (high‐quality evidence), anti‐CTLA4 monoclonal antibodies (moderate‐quality evidence), polychemotherapy (moderate‐quality evidence), and MEK inhibitors (moderate‐quality evidence) were associated with worse toxicity compared to chemotherapy. In contrast, anti‐PD1 monoclonal antibodies appear to be better tolerated than chemotherapy alone. Anti‐PD1 monoclonal antibodies also appeared to be better tolerated than anti‐CTLA4 monoclonal antibodies. However, evidence quality supporting these findings was assessed as low. Furthermore, the frequency of side effects did not differ significantly between anti‐PD1 plus anti‐CTLA4 monoclonal antibodies versus anti‐CTLA4 monoclonal antibodies alone (low‐quality evidence), anti‐angiogenic drugs combined with chemotherapy versus chemotherapy (low‐quality evidence), BRAF inhibitors versus chemotherapy (low‐quality evidence), and BRAF plus MEK inhibitors versus BRAF inhibitors alone (moderate‐quality evidence). We also conducted an analysis that compared treatments that had not been directly compared in a study. This is known as a network meta‐analysis. For the outcome of progression��free survival, looking at only the best evidence available, we found the following results (please note that because the highest quality level was moderate, the following results can only be deemed probable): • both combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors and combination of small‐molecule targeted drugs were favoured compared to chemotherapy; • both BRAF inhibitors and combination of small‐molecule targeted drugs were favoured compared to anti‐CTLA4 monoclonal antibodies; • biochemotherapy led to less favourable results than BRAF inhibitors; • the combination of small‐molecule targeted drugs was favoured compared to anti‐PD1 monoclonal antibodies; • both biochemotherapy and MEK inhibitors led to less favourable results than the combination of small‐molecule targeted drugs; and • biochemotherapy led to less favourable results than the combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors For the outcome of toxicity, looking at only the best evidence available, we found the following results (again, evidence quality was no higher than moderate): • combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors led to less favourable results than chemotherapy; • combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors led to less favourable results than BRAF inhibitors; • the combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors led to less favourable results than anti‐PD1 monoclonal antibodies; and • biochemotherapy was favoured compared to the combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Our results suggest that the combination of small‐molecule targeted drugs (BRAF plus MEK inhibitors) is the most effective treatment strategy, for people with melanoma that has a BRAF gene change, at least in terms of progression‐free survival; however, this combination therapy is burdened by a higher rate of severe toxicity compared to effects observed among people treated with anti‐PD1 monoclonal antibodies, which can be used in all melanoma types, and rank highest in terms of tolerability. These results need long‐term analysis from randomised trials to be confirmed, with special attention to effects on patients' overall survival. Quality of the evidence GRADE findings showed that most evidence was high‐ to moderate‐quality for three (overall survival, progression‐free survival and tumour response) out of four outcomes (toxicity). Evidence quality was reduced due to small numbers of participants in some comparisons, differences between the studies, and poor reporting of trials.},

ISSN = {1465-1858},
abstract = {Abstract - Background High efficacy in terms of protection from severe COVID‐19 has been demonstrated for several SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccines. However, patients with compromised immune status develop a weaker and less stable immune response to vaccination. Strong immune response may not always translate into clinical benefit, therefore it is important to synthesise evidence on modified schemes and types of vaccination in these population subgroups for guiding health decisions. As the literature on COVID‐19 vaccines continues to expand, we aimed to scope the literature on multiple subgroups to subsequently decide on the most relevant research questions to be answered by systematic reviews. Objectives To provide an overview of the availability of existing literature on immune response and long‐term clinical outcomes after COVID‐19 vaccination, and to map this evidence according to the examined populations, specific vaccines, immunity parameters, and their way of determining relevant long‐term outcomes and the availability of mapping between immune reactivity and relevant outcomes. Search methods We searched the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register, the Web of Science Core Collection, and the World Health Organization COVID‐19 Global literature on coronavirus disease on 6 December 2021.  Selection criteria We included studies that published results on immunity outcomes after vaccination with BNT162b2, mRNA‐1273, AZD1222, Ad26.COV2.S, Sputnik V or Sputnik Light, BBIBP‐CorV, or CoronaVac on predefined vulnerable subgroups such as people with malignancies, transplant recipients, people undergoing renal replacement therapy, and people with immune disorders, as well as pregnant and breastfeeding women, and children. We included studies if they had at least 100 participants (not considering healthy control groups); we excluded case studies and case series. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently and in duplicate onto an online data extraction form. Data were represented as tables and as online maps to show the frequency of studies for each item. We mapped the data according to study design, country of participant origin, patient comorbidity subgroup, intervention, outcome domains (clinical, safety, immunogenicity), and outcomes.  Main results Out of 25,452 identified records, 318 studies with a total of more than 5 million participants met our eligibility criteria and were included in the review. Participants were recruited mainly from high‐income countries between January 2020 and 31 October 2021 (282/318); the majority of studies included adult participants (297/318).  Haematological malignancies were the most commonly examined comorbidity group (N = 54), followed by solid tumours (N = 47), dialysis (N = 48), kidney transplant (N = 43), and rheumatic diseases (N = 28, 17, and 15 for mixed diseases, multiple sclerosis, and inflammatory bowel disease, respectively). Thirty‐one studies included pregnant or breastfeeding women. The most commonly administered vaccine was BNT162b2 (N = 283), followed by mRNA‐1273 (N = 153), AZD1222 (N = 66), Ad26.COV2.S (N = 42), BBIBP‐CorV (N = 15), CoronaVac (N = 14), and Sputnik V (N = 5; no studies were identified for Sputnik Light). Most studies reported outcomes after regular vaccination scheme.  The majority of studies focused on immunogenicity outcomes, especially seroconversion based on binding antibody measurements and immunoglobulin G (IgG) titres (N = 179 and 175, respectively). Adverse events and serious adverse events were reported in 126 and 54 studies, whilst SARS‐CoV‐2 infection irrespective of severity was reported in 80 studies. Mortality due to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection was reported in 36 studies. Please refer to our  evidence gap maps  for more detailed information. Authors' conclusions Up to 6 December 2021, the majority of studies examined data on mRNA vaccines administered as standard vaccination schemes (two doses approximately four to eight weeks apart) that report on immunogenicity parameters or adverse events. Clinical outcomes were less commonly reported, and if so, were often reported as a secondary outcome observed in seroconversion or immunoglobulin titre studies. As informed by this scoping review, two effectiveness reviews (on haematological malignancies and kidney transplant recipients) are currently being conducted. Plain language summary Immunity in vulnerable groups after COVID‐19 vaccination What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out which studies on the most commonly used COVID‐19 vaccines in vulnerable subgroups have been published, and which outcomes were reported (e.g. effectiveness outcomes, safety, or immune response), to decide on the most relevant questions and answer these in further effectiveness systematic reviews (syntheses of the medical literature). What did we do? We searched medical databases and trial registries for studies on COVID‐19 vaccines that were authorised for use in the European Union (European Medicines Agency (EMA)‐approved) and those approved in at least 10 countries worldwide at the time of our search. We included studies on additional conditions (comorbidities) that can reduce the immune reaction to vaccination, if they had more than 100 participants; they could include any age, sex, ethnicity, or country of recruitment. We excluded studies looking at the general population and other than preselected COVID‐19 vaccines and subgroups.  Once we found the studies, we categorised the vaccines into the following groups: EMA‐approved COVID‐19 vaccines, other COVID‐19 vaccines, and schemes with different COVID‐19 vaccines. We summarised the results in an interactive online map. We mapped the study outcomes, the country in which the study was conducted, the study design, and the vulnerable population. What did we find? We included 318 studies. Most studies came from high‐income countries and included adults. We found that haematological malignancies (cancers that affect the blood, bone marrow, and lymph nodes) and solid tumours were examined in many studies, followed by people receiving dialysis and kidney transplants, rheumatic diseases, and others. Thirty‐one studies included pregnant or breastfeeding women. The majority of studies explored mRNA vaccines (N = 283 and N = 153 for BNT162b2 and mRNA‐1273) at two doses, and EMA‐approved vaccines were more commonly administered than other vaccines and schemes with different COVID‐19 vaccines.  Outcomes related to immunogenicity (how well a vaccine works, or the ability to stimulate the development of antibodies), especially the presence or absence of antibodies in the blood of patients or an estimate for the amount of these antibodies, were the most frequently reported outcome in more than 170 studies each. In addition, adverse events were assessed often (N = 126 studies), whilst SARS‐CoV‐2 infection was reported in only 80 studies. What are the limitations of the evidence? Due to the quick development of the pandemic, the research landscape may have changed. The newer Omicron variant has become the dominant variant, and a new vaccine has been approved by the EMA, which is not covered by our search. How up‐to‐date is this evidence? The evidence is up‐to‐date to December 2021. What are the next steps? Based on the overview from this review, we have decided to conduct two detailed systematic reviews on haematological malignancies and kidney transplant recipients.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Automated telephone communication systems (ATCS) can deliver voice messages and collect health‐related information from patients using either their telephone's touch‐tone keypad or voice recognition software. ATCS can supplement or replace telephone contact between health professionals and patients. There are four different types of ATCS: unidirectional (one‐way, non‐interactive voice communication), interactive voice response (IVR) systems, ATCS with additional functions such as access to an expert to request advice (ATCS Plus) and multimodal ATCS, where the calls are delivered as part of a multicomponent intervention. Objectives To assess the effects of ATCS for preventing disease and managing long‐term conditions on behavioural change, clinical, process, cognitive, patient‐centred and adverse outcomes. Search methods We searched 10 electronic databases (the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; MEDLINE; Embase; PsycINFO; CINAHL; Global Health; WHOLIS; LILACS; Web of Science; and ASSIA); three grey literature sources (Dissertation Abstracts, Index to Theses, Australasian Digital Theses); and two trial registries (www.controlled‐trials.com; www.clinicaltrials.gov) for papers published between 1980 and June 2015. Selection criteria Randomised, cluster‐ and quasi‐randomised trials, interrupted time series and controlled before‐and‐after studies comparing ATCS interventions, with any control or another ATCS type were eligible for inclusion. Studies in all settings, for all consumers/carers, in any preventive healthcare or long term condition management role were eligible. Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane methods to select and extract data and to appraise eligible studies. Main results We included 132 trials (N = 4,669,689). Studies spanned across several clinical areas, assessing many comparisons based on evaluation of different ATCS types and variable comparison groups. Forty‐one studies evaluated ATCS for delivering preventive healthcare, 84 for managing long‐term conditions, and seven studies for appointment reminders. We downgraded our certainty in the evidence primarily because of the risk of bias for many outcomes. We judged the risk of bias arising from allocation processes to be low for just over half the studies and unclear for the remainder. We considered most studies to be at unclear risk of performance or detection bias due to blinding, while only 16% of studies were at low risk. We generally judged the risk of bias due to missing data and selective outcome reporting to be unclear. For preventive healthcare, ATCS (ATCS Plus, IVR, unidirectional) probably increase immunisation uptake in children (risk ratio (RR) 1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.18 to 1.32; 5 studies, N = 10,454; moderate certainty) and to a lesser extent in adolescents (RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.11; 2 studies, N = 5725; moderate certainty). The effects of ATCS in adults are unclear (RR 2.18, 95% CI 0.53 to 9.02; 2 studies, N = 1743; very low certainty). For screening, multimodal ATCS increase uptake of screening for breast cancer (RR 2.17, 95% CI 1.55 to 3.04; 2 studies, N = 462; high certainty) and colorectal cancer (CRC) (RR 2.19, 95% CI 1.88 to 2.55; 3 studies, N = 1013; high certainty) versus usual care. It may also increase osteoporosis screening. ATCS Plus interventions probably slightly increase cervical cancer screening (moderate certainty), but effects on osteoporosis screening are uncertain. IVR systems probably increase CRC screening at 6 months (RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.48; 2 studies, N = 16,915; moderate certainty) but not at 9 to 12 months, with probably little or no effect of IVR (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.99, 1.11; 2 studies, 2599 participants; moderate certainty) or unidirectional ATCS on breast cancer screening. Appointment reminders delivered through IVR or unidirectional ATCS may improve attendance rates compared with no calls (low certainty). For long‐term management, medication or laboratory test adherence provided the most general evidence across conditions (25 studies, data not combined). Multimodal ATCS versus usual care showed conflicting effects (positive and uncertain) on medication adherence. ATCS Plus probably slightly (versus control; moderate certainty) or probably (versus usual care; moderate certainty) improves medication adherence but may have little effect on adherence to tests (versus control). IVR probably slightly improves medication adherence versus control (moderate certainty). Compared with usual care, IVR probably improves test adherence and slightly increases medication adherence up to six months but has little or no effect at longer time points (moderate certainty). Unidirectional ATCS, compared with control, may have little effect or slightly improve medication adherence (low certainty). The evidence suggested little or no consistent effect of any ATCS type on clinical outcomes (blood pressure control, blood lipids, asthma control, therapeutic coverage) related to adherence, but only a small number of studies contributed clinical outcome data. The above results focus on areas with the most general findings across conditions. In condition‐specific areas, the effects of ATCS varied, including by the type of ATCS intervention in use. Multimodal ATCS probably decrease both cancer pain and chronic pain as well as depression (moderate certainty), but other ATCS types were less effective. Depending on the type of intervention, ATCS may have small effects on outcomes for physical activity, weight management, alcohol consumption, and diabetes mellitus. ATCS have little or no effect on outcomes related to heart failure, hypertension, mental health or smoking cessation, and there is insufficient evidence to determine their effects for preventing alcohol/substance misuse or managing illicit drug addiction, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, HIV/AIDS, hypercholesterolaemia, obstructive sleep apnoea, spinal cord dysfunction or psychological stress in carers. Only four trials (3%) reported adverse events, and it was unclear whether these were related to the interventions. Authors' conclusions ATCS interventions can change patients' health behaviours, improve clinical outcomes and increase healthcare uptake with positive effects in several important areas including immunisation, screening, appointment attendance, and adherence to medications or tests. The decision to integrate ATCS interventions in routine healthcare delivery should reflect variations in the certainty of the evidence available and the size of effects across different conditions, together with the varied nature of ATCS interventions assessed. Future research should investigate both the content of ATCS interventions and the mode of delivery; users' experiences, particularly with regard to acceptability; and clarify which ATCS types are most effective and cost‐effective. Plain language summary Automated telephone communication systems for preventing disease and managing long‐term conditions Background Automated telephone communication systems (ATCS) send voice messages and collect health information from people using their telephone's touch‐tone keypad or voice recognition software. This could replace or supplement telephone contact between health professionals and patients. There are several types of ATCS: one‐way voice messages to patients (unidirectional), interactive voice response (IVR) systems, those with added functions like referral to advice (ATCS Plus), or those where ATCS are part of a complex intervention (multimodal). Review question This review assessed the effectiveness of ATCS for preventing disease and managing long‐term conditions. Results We found 132 trials with over 4 million participants across preventive healthcare areas and for the management of long‐term conditions. Studies compared ATCS types in many ways. Some studies reported findings across diseases. For prevention, ATCS probably increase immunisation uptake in children, and slightly in adolescents, but in adults effects are uncertain. Also for prevention, multimodal ATCS increase numbers of people screened for breast or colorectal cancers, and may increase osteoporosis screening. ATCS Plus probably slightly increases attendance for cervical cancer screening, with uncertain effects on osteoporosis screening. IVR probably increases the numbers screened for colorectal cancer up to six months, with little effect on breast cancer screening. ATCS (unidirectional or IVR) may improve appointment attendance, key to both preventing and managing disease. For long‐term management, multimodal ATCS had inconsistent effects on medication adherence. ATCS Plus probably improves medication adherence versus usual care. Compared with control, ATCS Plus and IVR probably slightly improve adherence, while unidirectional ATCS may have little, or slightly positive, effects. No intervention consistently improved clinical outcomes. IVR probably improves test adherence, but ATCS Plus may have little effect. ATCS were also used in specific conditions. Effects varied by condition and ATCS type. Multimodal ATCS, but not other ATCS types, probably decrease cancer pain and chronic pain. Outcomes may improve to a small degree when ATCS are applied to physical activity, weight management, alcohol use and diabetes.However, there is little or no effect in heart failure, hypertension, mental health or quitting smoking. In several areas (alcohol/substance misuse, addiction, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, HIV/AIDS, high cholesterol, obstructive sleep apnoea, spinal cord dysfunction, carers' psychological stress), there is not enough evidence to tell what effects ATCS have. Only four trials reported adverse events. Our certainty in the evidence varied (high to very low), and was often lowered because of study limitations, meaning that further research may change some findings. Conclusion ATCS may be promising for changing certain health behaviours, improving health outcomes and increasing healthcare uptake.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Recipients of allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCT) can develop acute or chronic, or both forms of graft‐versus‐host disease (a/cGvHD), whereby immune cells of the donor attack host tissues. Steroids are the primary treatment, but patients with severe, refractory disease have limited options and a poor prognosis. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) exhibit immunosuppressive properties and are being tested in clinical trials for their safety and efficacy in treating many immune‐mediated disorders. GvHD is one of the first areas in which MSCs were clinically applied, and it is important that the accumulating evidence is systematically reviewed to assess whether their use is favoured. Objectives To determine the evidence for the safety and efficacy of MSCs for treating immune‐mediated inflammation post‐transplantation of haematopoietic stem cells. Search methods We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, the Cochrane Library 2018, Issue 12), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), CINAHL (from 1937), Web of Science: Conference Proceedings Citation Index‐Science (CPCI‐S) (from 1990) and ongoing trial databases to 6 December 2018. No constraints were placed on language or publication status. Selection criteria We included RCTs of participants with a haematological condition who have undergone an HSCT as treatment for their condition and were randomised to MSCs (intervention arm) or no MSCs (comparator arm), to prevent or treat GvHD. We also included RCTs which compared different doses of MSCs or MSCs of different sources (e.g. bone marrow versus cord). We included MSCs co‐transplanted with haematopoietic stem cells as well as MSCs administered post‐transplantation of haematopoietic stem cells. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We employed a random‐effects model for all analyses due to expected clinical heterogeneity arising from differences in participant characteristics and interventions. Main results We identified 12 completed RCTs (879 participants), and 13 ongoing trials (1532 enrolled participants planned). Of 12 completed trials, 10 compared MSCs versus no MSCs and two compared different doses of MSCs. One trial was in people with thalassaemia major, the remaining trials were for haematological malignancies. Seven trials administered MSCs to prevent GvHD, whereas five trials gave MSCs to treat GvHD. In the comparison of MSCs with no MSCs, cells were administered at a dose of between 10 5  and 10 7  cells/kg in either a single dose (six trials) or in multiple doses (four trials) over a period of three days to four months. The dose‐comparison trials compared 2 x 10 6  cells/kg with 8 x 10 6  cells/kg in two infusions, or 1 x 10 6  cells/kg with 3 x 10 6  cells/kg in a single infusion. The median duration of follow‐up in seven trials which administered MSCs prophylactically ranged from 10 to 60 months. In three trials of MSCs as treatment for aGvHD, participants were followed up for 90 or 100 days. In two trials of MSCs as treatment for cGvHD, the mean duration of follow‐up was 13.4 months (MSC group) and 23.6 months (control group) in one trial, and 56 weeks in the second trial. Five trials included adults only, six trials included adults and children, and one trial included children only. In eight trials which reported the gender distribution, the percentage of females ranged from 20% to 59% (median 35.8%). The overall quality of the included studies was low: randomisation methods were poorly reported and several of the included studies were subject to a high risk of performance bias and reporting bias. One trial which started in 2008 has not been published and the progress of this trial in unknown, leading to potential publication bias. The quality of evidence was therefore low or very low for all outcomes due to a high risk of bias as well as imprecision due to the low number of overall participants, and in some cases evidence based on a single study. We found that MSCs may make little or no difference in the risk of all‐cause mortality in either prophylactic trials (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.42; participants = 301; studies = 5; I 2  = 34% ; low‐quality evidence) or therapeutic trials (HR 1.12, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.56; participants = 244; studies = 1; very low‐quality evidence), and no difference in the risk of relapse of malignant disease (prophylactic trials: RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.59; participants = 323; studies = 6; I 2  = 0%; low‐quality evidence) compared with no MSCs. MSCs were well‐tolerated, no infusion‐related toxicity or ectopic tissue formation was reported. No study reported health‐related quality of life. In prophylactic trials, MSCs may reduce the risk of chronic GvHD (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.89; participants = 283; studies = 6; I 2  = 0%; low‐quality evidence). This means that only 310 (95% CI 230 to 418) in every 1000 patients in the MSC arm are expected to develop chronic GvHD compared to 469 in the control arm. However, MSCs may make little or no difference to the risk of aGvHD (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.17; participants = 247; studies = 6; I 2  = 0%; low‐quality evidence). In GvHD therapeutic trials, we are very uncertain whether MSCs improve complete response of either aGvHD (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.70, participants = 260, studies = 1; very low‐quality evidence) or cGvHD (RR 5.00, 95%CI 0.75 to 33.21, participants = 40, studies = 1; very low‐quality evidence). In two trials which compared different doses of MSCs, we found no evidence of any differences in outcomes. Authors' conclusions MSCs are an area of intense research activity, and an increasing number of trials have been undertaken or are planned. Despite a number of reports of positive outcomes from the use of MSCs for treating acute GvHD, the evidence to date from RCTs has not supported the conclusion that they are an effective therapy. There is low‐quality evidence that MSCs may reduce the risk of cGvHD. New trial evidence will be incorporated into future updates of this review, which may better establish a role for MSCs in the prevention or treatment of GvHD. Plain language summary Mesenchymal stromal cells to treat or prevent graft‐versus‐host disease in stem cell transplant recipients Review question In people who receive a stem cell transplant for a haematological condition, can an additional infusion of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) prevent the development of graft‐versus‐host disease (GvHD)? In people who have already developed GvHD as a result of their stem cell transplant, can MSCs improve their clinical outcome? Background Patients with leukaemia or other blood disorders may be treated with blood stem cells from another person, but the immune cells in the graft can attack their tissues in a serious complication referred to as graft‐versus‐host disease (GvHD). Steroids are the standard treatment for GvHD, but if they are unable stop the damage then treatment options are limited. In order to look for potential new treatments, a number of hospitals around the world have investigated the use of MSCs for inhibiting GvHD. MSCs are a type of cell that can develop into connective tissue (e.g. bone or cartilage), but they have also been found to have anti‐inflammatory properties. For clinical trials, MSCs have been isolated from different tissue sources (e.g. bone marrow, fat, or umbilical cords) and then grown in large numbers in the laboratory. The MSC preparations are then injected intravenously into the patient at the time they have their stem cell transplant or afterward, either to prevent GvHD (prophylaxis) or to treat ongoing disease. For patients being treated for GvHD, is treatment with MSCs safe and effective against complications of inflammation associated with GvHD? Study characteristics The evidence is current to 6 December 2018. We identified 12 studies and 13 ongoing trials. Ten studies compared MSCs with a control group, and two studies compared different doses of MSCs. Five trials included only adults, whereas six trials include both adults and children and one trial was exclusively performed in children. Of the 12 completed trials, one trial was in people with inherited blood disorders (thalassaemia major), and 11 trials were in people with blood cancers. In seven trials, MSCs were given to prevent GvHD, whereas in five trials, MSCs were given to people who had already developed GvHD. MSCs were derived from umbilical cord in two trials, bone marrow in seven trials and adipose tissue in one trial; in two trials the origin of MSCs was unknown. In the comparison of MSCs with no MSCs, cells were administered at a dose of between 10 5  and 10 7  cells/kg. Seven trials gave MSCs in a single dose, whereas five trials gave multiple doses of MSCs. Trial participants were followed up for between 10 and 60 months, or in those who had already developed GvHD, up to two years. Three trials were funded and carried out by a commercial manufacturer, using their cultured mesenchymal stromal cells known as Prochymal. All trials included both men and women. Key results MSCs may have little or no difference in the risk of death or relapse of malignant disease, in either GvHD prevention or treatment trials, as the quality of evidence was low. MSCs were well‐tolerated, no infusion‐related toxicity or ectopic tissue formation was reported. No study reported health‐related quality‐of‐life. In trials where MSCs were administered to prevent GvHD, MSCs may reduce the risk of developing chronic GvHD, but may make little or no difference to the risk of developing acute GvHD. In GvHD treatment trials, we are very uncertain whether MSCs improve complete response of either acute or chronic GvHD as the quality of evidence is very low. We found no differences in outcomes between participants who received a higher dose of MSCs when compared with those who received a lower dose of MSCs. Quality of the evidence The quality of evidence is low or very low for all outcome measures, due to the small number of trials and low number of study participants included in this review. One trial started in 2008, but its results are unknown as it is not yet published. It is therefore difficult to draw conclusions or provide recommendations on the use of MSCs, either to prevent or treat GvHD. More trials with large numbers of study participants are needed to improve the quality of evidence.},

ISSN = {1465-1858},
abstract = {Abstract - Background Surgeons who perform laparotomy have a number of decisions to make regarding abdominal closure. Material and size of potential suture types varies widely. In addition, surgeons can choose to close the incision in anatomic layers or mass ('en masse'), as well as using either a continuous or interrupted suturing technique, of which there are different styles of each. There is ongoing debate as to which suturing techniques and suture materials are best for achieving definitive wound closure while minimising the risk of short‐ and long‐term complications. Objectives The objectives of this review were to identify the best available suture techniques and suture materials for closure of the fascia following laparotomy incisions, by assessing the following comparisons: absorbable versus non‐absorbable sutures; mass versus layered closure; continuous versus interrupted closure techniques; monofilament versus multifilament sutures; and slow absorbable versus fast absorbable sutures. Our objective was not to determine the single best combination of suture material and techniques, but to compare the individual components of abdominal closure. Search methods On 8 February 2017 we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two trials registries, and Science Citation Index. There were no limitations based on language or date of publication. We searched the reference lists of all included studies to identify trials that our searches may have missed. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared suture materials or closure techniques, or both, for fascial closure of laparotomy incisions. We excluded trials that compared only types of skin closures, peritoneal closures or use of retention sutures. Data collection and analysis We abstracted data and assessed the risk of bias for each trial. We calculated a summary risk ratio (RR) for the outcomes assessed in the review, all of which were dichotomous. We used random‐effects modelling, based on the heterogeneity seen throughout the studies and analyses. We completed subgroup analysis planned a priori for each outcome, excluding studies where interventions being compared differed by more than one component, making it impossible to determine which variable impacted on the outcome, or the possibility of a synergistic effect. We completed sensitivity analysis, excluding trials with at least one trait with high risk of bias. We assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADEpro guidelines. Main results Fifty‐five RCTs with a total of 19,174 participants met the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta‐analysis. Included studies were heterogeneous in the type of sutures used, methods of closure and patient population. Many of the included studies reported multiple comparisons. For our primary outcome, the proportion of participants who developed incisional hernia at one year or more of follow‐up, we did not find evidence that suture absorption (absorbable versus non‐absorbable sutures, RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.32, moderate‐quality evidence; or slow versus fast absorbable sutures, RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.06, moderate‐quality evidence), closure method (mass versus layered, RR 1.92, 95% CI 0.58 to 6.35, very low‐quality evidence) or closure technique (continuous versus interrupted, RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.35, moderate‐quality evidence) resulted in a difference in the risk of incisional hernia. We did, however, find evidence to suggest that monofilament sutures reduced the risk of incisional hernia when compared with multifilament sutures (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.98, I 2  = 30%, moderate‐quality evidence). For our secondary outcomes, we found that none of the interventions reduced the risk of wound infection, whether based on suture absorption (absorbable versus non‐absorbable sutures, RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.17, moderate‐quality evidence; or slow versus fast absorbable sutures, RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.57, moderate‐quality evidence), closure method (mass versus layered, RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.30, low‐quality evidence) or closure technique (continuous versus interrupted, RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.34, moderate‐quality evidence). Similarily, none of the interventions reduced the risk of wound dehiscence whether based on suture absorption (absorbable versus non‐absorbable sutures, RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.10, moderate‐quality evidence; or slow versus fast absorbable sutures, RR 1.55, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.61, moderate‐quality evidence), closure method (mass versus layered, RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.52, moderate‐quality evidence) or closure technique (continuous versus interrupted, RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.64, moderate‐quality evidence). Absorbable sutures, compared with non‐absorbable sutures (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.94, low‐quality evidence) reduced the risk of sinus or fistula tract formation. None of the other comparisons showed a difference (slow versus fast absorbable sutures, RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.05 to 16.05, very low‐quality evidence; mass versus layered, RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.62, low‐quality evidence; continuous versus interrupted, RR 1.51, 95% CI 0.64 to 3.61, very low‐quality evidence). Authors' conclusions Based on this moderate‐quality body of evidence, monofilament sutures may reduce the risk of incisional hernia. Absorbable sutures may also reduce the risk of sinus or fistula tract formation, but this finding is based on low‐quality evidence. We had serious concerns about the design or reporting of several of the 55 included trials. The comparator arms in many trials differed by more than one component, making it impossible to attribute differences between groups to any one component. In addition, the patient population included in many of the studies was very heterogeneous. Trials included both emergency and elective cases, different types of disease pathology (e.g. colon surgery, hepatobiliary surgery, etc.) or different types of incisions (e.g. midline, paramedian, subcostal). Consequently, larger, high‐quality trials to further address this clinical challenge are warranted. Future studies should ensure that proper randomisation and allocation techniques are performed, wound assessors are blinded, and that the duration of follow‐up is adequate. It is important that only one type of intervention is compared between groups. In addition, a homogeneous patient population would allow for a more accurate assessment of the interventions. Plain language summary What is the best way to close abdominal incisions following surgery? What is the Issue? Laparotomy, an incision through the abdominal wall to access the abdominal cavity, is performed for a variety of surgical procedures. Incisional hernia, infection, dehiscence (an opening of the wound or muscle layers) and chronic drainage from the wound, are potential complications of this procedure. Why is it Important? Incisional hernias affect up to 20% of people undergoing a laparotomy. Incisional hernias, as they enlarge over time, cause patient discomfort, which in turn, result in patients restricting their work and other physical activities. Cosmetic concerns may also arise. We asked: Does the type of suture material, or type of closure prevent these complications? We compared absorbable sutures (sutures that lose their tensile strength as they are dissolved by the patient's body) versus non‐absorbable (permanent) sutures; mass closure (closure of all anatomical layers of abdominal wall at once) versus layered closure (closing the anatomic layers individually); continuous closure (running suture) versus interrupted closure; monofilament sutures versus multifilament (braided) sutures; and slow absorbable sutures (those that maintain their tensile strength for more than 30 days) versus fast absorbable sutures (those that lose their tensile strength within 30 days). We found: A search of all relevant publications (up to date as of 8 February 2017) found a total of 55 studies with 19,174 participants to include in the review. The included studies differed greatly in the type of suture materials used, the closure technique and the type of underlying surgical procedures performed. We found that using monofilament sutures reduced the occurrence of incisional hernia. Absorbable sutures reduced the risk of chronic drainage from the wound (sinus or fistula formation). This review included a notably large number of trials; however, we had concerns regarding their collective methodological design and scientific reporting. This means: Monofilament sutures can be considered for abdominal closure to reduce the risk of incisional hernia. Absorbable sutures can be considered to reduce the risk of chronic drainage from the wound.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Collaborative writing applications (CWAs), such as wikis and Google Documents, hold the potential to improve the use of evidence in both public health and healthcare. Although a growing body of literature indicates that CWAs could have positive effects on healthcare, such as improved collaboration, behavioural change, learning, knowledge management, and adaptation of knowledge to local context, this has never been assessed systematically. Moreover, several questions regarding safety, reliability, and legal aspects exist. Objectives The objectives of this review were to (1) assess the effects of the use of CWAs on process (including the behaviour of healthcare professionals) and patient outcomes, (2) critically appraise and summarise current evidence on the use of resources, costs, and cost‐effectiveness associated with CWAs to improve professional practices and patient outcomes, and (3) explore the effects of different CWA features (e.g. open versus closed) and different implementation factors (e.g. the presence of a moderator) on process and patient outcomes. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and 11 other electronic databases. We searched the grey literature, two trial registries, CWA websites, individual journals, and conference proceedings. We also contacted authors and experts in the field. We did not apply date or language limits. We searched for published literature to August 2016, and grey literature to September 2015. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), non‐randomised controlled trials (NRCTs), controlled before‐and‐after (CBA) studies, interrupted time series (ITS) studies, and repeated measures studies (RMS), in which CWAs were used as an intervention to improve the process of care, patient outcomes, or healthcare costs. Data collection and analysis Teams of two review authors independently assessed the eligibility of studies. Disagreements were resolved by discussion, and when consensus was not reached, a third review author was consulted. Main results We screened 11,993 studies identified from the electronic database searches and 346 studies from grey literature sources. We analysed the full text of 99 studies. None of the studies met the eligibility criteria; two potentially relevant studies are ongoing. Authors' conclusions While there is a high number of published studies about CWAs, indicating that this is an active field of research, additional studies using rigorous experimental designs are needed to assess their impact and cost‐effectiveness on process and patient outcomes. Plain language summary Collaborative writing applications to support the implementation of best practices in healthcare. What is the aim of this review? The aim of this Cochrane review was to find out whether collaborative writing applications (CWAs), also known as collaborative writing tools, could improve the way health professionals work, and improve patients’ health. Another goal of our study was to examine the costs and resources needed to use CWAs. Finally, we wanted to know if certain CWA features (for example, being open, like Wikipedia, versus being closed, like the Canadian CPOE toolkit), and different clinical practice change factors (for example, the presence of a moderator) increased the CWAs' impact on healthcare. We searched for studies to answer these questions. Key messages We did not identify any studies that measured the effect of CWAs on how healthcare professionals care for their patients. What was studied in this review? When people receive healthcare, it is important that they are treated according to best practices. However, decision makers, health professionals, researchers, and patients need tools to support best practices. Collaborative writing applications are a new category of information and communication technologies that allow multiple individuals to share, create, and revise online documents at the same time. They could help implement best practices in healthcare. Collaborative writing applications could also help adapt online documents to local contexts. This could help reduce duplication and waste of resources. The most widely known example of a CWA is Wikipedia, the online encyclopaedia. However, there are many other examples of CWAs (e.g. WikEM, WikiDoc, Canadian CPOE toolkit, WikiTrauma). Despite the fact that CWAs are promising tools, it is not yet known if they improve how healthcare professionals care for their patients. What are the main results of the review? We searched 14 scientific bibliographic databases, two trial registries, and grey literature sources. We also contacted 106 authors and experts in the field to ask for relevant papers. No studies met our eligibility criteria; two potentially relevant studies are ongoing. How up to date is this review? We searched for evidence to August 2016.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background A glioblastoma is a fatal type of brain tumour for which the standard of care is maximum surgical resection followed by chemoradiotherapy, when possible. Age is an important consideration in this disease, as older age is associated with shorter survival and a higher risk of treatment‐related toxicity. Objectives To determine the most effective and best‐tolerated approaches for the treatment of elderly people with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. To summarise current evidence for the incremental resource use, utilities, costs and cost‐effectiveness associated with these approaches. Search methods We searched electronic databases including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and Embase to 3 April 2019, and the NHS Economic Evaluation Database (EED) up to database closure. We handsearched clinical trial registries and selected neuro‐oncology society conference proceedings from the past five years. Selection criteria Randomised trials (RCTs) of treatments for glioblastoma in elderly people. We defined ‘elderly' as 70+ years but included studies defining ‘elderly' as over 65+ years if so reported. Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane methods for study selection and data extraction. Where sufficient data were available, treatment options were compared in a network meta‐analysis (NMA) using Stata software (version 15.1). For outcomes with insufficient data for NMA, pairwise meta‐analysis were conducted in RevMan. The GRADE approach was used to grade the evidence. Main results We included 12 RCTs involving approximately 1818 participants. Six were conducted exclusively among elderly people (either defined as 65 years or older or 70 years or older) with newly diagnosed glioblastoma, the other six reported data for an elderly subgroup among a broader age range of participants. Most participants were capable of self‐care. Study quality was commonly undermined by lack of outcome assessor blinding and attrition. NMA was only possible for overall survival; other analyses were pair‐wise meta‐analyses or narrative syntheses. Seven trials contributed to the NMA for overall survival, with interventions including supportive care only (one trial arm); hypofractionated radiotherapy (RT40; four trial arms); standard radiotherapy (RT60; five trial arms); temozolomide (TMZ; three trial arms); chemoradiotherapy (CRT; three trial arms); bevacizumab with chemoradiotherapy (BEV_CRT; one trial arm); and bevacizumab with radiotherapy (BEV_RT). Compared with supportive care only, NMA evidence suggested that all treatments apart from BEV_RT prolonged survival to some extent. Overall survival High‐certainty evidence shows that CRT prolongs overall survival (OS) compared with RT40 (hazard ratio (HR) 0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.56 to 0.80) and low‐certainty evidence suggests that CRT may prolong overall survival compared with TMZ (TMZ versus CRT: HR 1.42, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.98). Low‐certainty evidence also suggests that adding BEV to CRT may make little or no difference (BEV_CRT versus CRT: HR 0.83, 95% CrI 0.48 to 1.44). We could not compare the survival effects of CRT with different radiotherapy fractionation schedules (60 Gy/30 fractions and 40 Gy/15 fractions) due to a lack of data. When treatments were ranked according to their effects on OS, CRT ranked higher than TMZ, RT and supportive care only, with the latter ranked last. BEV plus RT was the only treatment for which there was no clear benefit in OS over supportive care only.   One trial comparing tumour treating fields (TTF) plus adjuvant chemotherapy (TTF_AC) with adjuvant chemotherapy alone could not be included in the NMA as participants were randomised after receiving concomitant chemoradiotherapy, not before. Findings from the trial suggest that the intervention probably improves overall survival in this selected patient population. We were unable to perform NMA for other outcomes due to insufficient data. Pairwise analyses were conducted for the following. Quality of life Moderate‐certainty narrative evidence suggests that overall, there may be little difference in QoL between TMZ and RT, except for discomfort from communication deficits, which are probably more common with RT (1 study, 306 participants, P = 0.002). Data on QoL for other comparisons were sparse, partly due to high dropout rates, and the certainty of the evidence tended to be low or very low. Progression‐free survival High‐certainty evidence shows that CRT increases time to disease progression compared with RT40 (HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.61); moderate‐certainty evidence suggests that RT60 probably increases time to disease progression compared with supportive care only (HR 0.28, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.46), and that BEV_RT probably increases time to disease progression compared with RT40 alone (HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.78). Evidence for other treatment comparisons was of low‐ or very low‐certainty. Severe adverse events Moderate‐certainty evidence suggests that TMZ probably increases the risk of grade 3+ thromboembolic events compared with RT60 (risk ratio (RR) 2.74, 95% CI 1.26 to 5.94; participants = 373; studies = 1) and also the risk of grade 3+ neutropenia, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Moderate‐certainty evidence also suggests that CRT probably increases the risk of grade 3+ neutropenia, leucopenia and thrombocytopenia compared with hypofractionated RT alone. Adding BEV to CRT probably increases the risk of thromboembolism (RR 16.63, 95% CI 1.00 to 275.42; moderate‐certainty evidence). Economic evidence There is a paucity of economic evidence regarding the management of newly diagnosed glioblastoma in the elderly. Only one economic evaluation on two short course radiotherapy regimen (25 Gy versus 40 Gy) was identified and its findings were considered unreliable. Authors' conclusions For elderly people with glioblastoma who are self‐caring, evidence suggests that CRT prolongs survival compared with RT and may prolong overall survival compared with TMZ alone. For those undergoing RT or TMZ therapy, there is probably little difference in QoL overall. Systemic anti‐cancer treatments TMZ and BEV carry a higher risk of severe haematological and thromboembolic events and CRT is probably associated with a higher risk of these events. Current evidence provides little justification for using BEV in elderly patients outside a clinical trial setting. Whilst the novel TTF device appears promising, evidence on QoL and tolerability is needed in an elderly population. QoL and economic assessments of CRT versus TMZ and RT are needed. More high‐quality economic evaluations are needed, in which a broader scope of costs (both direct and indirect) and outcomes should be included. Plain language summary Treatment options for newly diagnosed glioblastoma in older people What is the issue?   Glioblastoma is a fatal type of brain tumour. The standard treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma is to remove as much of the tumour as possible by operation, and then to give chemotherapy (an anti‐cancer medicine called temozolomide (TMZ)) and radiotherapy. TMZ is usually given at the same time as radiotherapy (concomitant chemotherapy), and also for about six months after radiotherapy (adjuvant chemotherapy). Together, these treatments can be called chemoradiotherapy (CRT). However, not all people, particularly the elderly, are fit enough to receive CRT, which can have serious side‐effects. In this review we evaluated evidence on different treatments that have been looked at in older people with newly diagnosed glioblastoma, to find out which treatments may help. How we conducted the review   We searched for trials that compared different treatments in elderly people with newly diagnosed glioblastoma and also for studies on cost‐effectiveness. We defined 'the elderly' as 70+ years, but also included data from patients 65+ years old if studies did not give results for the 70+ age group. We used standard Cochrane methods to assess studies and collect data. We compared treatments in a network meta‐analysis (NMA), which allowed us to rank different treatments options. What we found   We found 12 studies evaluating different options including radiotherapy, chemotherapy, supportive (palliative) care, combinations of treatments, and a medical device that is worn on the head and emits an electric field (known as tumour treating fields). Most people enrolled in these studies did not have serious disabilities. In the NMA, we compared the effects of seven treatments on patients overall survival. All treatments tested in the NMA apart from one, in which an agent called bevacizumab (BEV) was combined with radiotherapy, clearly prolonged survival compared with supportive care only. The strongest evidence we found showed that CRT leads to a longer survival time than short‐course radiotherapy only; but weaker evidence suggested that CRT also prolongs survival compared with TMZ only. When we ranked all treatments according to their effectiveness in prolonging survival time, CRT ranked higher than TMZ, RT and supportive care only, with the latter ranked last. A study of tumour treating fields could not be included in the NMA because it was conducted among fitter elderly patients who had already received part of their CRT. Evidence from this study suggested that adding tumour treating fields after radiotherapy probably improves survival in this fitter group of patients. With regard to quality of life, evidence suggested that the impact of TMZ and radiotherapy‐only treatments is probably not very different, except for greater discomfort from communication deficits with radiotherapy. Quality of life evidence was hard to interpret for other treatment options because it tended to be limited by high dropout rates, as people with glioblastoma do not live very long and may not feel like filling out questionnaires when they feel unwell. With regard to other outcomes, high‐certainty evidence showed that CRT delays disease progression compared with radiotherapy only. Evidence also suggested that adding BEV to short‐course radiotherapy probably delays disease progression, but may not improve overall survival. TMZ and BEV are more toxic to blood cells than radiotherapy and are associated with an increased risk of blood clots and blood vessel blockages (thromboembolism). Our conclusions   For reasonably fit elderly people with glioblastoma, evidence suggests that CRT prolongs survival compared with radiotherapy or TMZ alone, and that any of these three treatment options may prolong survival compared with supportive care only. Serious adverse events affecting blood components are more common with anti‐cancer medicines TMZ and BEV. There is not enough evidence on BEV to support its use in elderly people with glioblastoma outside of a research setting. More evidence is needed on how different treatments impact quality of life and health costs. Age alone is unlikely to be the best determinant of optimal treatment of older people with glioblastoma.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Chronic graft‐versus‐host disease (cGvHD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, occurring in 6% to 65% of the paediatric recipients. Currently, the therapeutic mainstay for cGvHD is treatment with corticosteroids, frequently combined with other immunosuppressive agents in people with steroid‐refractory manifestations. There is no established standard treatment for steroid‐refractory cGvHD. The therapeutic options for these patients include extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP), an immunomodulatory treatment that involves ex vivo collection of mononuclear cells from peripheral blood, exposure to the photoactive agent 8‐methoxypsoralen, ultraviolet radiation and re‐infusion of the processed cell product. The mechanisms of action of ECP are not completely understood. This is the second update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2014 and first updated in 2015. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of ECP for the management of cGvHD in children and adolescents after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2021), MEDLINE (PubMed) and Embase databases from their inception to 25 January 2021. We searched the reference lists of potentially relevant studies without any language restrictions. We searched five conference proceedings and nine clinical trial registries on 9 November 2020 and 12 November 2020, respectively. Selection criteria We aimed to include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing ECP with or without alternative treatment versus alternative treatment alone in children and adolescents with cGvHD after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently performed the study selection. We resolved disagreements in the selection of trials by consultation with a third review author. Main results We found no studies meeting the criteria for inclusion in this 2021 review update. Authors' conclusions We could not evaluate the efficacy of ECP in the treatment of cGvHD in children and adolescents after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation since the second review update again found no RCTs. Current recommendations are based on retrospective or observational studies only. Thus, ideally, ECP should be applied in the context of controlled trials only. However, performing RCTs in this population will be challenging due to the limited number of eligible participants, variable disease presentation and the lack of well‐defined response criteria. International collaboration, multicentre trials and appropriate funding for such trials will be needed. If treatment decisions based on clinical data are made in favour of ECP, recipients should be carefully monitored for beneficial and harmful effects. In addition, efforts should be made to share this information with other clinicians, for example by setting up registries for children and adolescents treated with ECP. Plain language summary Extracorporeal photopheresis treatment for chronic graft‐versus‐host disease after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation in children and adolescents Background Chronic graft‐versus‐host disease (cGvHD) is a common complication after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT; transplant of blood‐forming stem cells). Immune cells (white blood cells) from the donor recognise the recipient's cells as foreign ('non‐self'). Therefore, the transplanted immune cells attack the cells of the recipient. The main affected organs are skin, liver and gut, among others. These immune reactions may cause acute inflammation (sudden swelling) followed by chronic (long‐term) changes to organs (e.g. fibrosis; scarring of the lungs). First‐line therapy usually consists of immunosuppressive drugs (which reduce the strength of the body's immune system) in the form of corticosteroids in combination with other immunosuppressive agents in refractory cases (where the disease is resistant to treatment). These drugs are supposed to suppress the immune‐mediated attack of the patient's cells. Limited effectiveness and severe side effects of these drugs have led to several alternative approaches. Extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) is an immunomodulatory therapy (a treatment that makes changes to immune function) that involves collection of immune cells from peripheral blood outside the patient's body. These immune cells are exposed to a photoactive agent (a chemical that responds to exposure to light; e.g. 8‐methoxypsoralen) with subsequent ultraviolet‐A radiation and then re‐infused. We are not sure how this affects immune function. Several current clinical practice recommendations suggest consideration of ECP in children and adolescents with cGvHD. Study characteristics We searched scientific databases for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that were designed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of ECP for the management of chronic graft‐versus‐host disease in children and adolescents (less than 18 years of age) after HSCT. Results We did not find any RCTs that analysed the efficacy of ECP for children and adolescents with cGvHD after HSCT. Current recommendations are only based on retrospective studies (where outcomes occurred to the participants before the study began) or observational studies (where investigators did not intervene, and simply observed the course of events). Ideally, ECP should only be given to children and adolescents in the context of RCTs. ECP may be considered in people with steroid‐refractory cGvHD, keeping in mind that such a treatment is not supported by high‐level evidence. If children and adolescents are given ECP, doctors should collect information about beneficial and harmful effects and set up registries for people treated with ECP.},

ISSN = {1465-1858},
abstract = {Abstract - Background Ovarian cancer tends to be chemosensitive and confine itself to the surface of the peritoneal cavity for much of its natural history. These features have made it an obvious target for intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy. Chemotherapy for ovarian cancer is usually given as an intravenous (IV) infusion repeatedly over five to eight cycles. Intraperitoneal chemotherapy is given by infusion of the chemotherapeutic agent directly into the peritoneal cavity. There are biological reasons why this might increase the anticancer effect and reduce some systemic adverse effects in comparison to IV therapy. Objectives To determine if adding a component of the chemotherapy regime into the peritoneal cavity affects overall survival, progression‐free survival, quality of life (QOL) and toxicity in the primary treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer. Search methods We searched the Gynaecological Cancer Review Group's Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) Issue 2, 2011, MEDLINE (1951 to May 2011) and EMBASE (1974 to May 2011). We updated these searches in February 2007, August 2010, May 2011 and September 2015. In addition, we handsearched and cascade searched the major gynaecological oncology journals up to May 2011. Selection criteria The analysis was restricted to randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing women with a new diagnosis of primary epithelial ovarian cancer, of any FIGO stage, following primary cytoreductive surgery. Standard IV chemotherapy was compared with chemotherapy that included a component of IP administration. Data collection and analysis We extracted data on overall survival, disease‐free survival, adverse events and QOL and performed meta‐analyses of hazard ratios (HR) for time‐to‐event variables and relative risks (RR) for dichotomous outcomes using RevMan software. Main results Nine randomised trials studied 2119 women receiving primary treatment for ovarian cancer. We considered six trials to be of high quality. Women were less likely to die if they received an IP component to chemotherapy (eight studies, 2026 women; HR = 0.81; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.72 to 0.90). Intraperitoneal component chemotherapy prolonged the disease‐free interval (five studies, 1311 women; HR = 0.78; 95% CI: 0.70 to 0.86). There was greater serious toxicity with regard to gastrointestinal effects, pain, fever and infection but less ototoxicity with the IP than the IV route. Authors' conclusions Intraperitoneal chemotherapy increases overall survival and progression‐free survival from advanced ovarian cancer. The results of this meta‐analysis provide the most reliable estimates of the relative survival benefits of IP over IV therapy and should be used as part of the decision making process. However, the potential for catheter related complications and toxicity needs to be considered when deciding on the most appropriate treatment for each individual woman. The optimal dose, timing and mechanism of administration cannot be addressed from this meta‐analysis. This needs to be addressed in the next phase of clinical trials. Plain language summary Intraperitoneal chemotherapy (administered into the peritoneal cavity) for advanced ovarian cancer improves both overall and disease‐free survival Ovarian cancer commonly spreads through the peritoneal cavity and usually responds to intravenous (IV) chemotherapy. This review compared the effectiveness of IV chemotherapy to chemotherapy administered directly into the peritoneal cavity (intraperitoneal, or IP). The evidence suggests an improvement in survival if some of the chemotherapy is administered via the intraperitoneal route. The disadvantage is an increase in adverse effects principally relating to the presence of a peritoneal catheter, including pain, catheter blockage, gastrointestinal effects and infection.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Anthracycline‐containing regimens (ACR) are the most prevalent regimens in the management of patients with advanced follicular lymphoma (FL). However, there is no proof that they are superior to non‐anthracycline‐containing regimens (non‐ACR). Objectives To compare the efficacy of ACRs to other chemotherapy regimens, in the treatment of FL. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library  2013, Issue 3), MEDLINE (January 1966 to April 2013), smaller databases, relevant conference proceedings (2004 to 2012) and the National Medical Library (April 2013). Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing ACR with non‐ACR for adult patients with FL. We excluded trials in which immunotherapy, radiotherapy alone or stem‐cell transplantation were used in one arm alone. Our primary outcome was overall survival (OS). Secondary outcomes included disease control, as measured by progression‐free survival (PFS) or remission duration (RD). Data collection and analysis Two review authors assessed the quality of trials and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We analyzed trials separately according to resemblance of the chemotherapeutic regimens in study arms, other than the addition of anthracyclines ('same' versus 'different' chemotherapy). Hazard ratios (HR) and risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated and pooled using the fixed‐effect model. Main results Eight RCTs, conducted between 1974 and 2011, and involving 2636 patients were included in this meta‐analysis. All trials included therapy‐naive patients. Rituximab was used in one trial only. Follow‐up was between three and five years in most trials (range three to 18 years). All trials were published in peer‐reviewed journals. Five trials compared similar chemotherapeutic regimens, except for the anthracycline. In three studies reporting overall survival specifically in FL patients, there was no statistically significant difference between ACR and non‐ACR arms (HR 0.99; 95% CI 0.77 to 1.29; I 2  = 0%). ACR significantly improved disease control (HR 0.65; 95% CI 0.52 to 0.81; four trials). Progression or relapse at three years were reduced (RR 0.73; 95% CI 0.63 to 0.85). Anthracyclines did not significantly increase rates of complete response (RR 1.05; 95% CI 0.94 to 1.18) or overall response (RR 1.06; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.12), but heterogeneity was substantial. Overall, ACR were more often associated with cytopenias, but not with serious infections or death related to chemotherapy. Cardiotoxicity, albeit rare, was associated with anthracycline use (RR 4.55; 95% CI 0.92 to 22.49; four trials). Three trials added anthracycline to one arm of two different regimens. None showed benefit to ACR regarding OS, yet there was a trend in favor of anthracyclines for disease control. Results were heterogeneous. We judged the overall quality of these trials as moderate as all are unblinded, some are outdated and are not uniform in outcome definitions. Authors' conclusions The use of anthracyclines in patients with FL has no demonstrable benefit on overall survival, although it may have been mitigated by the more intense regimens given in the control arms of three of five trials. ACR improved disease control, as measured by PFS and RD with an increased risk for side effects, notably cardiotoxicity. The current evidence on the added value of ACR in the management of FL is limited. Further studies involving immunotherapy during induction and maintenance may change conclusion. Plain language summary Anthracyclines in the treatment of follicular lymphoma (FL) in adults FL is the most common indolent non‐Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). It is a slowly progressive disease, with a risk of transformation to a more aggressive lymphoma. Advanced disease (stage III and IV) has been considered incurable. However, in recent years, the use of combination therapy and treatment with the monoclonal anti‐CD20 antibody rituximab, have prolonged survival and decreased transformation rate, and is now considered standard of care in FL patients. One of the most common chemotherapies used in the treatment of FL is the combination of rituximab with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, adriamycin, prednisone (R‐CHOP), which contains an anthracycline (adriamycin). Other anthracycline‐containing regimens (ACR) have also been used to treat FL patients. However, there is no proof that ACRs are better than non‐anthracycline‐containing regimens (non‐ACRs), and there are no standard guidelines for the initial treatment of advanced FL. Importantly, anthracyclines have serious side effects, notably a decrease in blood counts and potential damage to the heart, depending on the dose. The aim of this systematic review and meta‐analysis was to examine if there is a benefit in the use of anthracyclines for patients with FL. We looked at overall survival (OS); measures of disease control; response rates; and side effects. We found eight randomized controlled trials, of which five compared similar chemotherapy regimens in both trial arms, except for the anthracycline. Even among these five trials, three included more intense chemotherapy in the control arm. Most trials were conducted in the 1980s and 1990s. Only one of them included rituximab as part of the chemotherapy regimen. Almost all patients were treatment‐naive with advanced disease. Follow‐up ranged between three and five years in most trials. The main results from this set of trials are. 1. There is no evidence that OS is prolonged with the use of anthracyclines, although it may have been hampered by the more intense regimens given in the control arms of three of five trials. 2. Anthracyclines improved disease control. Concordantly, less patients progressed or relapsed within three years of treatment with ACR. 3. There is no statistically significant difference in complete or overall response rates. 4. Qualitatively, more side effects were reported with ACR, myelotoxicity and cardiotoxicity included. This evidence is limited, mainly due to disparities in regimens between control and study arms, but also since most included trials were conducted over one to two decades ago, and only one employed rituximab. Importantly, results from this study were in agreement with pooled‐outcomes from trials of the pre‐rituximab era. It is essential to find the optimal chemotherapeutic regimen in conjunction with rituximab and other novel agents, and understand the role of anthracyclines in this combination, especially with current methods that are able to reduce their toxicity. With longer follow‐up periods we may better understand whether improved disease control will eventually translate to an increase in survival.},

ISSN = {1465-1858},
abstract = {Abstract - Background The liver is affected by two groups of malignant tumours: primary liver cancers and liver metastases. Liver metastases are significantly more common than primary liver cancer, and five‐year survival after radical surgical treatment of liver metastases ranges from 28% to 50%, depending on primary cancer site. However, R0 resection (resection for cure) is not feasible in most people; therefore, other treatments have to be considered in the case of non‐resectability. One possible option is based on the concept that the blood supply to hepatic tumours originates predominantly from the hepatic artery. Transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) of the peripheral branches of the hepatic artery can be achieved by administering a chemotherapeutic drug followed by vascular occlusive agents and can lead to selective necrosis of the cancer tissue while leaving normal liver parenchyma virtually unaffected. The entire procedure can be performed without infusion of chemotherapy and is then called bland transarterial embolisation (TAE). These procedures are usually applied over a few sessions. Another possible treatment option is systemic chemotherapy which, in the case of colorectal cancer metastases, is most commonly performed using FOLFOX (folinic acid, 5‐fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin) and FOLFIRI (folinic acid, 5‐fluorouracil, and irinotecan) regimens applied in multiple sessions over a long period of time. These therapies disrupt the cell cycle, leading to death of rapidly dividing malignant cells. Current guidelines determine the role of TAE and TACE as non‐curative treatment options applicable in people with liver‐only or liver‐dominant metastatic disease that is unresectable or non‐ablatable, and in people who have failed systemic chemotherapy. Regarding the treatment modalities in people with colorectal cancer liver metastases, we found no systematic reviews comparing the efficacy of TAE or TACE versus systemic chemotherapy. Objectives To evaluate the beneficial and harmful effects of transarterial embolisation (TAE) or transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) compared with systemic chemotherapy in people with liver‐dominant unresectable colorectal cancer liver metastases. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and three additional databases up to 4 April 2024. We also searched two trials registers and the European Medicines Agency database and checked reference lists of retrieved publications. Selection criteria We included randomised clinical trials assessing beneficial and harmful effects of TAE or TACE versus systemic chemotherapy in adults (aged 18 years or older) with colorectal cancer liver metastases. Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were all‐cause mortality; overall survival (time to mortality); and any adverse events or complications. Our secondary outcomes were cancer mortality; health‐related quality of life; progression‐free survival; proportion of participants dying or surviving with progression of the disease; time to progression of liver metastases; recurrence of liver metastases; and tumour response measures (complete response, partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease). For the purpose of the review and to perform necessary analyses, whenever possible, we converted survival rates to mortality rates, as this was our primary outcome. For the analysis of dichotomous outcomes, we used the risk ratio (RR); for continuous outcomes, we used the mean difference; and for time to event outcomes, we calculated hazard ratios (HRs), all with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We used the standardised mean difference with 95% CIs when the trials used different instruments. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome. We based our conclusions on outcomes analysed at the longest follow‐up. Main results We included three trials with 118 participants randomised to TACE versus 120 participants to systemic chemotherapy. Four participants were excluded; one due to disease progression prior to treatment and three due to decline in health. The trials reported data on one or more outcomes. Two trials were performed in China and one in Italy. The trials differed in terms of embolisation techniques and chemotherapeutic agents. Follow‐up ranged from 12 months to 50 months. TACE may reduce mortality at longest follow‐up (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.94; 3 trials, 234 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), but the evidence is very uncertain. TACE may have little to no effect on overall survival (time to mortality) (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.01; 1 trial, 70 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), any adverse events or complications (3 trials, 234 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), health‐related quality of life (2 trials, 154 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), progression‐free survival (1 trial, 70 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), and tumour response measures (presented as the overall response rate) (RR 1.81, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.96; 3 trials, 234 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), but the evidence is very uncertain. No trials reported cancer mortality, proportion of participants dying or surviving with progression of the disease, and recurrence of liver metastases. We found no trials comparing the effects of TAE versus systemic chemotherapy in people with colorectal cancer liver metastases. Authors' conclusions The evidence regarding effectiveness of TACE versus systemic chemotherapy in people with colorectal cancer liver metastases is of very low certainty and is based on three trials. Our confidence in the results is limited due to the risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, and imprecision. It is very uncertain whether TACE confers benefits with regard to reduction in mortality, overall survival (time to mortality), reduction in adverse events or complications, improvement in health‐related quality of life, improvement in progression‐free survival, and tumour response measures (presented as the overall response rate). Data on cancer mortality, proportion of participants dying or surviving with progression of the disease, and recurrence of liver metastases are lacking. We found no trials assessing TAE versus systemic chemotherapy. More randomised clinical trials are needed to strengthen the body of evidence and provide insight into the benefits and harms of TACE or TAE in comparison with systemic chemotherapy in people with liver metastases from colorectal cancer. Plain language summary Is transarterial (chemo)embolisation better than systemic chemotherapy for treating bowel cancer that has spread to the liver? Key messages – Transarterial chemoembolisation (abbreviated as TACE) is a method of destroying cancer cells by giving anticancer medicines and tiny beads that block the blood supply to the tumour directly or giving beads that are coated with anticancer medication. TACE may reduce deaths compared with an anticancer medicine that is given by injection into a blood vessel travelling to cells all over the body (called systemic chemotherapy), but the evidence is very uncertain. TACE may have little to no effect on time to death, unwanted effects, quality of life, the length of time people survived without the cancer getting worse, and changes in the size of tumours, but the evidence is very uncertain. – We found no studies assessing another method of destroying cancer cells called transarterial embolisation (which is similar to TACE in that tiny beads are injected but differs in that no anticancer medicines are given; abbreviated as TAE) versus systemic chemotherapy. – Further research is needed as we found only three small studies and confidence in these results is limited. New studies might bring additional evidence and change the results and our confidence in them. What are metastases? Metastases are new cancer growths that spread to different parts of the body from the original cancer site (sometimes called secondaries). One of the most common sites for colorectal (bowel) cancer metastases is the liver. How are metastases treated? There are several different ways to treat liver metastases. We were interested in comparing three methods; transarterial chemoembolisation (abbreviated as TACE), transarterial embolisation (abbreviated as TAE), and systemic chemotherapy. TACE involves injection of an anticancer medicine and an injection of tiny beads directly into the blood vessel (the hepatic artery) that feeds the tumour or the use of beads that are coated in anticancer medication. The anticancer medicine is toxic and the beads block the blood supply to the tumour, so some of the tumour cells die. Other parts of the liver are kept alive as they receive their blood supply mainly from a different blood vessel (the portal vein). TAE is similar to TACE in that an injection of tiny beads is given to block the blood vessel but differs in that no anticancer medicines are given. Systemic chemotherapy is where anticancer medicines are given through a blood vessel on the back of the hand or forearm (usually) so they travel to, and affect, all cells in the body. What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out if TACE or TAE was better than systemic chemotherapy by looking at deaths, how long people survived, how often cancer returned and progressed (got worse), how the treatments affected how well the people felt, and if there were any unwanted effects. What did we do? We searched for studies comparing TACE or TAE versus systemic chemotherapy in people with bowel cancer that had spread to the liver. What did we find? We found three small studies with 238 people with metastases only or mainly in the liver that compared TACE versus systemic chemotherapy. It was not possible to remove the cancers with surgery. The studies reported no details on funding. We found no studies comparing TAE versus systemic chemotherapy in people with colorectal cancer liver metastases. TACE compared with systemic chemotherapy may reduce death, but the evidence is very uncertain (3 studies, 234 people). About 79 out of 100 people died with TACE compared with 92 out of 100 people with systemic chemotherapy. One small study (70 people) reported time to death, but we were very uncertain about the results. People who received TACE survived about 22 months, while those who received systemic chemotherapy survived about 15 months. In one small study (70 people), people who had TACE had a longer time before their cancer got worse in the liver (seven months) compared with those who received systemic chemotherapy (four months), but we were very uncertain about the results. We were very uncertain about the effects of TACE compared with systemic chemotherapy when looking at how metastases changed in size and unwanted effects. There was no information on the likelihood of death specifically due to cancer, the proportion of people dying or surviving with worsening of the disease, and recurrence (return) of liver metastases. What are the limitations of the evidence? Our confidence in the results is limited because none of the studies clearly reported their methods. It was unclear whether investigators, healthcare staff, and people taking part in the studies knew what treatment they had received. Not all the studies provided data about everything that we were interested in. All of this could have influenced the results. Further research is needed, which may change the results. How up to date is this evidence? The evidence is up to date to 4 April 2024.},

Antibody therapy is a successful new treatment option in adult lymphoma. However, none of the therapeutic antibodies available for adults with cancer have been approved for treatment of paediatric lymphoma. Objectives To assess the efficacy of antibody therapy for childhood lymphoma in terms of survival, response and relapse rates, compared with therapy not including antibody treatment. To assess quality of life and the occurrence of adverse effects caused by antibody therapy treatment in children compared with therapy not including antibody treatment. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2014, Issue 10), MEDLINE in PubMed (from 1945 to October 2014), EMBASE in EMBASE.com (from 1980 to October 2014) and reference lists of relevant articles. Furthermore, we searched conference proceedings abstracts of SIOP, ASCO and ASH for studies from 2009 to 2013), and the World Health Organization (WHO) ICTRP portal and ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing trials. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trials comparing conventional therapy with antibody therapy in children with lymphoma. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently performed the study selection. Main results We found no studies meeting the inclusion criteria of the review. Authors' conclusions At this moment, it is not possible to draw evidence‐based conclusions regarding clinical practice. Phase I and II studies show a positive effect of using antibody therapy in childhood lymphoma. Further research is needed to evaluate and implement antibody therapy for paediatric lymphoma. Plain language summary Antibody therapies for lymphoma in children Review question The objective of this review was to assess the efficacy of the treatment of lymphoma in children with antibody therapy in terms of survival, relapse rates and response to treatment, compared with therapy not including antibody treatment. Furthermore, it aimed to evaluate the effects of antibody therapy on quality of life and side effects. Background Lymphomas are the third most common cancer of childhood. They are cancer of the lymphatic system, which is part of the immune system and protects the body from infection. They often present as painless masses, accompanied by signs and symptoms resulting from local compression, as well as other signs and symptoms, such as fever and weight loss. Cure rates are high, exceeding 80%, but over the past years a plateau has been reached. Furthermore, cure rates for recurrent disease are dramatically lower. The long term effects of chemotherapy (chemicals used to treat cancer) are of great concern. Therefore, new treatments must be developed. Antibodies are produced by our bodies to help fight infection. Treatment with antibodies (antibody therapy) is a successful new treatment option in adults with lymphoma. However, none of the therapeutic antibodies available for adults with cancer have been approved for treatment of paediatric lymphomas. Monoclonal antibodies are proteins that recognise specific proteins on the surface of our body's cells. This binding could be used as a therapy for cancer. Binding of the antibody could result in direct cell death, or could mark the cells that need to be cleared by our body using the immune system. Search date 8 October 2014. Study characteristics We included only studies comparing the use of antibody therapy to the standard care in identical groups of children. Study funding sources We included no studies in our analysis. Key results We found no studies. The authors analysed 27 publications investigating the safety and tolerability of two antibody therapies, rituximab and brentuximab vedotin, in children with various types of lymphoma. These trials indicated that antibody therapy is safe to use in children and is well tolerated. Furthermore, there seems to be a positive effect on survival rates. To further evaluate the effects randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) must be performed. Use of statistics We performed no analyses. Quality of the evidence We found no studies.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Tuberculous pericarditis can impair the heart's function and cause death; long term, it can cause the membrane to fibrose and constrict causing heart failure. In addition to antituberculous chemotherapy, treatments include corticosteroids, drainage, and surgery. Objectives To assess the effects of treatments for tuberculous pericarditis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register (27 March 2017); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), published in the Cochrane Library (2017, Issue 2); MEDLINE (1966 to 27 March 2017); Embase (1974 to 27 March 2017); and LILACS (1982 to 27 March 2017). In addition we searched the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) search portal using 'tuberculosis' and 'pericard*' as search terms on 27 March 2017. We searched ClinicalTrials.gov and contacted researchers in the field of tuberculous pericarditis. This is a new version of the original 2002 review. Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened search outputs, evaluated study eligibility, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data; and we resolved any discrepancies by discussion and consensus. One trial assessed the effects of both corticosteroid and  Mycobacterium indicus pranii  treatment in a two‐by‐two factorial design ;  we excluded data from the group that received both interventions. We conducted fixed‐effect meta‐analysis and assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Main results Seven trials met the inclusion criteria; all were from sub‐Saharan Africa and included 1959 participants, with 1051/1959 (54%) HIV‐positive. All trials evaluated corticosteroids and one each evaluated colchicine,  M. indicus pranii  immunotherapy, and open surgical drainage. Four trials (1841 participants) were at low risk of bias, and three trials (118 participants) were at high risk of bias. In people who are not infected with HIV, corticosteroids may reduce deaths from all causes (risk ratio (RR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 1.09; 660 participants, 4 trials,  low certainty evidence ) and the need for repeat pericardiocentesis (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.04; 492 participants, 2 trials,  low certainty evidence ). Corticosteroids probably reduce deaths from pericarditis (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.80; 660 participants, 4 trials,  moderate certainty evidence ). However, we do not know whether or not corticosteroids have an effect on constriction or cancer among HIV‐negative people ( very low certainty evidence ). In people living with HIV, only 19.9% (203/1959) were on antiretroviral drugs. Corticosteroids may reduce constriction (RR 0.55, 0.26 to 1.16; 575 participants, 3 trials,  low certainty evidence ). It is uncertain whether corticosteroids have an effect on all‐cause death or cancer ( very low certainty evidence ); and may have little or no effect on repeat pericardiocentesis (RR 1.02, 0.89 to 1.18; 517 participants, 2 trials,  low certainty evidence ). For colchicine among people living with HIV, we found one small trial (33 participants) which had insufficient data to make any conclusions about any effects on death or constrictive pericarditis. Irrespective of HIV status, due to very low certainty evidence from one trial, it is uncertain whether adding  M. indicus pranii  immunotherapy to antituberculous drugs has an effect on any outcome. Open surgical drainage for effusion may reduce repeat pericardiocentesis In HIV‐negative people (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.76; 122 participants, 1 trial,  low certainty evidence ) but may make little or no difference to other outcomes. We did not find an eligible trial that assessed the effects of open surgical drainage in people living with HIV. The review authors found no eligible trials that examined the length of antituberculous treatment needed nor the effects of other adjunctive treatments for tuberculous pericarditis. Authors' conclusions For HIV‐negative patients, corticosteroids may reduce death. For HIV‐positive patients not on antiretroviral drugs, corticosteroids may reduce constriction. For HIV‐positive patients with good antiretroviral drug viral suppression, clinicians may consider the results from HIV‐negative patients more relevant. Further research may help evaluate percutaneous drainage of the pericardium under local anaesthesia, the timing of pericardiectomy in tuberculous constrictive pericarditis, and new antibiotic regimens. 2 April 2019 Up to date All studies incorporated from most recent search All eligible published studies found in the last search (27 Mar, 2017) were included and one ongoing study was identified (see 'Characteristics of ongoing studies' section) Plain language summary Treatment for tuberculosis infection of the membrane around the heart What is the issue? Tuberculosis infection of the pericardium surrounding the heart is uncommon but life‐threatening. What is the aim of this review? The aim of this Cochrane Review was to assess the effects of treatments for people with tuberculous pericarditis. What is this important? Doctors prescribe antituberculous drugs for six months, drain fluid from the pericardium if the patient has heart failure, and sometimes remove the pericardium if it is thick and making the patient ill and sometimes give corticosteroids to reduce the effects of the inflammation. What are the main results of the review? Cochrane researchers collected and examined all potentially relevant studies and found seven trials, all conducted in sub‐Saharan Africa. Six trials evaluated corticosteroids. Other treatments evaluated included  Mycobacterium indicus pranii  immunotherapy, colchicine, and surgical removal of fluid under general anaesthesia. This review is a new edition of the 2002 review. In people not infected with HIV, six trials found that additional steroids may reduce deaths overall ( low certainty evidence ) and probably reduce deaths caused by pericarditis ( moderate certainty evidence ). Steroids may prevent reaccumulation of fluid in the pericardial space ( low certainty evidence ). However, we do not know whether or not corticosteroids have an effect on constriction or cancer among HIV‐negative people ( very low certainty evidence ). In people living with HIV, most people evaluated in the included trials were not on antiretroviral drugs. For these patients, corticosteroids may reduce constrictive pericarditis ( low certainty evidence ), but we do not know if this translates into a reduction in the number of deaths or cancer ( very low certainty evidence ). Corticosteroids may have little or no effect on reaccumulation of fluid in the pericardial space ( low certainty evidence ). Colchicine was evaluated in one trial of 33 people, with insufficient data to make any conclusions about an effect. Based on one trial, it is uncertain whether adding  M. indicus pranii  immunotherapy to antituberculous drugs has an effect on any outcome in people with tuberculous pericarditis regardless of their HIV status ( very low certainty evidence ). Open surgical drainage of the fluid accumulating between the heart and the membrane using general anaesthesia may be associated with less life‐threatening reaccumulation of fluid in people who are not infected with HIV, but conclusions are not possible as the number of participants studied was too small. We did not find an eligible trial that assessed the effects of open surgical drainage in people living with HIV. The review authors found no eligible trials that examined the length of antituberculous treatment needed nor the effects of other adjunctive treatments for tuberculous pericarditis. How up‐to‐date is this review? The review authors searched for trials published up to 27 March 2017.},
